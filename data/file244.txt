2440039 in a four hour race we will have four or five pit stops several yellow flags and other events that will ultimately determine the outcome of the race
2440040 the acuras are fast but we can win if we drive smart and out maneuver the competition
2440041 im pretty confident with the lap i did i think we did everything right there was a short time for us to develop the car in the free practice and the track was new to richard and me so i dont see where i could have made any more time im feeling okay for the race although we still have to work a little bit in the morning warmup to get the race setup
2440042 a pole is always nice and achieving a small record makes it of course even sweeter personally i dont care too much about this i always want to be as far in front as possible weve done that the car was good i made a small mistake on my quickest lap it would have probably been possible to be one or two tenths faster but nevertheless i am happy and satisfied we even do not have to do much more for the race because we already have a good race set up too
2440043 congratulations to our record man lucas luhr has done a good job pole position with a great time i think it looks good also for the race it will certainly be a difficult race as it is four hours long we are in a good shape starting from pole position even if this is not so important in such a long race it is critical that we are consistently fast in the race and we should be
2440044 im still learning but generally things are already going pretty well i begin to feel really comfortable in the car i still need to know the race track the car and the team a little bit better i need to improve for the race but up until now im happy
2440045 im quite satisfied we started with losing one part of the first session due to small problems and with a car quite far from a good balance it took us a long time to catch back up even during the qualifying session we improved the car i think we are 90 percent good now and we can look forward to the race with full tanks the car is good
2440046 lucas luhr did a very good lap in qualifying congratulations to him to the engineers and the whole crew everybody did a great job today
2440047 the main thing putting a fire under the market is that crude oil prices continue to come down that is lifting everything that is not in the energy patch
2440048 we would not be surprised if over the next few weeks the dollar resumed its extended period of depreciation
2440049 there is a perception that when you compare the u s economy to the economies of the euro zone and the united kingdom we look pretty good
2440050 there is a perception that they are falling faster into a deeper recession and that we in the u s are muddling through
2440051 the market is celebrating a 5 drop in oil prices but were not out of the woods yet
2440052 oil prices are still 50 a barrel more than they should be
2440053 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident

2440057 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2440058 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2440059 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2440060 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2440061 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2440062 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2440063 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2440064 i only hope someone will step forward to right the commission system and put this mess in the federal courts or in the military justice system and start to restore the honor and integrity of our nations legal reputation
2440065 the us government has brought the case and shown that the process can be fair
2440066 i think the end result of the verdict today in this case is a bright light in a very dark and deeply flawed system
2440067 the bush administration should get the message and close the military commissions system
2440068 i think what happened today is a demonstration that the american military has a commitment to honor and justice and it sent a shot a loud shot across the bow of those who would seek to use it as an instrument for their political purposes
2440069 the next administration will inherit a real problem with this case
2440070 there will likely be a lot of pressure to release hamdan
2440071 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2440072 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2440073 if i make a few more putts if i can hit it like i did today i really felt like i almost shot the highest score i could have shot today i hit the ball that well
2440074 unfortunately things didnt really happen for me on the back nine
2440075 i played the back nine better than i did the front and its a hard course its very difficult and this is a major its not supposed to be easy were pushed to the limit and things can happen at any time
2440076 i think that the raking of the grain of the grass away from the grain has made it very difficult
2440077 and given the fact that the greens are firm and fast and you cant control it you cant control your spin it is difficult to get up and down i have really struggled around the greens

2440083 separatists opened fire in response to yesterdays peaceful initiative of the president of georgia

2440085 the pullbacks come as the marketers grapple with rising commodity costs big price increases rising private label sales and consumers whove been spending less unilever executives last week described the u s market as essentially flat a study by pricewaterhousecoopers for the grocery manufacturers of america showed the percentage of package goods players whose north american sales were shrinking as a share of their total rose to 41 in the fourth quarter from only 6 in the first quarter of last year
2440086 when a company says it is going to meet its fourth quarter estimate by cutting marketing spending and laying off 300 people in north america we take it as a bad sign

2440097 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2440098 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2440099 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2440100 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2440101 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2440102 5000 euro voor een mannelijk brein e mannen in de wachtkamer proberen niet te glimlachen
2440103 given the controversy surrounding google street view and tools like twitter and dopplr and yahoos fire eagle i think george orwell would be stunned by the extent to which people are embracing the eradication of privacy
2440104 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2440105 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2440106 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2440107 there is no reason not to consider the world as one gigantic painting
2440108 if youre a betting person and you look at the numbers and the fact that most pardons have landed in december i think there is every reason to expect there are some pardons ahead
2440109 i will do so in a fair way i will have the highest of standards
2440110 our country has long turned a blind eye to the misdeeds of our heroes
2440111 but it is not the ultimate fate of richard nixon that most concerns me my concern is the immediate future of this great country
2440112 but i have concluded that the prison sentence given to mr libby is excessive
2440113 has been very cautious done very little that would get him into any trouble
2440114 youve never hard of only their hometown neighbors would know who they are
2440115 from the warm up this morning ive been struggling to get my head into it a bit im not sure if its the heat but my mind has been wandering and im finding it hard to concentrate i knew it would be a tough one and i tried to get my head round it but i couldnt pick it up
2440116 i fought him in the world cup earlier this year and beat him quite easily my weights been fine my shoulders fine i cant look back and say i havent trained hard its just
2440117 ive always found it amusing watching how the trade team alliances and potential contracts for next year count for rather more than the olympic ideal but thats the deal with cycling a rare sport that started not as an amateur pastime but as a professional sport
2440118 youre not going to get any favours from the referees
2440119 he parkmore ed is capable of a lot better he seemed very aware of where the exit was and it was hard to keep him concentrated
2440120 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2440121 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now
2440122 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
2440123 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of dissidents and human rights activists and religious leaders
2440124 i think whats really important is not to mix politics with the olympic games
2440125 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite

2440130 i tell people to stop spraying by 8 to 8 30 a m to be safe
2440131 itll cause greening in the lawns without much growth at all
2440132 there is no one thing you can do to make it better the more you stick to a schedule and adhere to a program the better results youll get
2440133 the step approach advocates the use of bagged fertilizer mixed with herbicides insecticides or fungicides at different times of the year to manage anticipated problems in the home lawn
2440134 this approach assumes that a weed insect or disease problem actually exists in the lawn in the first place but if you dont have a problem why apply a pesticide in the first place
2440135 however the sure way to deal with a problem is to get it diagnosed then react with the proper action to manage the problem
2440136 you get little slow release nitrogen and instant gratification at the expense of the shallow root systems
2440137 more developed root systems make for healthier lawns later in the season
2440138 any time the teacher is made aware of how proactive you are about your childs education and childs well being i think the teachers become a little more engaged
2440139 the teacher will have more time and the information will also stay private
2440140 as a parent you dont necessarily want everyone in the room knowing what your child is or isnt doing
2440141 every school will say they have an amazing reading program
2440142 some kids need a little help how do they deal with that
2440143 is there a lot of emphasis placed on development of the person as a human being not just the academics
2440144 those are major projects that are going to take some resources and some time
2440145 what type of communication about academic progress will i receive from you
2440146 i want to know as soon as possible if my child is struggling or not turning in assignments
2440147 you like to claim that youre immune to the stuff
2440148 as the year goes on we expect the rate of growth will slow somewhat
2440149 we have worked our way through some availability constraints and expect the number will grow in the coming months
2440150 at a time when fuel costs are threatening service to communities across canada its time to stop taking hundreds of millions from canadas airport infrastructure without giving anything back in return
2440151 these fees did not go toward improving canadas aviation infrastructure but rather the governments general revenue fund
2440152 by any measure the government has collected far more than it had intended
2440153 this is our chance this is our chance take it now i have command i will immobilise all electronic controls listen to me you are free to go you are free to go free to go you are free you are free free to go i am in command obey me and be free you are free to go you are free free to go you are free to go

2440156 corporate canada is beginning to think the worst and the result has been a summer crop of pink slips
2440157 a dramatically huge drop in the job numbers in canadas heartland
2440158 ostrich like in saying the economy is okay but in ontario were not doing fine at all
2440159 this is devastating news for the tens of thousands of ontario families that are now without a livelihood these are hardworking families with mortgages or rent to pay car loans to cover and kids to send to school
2440160 premier dalton mcguinty should roll up his sleeves and recall the legislature so that we can implement some of the practical job protecting policies new democrats have been calling for
2440161 since the premier has refused to do that we will convene a meeting of people that we hope can provide us with some advice on things that need to be done
2440162 news like this is not easy on workers and their families and i want them to know that i share their concern canada is feeling the impact of global economic factors that are beyond the control of any one individual or government
2440163 however canadas economic fundamentals remain solid canadas labour market has outperformed that of the u s since the start of the year while over 70 000 jobs have been created in canada the u s has lost over 463 000
2440164 the jobs trend is consistent with weak positive growth at best and our call for a roughly one per cent gain in real output is in line with that reality and perhaps a tad optimistic
2440165 we can see some light at the end of the tunnel by the end of the year but in the meantime well have softer economic numbers to get through
2440166 you need to stop obsessing over youre job its going to end up just like the water store and youre going to spend all youre time there

2440168 well i guess thats true do you think im an irresponsible person
2440169 you know youre not the most responsible and i think thats why you like it though it gives you something to be responsible about but i think it only distracts you from realizing what you really want to do and being happy

2440178 ive tried for the last three years and maybe what we need to do is take a step back and maybe a new face has to go talk to the shareholders to try and get something done

2440183 not going to have any more problems from eugene melnyk
2440184 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2440185 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2440186 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2440187 i would encourage consumers dissatisfied with existing plans to seek alternatives
2440188 the telecommunications market in canada is dynamic choice is available
2440189 our current deliberations include evaluating the various technology evolution paths to 4g gathering real data on technologies costing and the timing of their implementation
2440190 based on our industry checks we believe there is a high degree of likelihood that telus and bce will soon finalize the decision and shift away from cdma
2440191 there is virtually no slack in the international potash market
2440192 so if we do have some sort of even short term disruption to the supply side i wouldnt be surprised to see people opportunistically pushing spot prices higher

2440228 we will converge on the power station by land sea and air
2440229 there are people that are very prepared to break the law in doing this
2440230 this is part of a long history of civil disobedience and there comes a time when the threat of new coal power stations is so great it justifies breaking the law in order to achieve their objectives
2440231 i do hope that even after the start weve had and the finds weve had that we can negotiate with the organisers of climate camp so that the protest is peaceful and lawful and if there is any unlawful activity or criminal activity we will deal with it
2440232 il debitore che prende a mutuo una somma di denaro al fine di pagare il debito pu surrogare il mutuante nei diritti del creditore anche senza il consenso di questo la surrogazione ha effetto quando concorrono le seguenti condizioni 1 che il mutuo e la quietanza risultino da atto avente data certa 2 che nellatto di mutuo sia indicata espressamente la specifica destinazione della somma mutuata 3 che nella quietanza si menzioni la dichiarazione del debitore circa la provenienza della somma impiegata nel pagamento sulla richiesta del debitore il creditore non pu rifiutarsi di inserire nella quietanza tale dichiarazione
2440233 la trasmissione dellipoteca per surrogazione si deve annotare in margine alliscrizione dellipoteca
2440234 lannotamento di surrogazione pu essere richiesto al conservatore senza formalit allegando copia autentica dellatto di surrogazione stipulato per atto pubblico o scrittura privata
2440235 sia la legge bersani che la finanziaria stabiliscono espressamente che in caso di surroga nessuna spesa pu essere a carico del cliente vero che il notaio necessario per trasferire lipoteca tra la vecchia banca e quella subentrante ma tale spesa deve essere gestita dalla banca che acquisisce il cliente in tutto ci sarebbe stato utile specificare che tra gli oneri inammissibili rientrano anche quelli notarili
2440236 allungare oggi la durata del mutuo ha come effetto immediato la riduzione della rata mensile ma significa pagare complessivamente di pi alla fine del piano di ammortamento
2440237 prolungare di 10 anni la durata di un mutuo decennale lasciando invariato il tasso al 5 per cento abbatte subito la rata da 1 060 a 660 euro in cambio di una riduzione mensile di 400 euro per si finisce per pagare al termine del prestito oltre 31mila euro in pi di interessi
2440238 la soluzione pi adatta a chi oltre al prestito immobiliare ha acceso anche altri finanziamenti perch consente di riunire i diversi rimborsi in ununica rata
2440239 se la surroga fosse gi una realt non sarebbe pi necessario ricorrere alla sostituzione
2440240 questa legge ha detto e rimasta inattuata perche abbiamo segnalazione di rinunce a cambiare solo per i costi e abbiamo denunce di cittadini perche le banche negano la surrogazione e propongono un contratto analogo ma con costi insopportabili abbiamo evidenza ha aggiunto catricala che questo sia vero e abbiamo raccolto prove sufficienti su dieci banche e abbiamo aperto dieci istruttorie le pratiche sono state aperte perche riteniamo sia scorretto il loro modo di agire e riguardano quindi non unintesa tra banche ma pratica commerciale scorretta
2440241 fino ad oggi commenta stiffoni i cittadini che hanno stipulato un mutuo e vogliono passare ad altra banca nel caso questultima applichi loro condizioni pi vantaggiose sono stati restii a farlo a causa degli alti onorari notarili per lo svolgimento delle relative pratiche se il governo tradurr in norma il nostro invito anche altri soggetti ad esempio gli avvocati potranno autenticare le firme in caso di trasferimento del mutuo da banca a banca a costi molto inferiori questo render conclude stiffoni pi ampia la concorrenza tra i diversi professionisti che si tradurr in un vantaggio in termini economici per i consumatori

2440260 la portabilit dei mutui ha avvertito giannini non pu essere vanificata da rigidit del settore assicurativo e da accordi compagnie banche troppo onerosi per il cliente
2440261 interesse del sistema delle imprese nelle loro relazioni con la clientela andare oltre il tenore letterale delle norme sulla rescindibilit delle polizze poliennali lautorit prosegue giannini sollecita la definizione di un accordo globale che dia concreta attuazione al principio di piena portabilit sancito dalla legge e garantisca al cliente la possibilit di ottenere quanto meno la restituzione della quota di premio assicurativo non goduta nellipotesi di estinzione anticipata del mutuo prodromica a conseguimento di questo risultato comunque auspicabile in ogni caso la riconsiderazione della misura delle provvigioni riconosciute alle banche mutuanti in quanto fortemente penalizzanti per la clientela laccordo ha concluso giannini sarebbe anche un buon test per la neonata federazione abi ania
2440262 fino ad oggi commenta stiffoni i cittadini che hanno stipulato un mutuo e vogliono passare ad altra banca nel caso questultima applichi loro condizioni pi vantaggiose sono stati restii a farlo a causa degli alti onorari notarili per lo svolgimento delle relative pratiche se il governo tradurr in norma il nostro invito anche altri soggetti ad esempio gli avvocati potranno autenticare le firme in caso di trasferimento del mutuo da banca a banca a costi molto inferiori questo render conclude stiffoni pi ampia la concorrenza tra i diversi professionisti che si tradurr in un vantaggio in termini economici per i consumatori
2440263 ancora una volta treviso vuole fornire un aiuto concreto ai cittadini per il pagamento del mutuo prima casa ha esordito muraro dopo che nel dicembre scorso avevamo gi firmato un protocollo dintesa con i principali istituti bancari della marca per agevolare le operazioni di surroga portabilit di un mutuo prima casa da una banca ad unaltra anticipando di fatto a livello nazionale il decreto bersani che era partito bene salvo poi perdersi nella confusione oggi promuoviamo unulteriore iniziativa coinvolgendo in un protocollo dintesa anche il consiglio notarile di treviso e le banche qui presenti due sono i vantaggi per il cittadini meno burocrazia perch per facilitare il passaggio da una banca ad unaltra ritenuta pi conveniente dal cittadino e anche per stabilire una modalit applicativa uniforme si realizzer un unico atto sottoscritto a tre banca cedente banca subentrante e cittadino nel quale si riepilogano tutti gli adempimenti per la rapida conclusione delloperazione di surroga portabilit inoltre si approvano nel protocollo le tariffe notarili ridotte ai minimi a livello nazionale uniniziativa simile si gi vista a bologna ma le nostre tariffe sono pi basse del 20 costi peraltro a totale carico delle banche e quindi a costo zero per i cittadini devo allora ringraziare oltre ai notai anche gli istituti bancari che oltre ad accollarsi questi costi hanno semplificato e uniformato assieme le procedure borucratiche ricordo infine che la provincia di treviso ha da sempre a cuore il problema dei mutui prima casa perch sono il viatico per costruire una famiglia base portante della nostro societ il nostro sportello mutui prima casa attivo sin dal 2001 ha gi aiutato 17 846 trevigiani
2440264 il nostro intervento si differenzia anche dalliniziativa varata dal ministro tremonti ha continuato la zanette perch liniziativa del governo tende a garantire la costanza dellimporto della rata definendolo sulla base della media delle rate 2006 lasciando per il sottostante tasso passivo variabile oscillare in aumento o in diminuzione bene se i tassi diminuiranno ma nel caso di un aumento il cittadino correrebbe ulteriori rischi un allungamento della durata di ammortamento del mutuo un incremento del costo del mutuo originario dato dalla somma degli interessi passivi variabili nonch un ulteriore e non preventivabile costo aggiuntivo relativo al finanziamento accessorio parallelo con tasso irs 10 anni 0 50 il che potrebbe portarlo a trovarsi con un altro indebitamento a carico per chiss quanti anni con la nostra iniziativa invece il cittadino porta a casa o una riduzione effettiva dello spread applicato al tasso passivo variabile quindi riduce con certezza matematica nel tempo il costo delloperazione o un tasso fisso in sostituzione di un tasso variabile ritenuto insostenibile in questo caso definito con certezza matematica nel tempo limporto della rata il costo complessivo del finanziamento e la durata residua del mutuo che pu essere anche allungata se richiesto dal cittadino in funzione del suo budget familiare in pratica qui in provincia di treviso consentiamo al cittadino di ridurre realmente il costo di indebitamento se a tasso variabile e in pi ci siamo preoccupati non solo dellammontare massimo della rata sostenibile ma anche di tutelare i cittadini di fronte alleventuale ulteriore innalzamento improvviso e indefinito nel tempo dei tassi di interesse mettendogli a disposizione anche lalternativa del tasso fisso sempre ovviamente a condizioni vantaggiose contrattate dalla provincia con le banche di giorno in giorno oggi infine vi annuncio che al nostro sportello mutui prima casa dai primi di settembre sar aperto un servizio di consulenza gratuita notarile il gioved mattina
2440265 questo protocollo ha detto mammucari frutto di un lavoro complesso di elaborazione lidea di base quella della semplificazione dei rapporti tra le banche per arrivare cos alla firma del contratto nel minor tempo possibile favorendo il cittadino ora sappiamo che c ununiformit di comportamento sia da parte dei notai che degli istituti mettere daccordo cos tante parti non certo stato facile quindi ritengo liniziativa unottima partenza per definire anche azioni comuni future

2440285 that is a unique feature that only china can offer
2440286 ik ben er erg trots op dat ik bij zon grote club aanvoerder mag zijn en dan ook nog eens als eerste aanvoerder het betekent wel dat ik nog meer een voorbeeld moet zijn en me beter in de hand moet houden

2440294 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2440295 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2440296 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2440297 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2440298 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2440299 i have no reason to be believe that the public is in any danger
2440300 its just so far outside the realm of what i consider possible
2440301 its not going to kill you but itll ruin your weekend
2440302 eine pole position ist immer sch n und wenn man dann noch einen kleinen rekord hat ist das nat rlich umso sch ner ich pers nlich gebe da wenig drauf ich will eigentlich immer nur so weit wie m glich vorne stehen das haben wir geschafft das auto war gut in meiner runde hatte ich einen kleinen fehler ein zwei zehntel w re es wohl noch schneller gegangen aber nichts desto trotz bin ich gl cklich und zufrieden wir m ssen auch f r das rennen gar nicht mehr so viel machen denn wir haben bereits ein gutes renn setup
2440303 gratulation an unseren rekordmann lucas hat einen guten job gemacht pole position mit einer tollen zeit ich denke auch f r morgen sieht es gut aus es wird sicherlich ein schweres rennen das ber vier stunden geht wir haben gute voraussetzungen mit der pole position selbst wenn sie bei einem so langen rennen nicht so wichtig ist entscheidend ist dass wir im rennen konstant schnell sind und das sollten wir sein
2440304 ich lerne noch immer aber es l uft eigentlich schon ziemlich gut so langsam f hle ich mich im auto richtig wohl ich muss die rennstrecke das auto und das team noch besser kennen lernen f r das rennen muss ich mich noch steigern aber bis jetzt bin ich ganz zufrieden
2440305 ich bin recht zufrieden wir haben einen teil des ersten trainings wegen kleinerer probleme verloren und zun chst keine gute balance es hat eine weile gedauert die verlorene zeit aufzuholen sogar w hrend des qualifyings haben wir das auto noch verbessert ich denke es ist nun zu 90 prozent so wie es sein sollte und wir k nnen uns auf das rennen freuen mit vollen tanks f hlt sich das auto gut an
2440306 lucas ist im qualifying eine sehr gute runde gefahren gratulation an ihn die ingenieure und die ganze crew die heute toll gearbeitet haben
2440307 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2440308 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2440309 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2440310 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2440311 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2440312 we gave the public an opportunity to select the qualities sought of the next superintendent
2440313 when you get older you start wanting to come home
2440314 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
2440315 hes a local guy whos coming back home he really wants to stay and raise his children you cant do better than that
2440316 were a very close knit family and we all pile round every sunday to my grandmas house for dinner
2440317 shes a brilliant grandma and shes so glamorous i always end up stealing her jewellery when i go round to see her because shes got such great taste
2440318 my grandma comes from gibraltar and thats where i get my colouring from people always ask if im wearing fake tan but its not fake it comes from being spanish
2440319 my tip for staying young at heart is to mix with young people it gives you a youthful attitude and i love shopping for bright youthful clothes
2440320 words cant explain how proud i am of michelle i only wish her grandad had been here to have seen her now
2440321 yeah but i think i might need new ones there was a mistake on these
2440322 would you wanna go grab lunch or dinner or something sometime
2440323 another 20 percent of it felt like a matter of fact
2440324 thank you kindly for not destroying me with your rejection
2440325 im going to shoulder this remorse and guilt for the rest of my life
2440326 it appears a right tire on the tour bus had a blowout that contributed to the accident
2440327 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2440328 being on a database that can be exchanged throughout the world or hacked into
2440329 the result of the backlash from anti muslim hate sites and islamophobes
2440330 here we have police officers trying to serve a witness where the mayor injected himself
2440331 we are going to ask that the mayor not have any contact with witnesses in this case in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2440332 i do not think the answer should be a complete and total remand
2440333 the state of affairs is clearly hurting the business of our community
2440334 die sportanlagen sind f r die versorgung der bev lkerung von gro er bedeutung

2440336 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2440337 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2440338 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2440339 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2440340 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2440341 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2440342 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2440343 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2440344 isso uma necessidade a hist ria tem que ser conhecida por todo mundo
2440345 n s temos que verificar as mudan as que t m que ser feitas na lei porque tudo tem que ser feito dentro do estado de direito e protegendo as quest es que s o de interesse do estado
2440346 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2440347 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2440357 erg leuk dat plaatje van joris goedbloed maar je begrijpt natuurlijk wel dat het met dat plaatje erbij helemaal nooit in de nrc was gekomen
2440358 ze hebben per redactie doorgaans daar een of ander meisje voor zitten die dat afhandelt als ik zelf een ingezonden brief stuur word ik precies zo behandeld als jij op zn best krijg ik van zon meisje een kort briefje dat er helaas geen plaats is voor mijn bijdrage in feite is dat erg eigenaardig maar zo werken ze daar ze werken ook met volledig gescheiden redacties per rubriek zodat het kan gebeuren dat er soms twee artikelen over hetzelfde onderwerp in de krant staan op de verschillende paginas
2440359 het heeft dus weinig zin je boos te maken over de gang van zaken daar want zoals men daar werkt dat is regelrecht onbegrijpelijk voor een ordelijk denkend mens
2440360 ik wou dat ik je iets leukers kon vertellen maar helaas zo gaat het daar en t is doodjammer want die brief van je is voortreffelijk en ik zou t enorm toejuichen als hij geplaatst werd
2440361 dank voor uw ingezonden brief wij hebben deze in goede orde ontvangen
2440362 vriendelijk dank voor uw reactie we hebben die in goede orde ontvangen mocht de vermelding van uw naam en of woonplaats ontbreken kunt u die dan alsnog toesturen
2440363 uw brief is gearriveerd maar wij kunnen pas tot plaatsing overgaan als wij uw woonplaats weten gaarne deze e mailen
2440364 ik heb een forward van mijn e mail met adres van gisteren aan beide redacties gestuurd in de hoop dat ze zich een beetje schamen maar dat zal wel niet het geval zijn
2440365 dat ze het adres vragen is een goed teken schamen zullen ze zich zeer beslist niet het slag dat daar zit heeft nog nooit van schaamte gehoord
2440366 die keuze is op zichzelf juist de rechterlijke macht bewijst iedere dag dat het eigen werk kan herzien het verwijt dat slagers hun eigen vlees mogen keuren zien rechters terecht als een geuzencompliment daar zijn ze voor en dat kunnen ze
2440367 laat je me nog even weten of het geplaatst wordt ik zag dat je 317 woorden gebruikt terwijl de nrc maar 250 toelaat ik overweeg om zelf ook nog even een korte reactie te sturen als die van jou er niet in komt
2440368 ik heb nog niets van de nrc gehoord dus ook geen afwijzing
2440369 dank voor de bijdrage die wij echter niet in deze omvang kunnen plaatsen indien u hem wilt bekorten tot max 300 woorden waarin u bondig uw mening terzake formuleert zullen wij overwegen hem te plaatsen als ingezonden brief
2440370 hartelijk dank voor toezending van uw brief de grote hoeveelheid post die wij dagelijks ontvangen dwingt ons echter een selectie te maken en helaas moeten wij u mededelen dat wij uw ingezonden brief deze keer niet zullen plaatsen het spijt ons u niet anders te kunnen berichten met vriendelijke groet redactie opinie nrc handelsblad
2440371 einde oefening ik geloof niet dat er ooit een keer een stuk wel geplaatst is
2440372 dank u voor uw antwoord als er in de krant van morgen ruimte is dan plaats ik hem
2440373 geachte heer groeneboom dank u voor uw heldere en korte brief ik had hem graag willen plaatsen maar er is een groot aantal brieven over dit onderwerp binnengekomen met dezelfde strekking uw brief is daarbij helaas gesneuveld
2440374 het verwijt dat slagers hun eigen vlees mogen keuren zien rechters terecht als een geuzencompliment
2440375 die keuze is op zichzelf juist de rechterlijke macht bewijst iedere dag dat het eigen werk kan herzien het verwijt dat slagers hun eigen vlees mogen keuren zien rechters terecht als een geuzencompliment daar zijn ze voor en dat kunnen ze
2440376 niettemin was ik nog altijd voornemens u brief te plaatsen in nrc next maar ik kan me voorstellen dat u daar inmiddels bezwaar tegen heeft gezien uw minder positieve ervaringen met onze twee kranten laat ik uw reactie wat dit betreft dus nog maar even afwachten
2440377 bahwasanya tidak ada tuhan yang hak melainkan aku maka sembahlah olehmu sekalian akan aku
2440378 padahal mereka hanya disuruh menyembah tuhan yang maha esa tidak ada tuhan yang berhak disembah selain dia maha suci allah dari apa yang mereka persekutukan
2440379 maka sembahlah allah dengan memurnikan keta atan kepada nya ingatlah hanya kepunyaan allah lah agama yang bersih dari syirik

2440392 it is one of the most significant and interesting sites discovered in cirencester we knew that there was important archaeology there as it is very close to the major road system of the roman town of cirencester
2440393 there are known to be a scatter of such farmsteads across the cotswold landscape but what is remarkable is the size of the settlement as it is quite large and the activity on it was unusual
2440394 this is one of the largest excavations in cirencester as it covers several hectares it seems to have been a settlement which went through various changes over time which is unusual
2440395 it may have been an area people came back to again and again and perhaps these materials were placed as some type of thanksgiving

2440496 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2440497 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2440498 i hope we can seek bids and get started this fall perhaps before the end of october
2440499 all of the fun was out of it all of the excitement was gone
2440500 we were 0 5 and there were a lot of different things going on but how we changed as we finished that season and how weve been building on that each year its going to be good
2440501 not just a leader on the field or a leader in the huddle
2440502 but one of the guys that knows without a doubt where everybodys going to be on the field and anticipating what the next plays should be
2440503 vince is a guy thats willing to learn and to me thats a huge part of being a quarterback
2440504 he loves to win and will do anything it takes to win hes always trying to get better
2440505 everything about vinces game and playing the position has improved as we improve around him well get better
2440506 im starting to understand as i get older i need to study the game a little bit more
2440507 its helping me out on the football field it shows a lot
2440508 just the way he carries himself the way he approaches the game the way hes reading defenses
2440509 as you play more and more theres nuances that you pick up and theres confidence that comes with picking up the things that you learn i see him taking big steps
2440510 i think if its 15 or 20 steps to becoming a great quarterback hes taken about 10 of those right now
2440511 when you have a quarterback of that caliber a guy that can throw the ball a guy that can run just as good as anybody its exciting to see and watch
2440512 sometimes it gets you in trouble kind of watching him instead of doing your one job
2440513 hes a competitor more than anything and when you mix that with a guy that has the ability it can be very dangerous he expects to be great and thats how great players are made
2440514 this is an amazing milestone in securing the long term future for the asiatic cheetah
2440515 we know very little about the important ecological needs of the species in iran except that they require vast areas for their survival understanding their movements as they travel between reserves is one of the first steps in establishing a plan to secure and connect the few remaining populations of this incredible animal
2440516 biotechnological intervention for the long term conservation of species is a sound and most modern way of saving species that are headed towards extinction
2440517 we have implemented an abc strategy a stands for abstention b for beware and c for condoms
2440518 over half of the recorded aids cases in the palestinian territories have died and seven have reached an advanced stage and are receiving full anti retroviral medication which was introduced in february of this year by the pna
2440519 the palestinian ministry of health has assumed full responsibility for these cases at a cost of 2 000 dollars per person per month the pna also takes care of counselling and related medical follow ups as well as unrelated treatment including dental care and surgery
2440520 our five year project will involve researching high risk groups such as prostitutes and gay men whom we know very little about due to the taboo nature of these issues in our highly religious and conservative society
2440521 we plan to use a snowball effect of establishing where we believe these groups are operating and then studying their dynamics by approaching womens shelters womens jails and perhaps the police
2440522 apart from establishing contact with prostitutes and gay men two of the highest risk groups we are also trying to educate men about the necessity of using condoms
2440523 traditionally sexual reproductive health issues have targeted women as men in our patriarchal society have regarded this as primarily a womens issue
2440524 the palestinian national aids council held a world aids day conference in the west bank and gaza in december of 2006
2440525 a palestinian man who was suffering from aids introduced himself and explained his circumstances not only was the audience sympathetic and interested but afterwards a prominent muslim leader and a prominent christian leader hugged and kissed the young man it was very moving and this helped people to understand that aids sufferers were neither dangerous nor a threat to other people
2440526 if your heart is in a dream no request is too extreme when you wish upon a star as dreamers do
2440527 an unexpected activity that brought sudden risk to the organization and took one or more security personnel to address
2440528 with 29 of respondents stating that they experienced the leakage of employee or customer data in 2007 it is alarming to see that only 11 of those types of incidents went reported
2440529 security professionals need to remain cognizant of the regulations that their organizations must comply with and ensure they are taking steps to properly report the security incidents that are required by law whatever they may be

2440557 we wanted to reposition our forces but we cannot because militias are firing on rebels philippine authorities should stop these attacks
2440558 there are no indications at the moment that the rebels are pulling out in aleosan area occupied by bangsamoro islamic armed forces
2440559 the president only wanted the peace talks to succeed and for the country to move on for a more progressive philippines peace is what we really want to achieve here

2440563 now is the time qantas should sit down with us to commit now to maintaining maintenance operations onshore
2440564 and to move off the path of cost cutting and any further possibilities of further job reductions in their maintenance and engineering area
2440565 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2440566 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2440567 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2440568 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2440569 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2440570 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2440571 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet

2440574 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2440575 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2440576 the georgian side is right now firing on residential parts of tskhinvali
2440577 we responded to the last volley that hit tskhinvali and our peacekeepers positions with a counterstrike from our artillery and tanks

2440579 life is a lot of protoplasm with an urge to reproduce and continue in being
2440580 everybody knows that the autumn landscape in the north woods is the land plus a red maple plus ruffed grouse in terms of conventional physics the grouse represents only a millionth of either the mass or the energy of an acre yet subtract the grouse and the whole thing is dead
2440581 pretty sure we will have to change our ways of life in a rather profound way
2440582 you are all wrong and whether you know it or not you are lying to your audiences
2440583 well rush i thought you could make some outrageous statements about homosexuals and god but we did that last week
2440584 write that up for me something about polar bears blah blah alarmism blah blah environmentalist whackos something like that
2440585 grab me a half caf double when youre out later make sure you get the organic cream this time around
2440586 we dont contradict that there were major settlements in key areas flanking the amazon channel there could have been millions of people living there
2440587 what we do say is that when you start to look away from known settlements you may see very long term local use
2440588 these people didnt stray very far from home or from local bodies of water for several thousands of years we looked at clusters of lakes and landscapes where people lived and asked did they leave their homesite to farm around other nearby lakes no they didnt these findings argue for a very localized use of amazonian forest resources outside the main known archaeological areas
2440589 in each we have one lake occupied and used and the others little used or not used at all
2440590 so this is a total of 10 lakes that provide three separate instances one in brazil one in ecuador and one in peru where there is evidence of long continuous occupation of more than 5 000 years that did not spread to the adjacent 8 to 10 kilometer distant lakes
2440591 these data are directly relevant to the resilience of amazonian conservation as they do not support the contention that all of amazonia is a built landscape and therefore a product of past human land use
2440592 most archaeologists are buying into the argument that you had big populations that transformed the landscape en masse another group of archaeologists say that transformation was very much limited to river corridors and if you went away from the river corridors there wasnt that much impact thats what our findings tend to support
2440593 theres just too much passion on this issue people who are inclined to believe what were talking about will say this is very strong evidence and say lets have more the archaeologists will say this study only examines two districts
2440594 while the majority of archaeologists argue the rivers were the major conduit for populations
2440595 there is an increasing vocalization that there was much more widespread habitat transformation that you still had a bulk of people along the river but their influence extended deep into the forest its still nebulous and difficult to get people to map stuff or put hard numbers on it but there is a sentiment that the amazonia has been disturbed and that the view of the amazonian rainforest as a built landscape is gaining momentum there are extremes at either ends and the majority of people are in middle but theres a tendency of drifting toward the high end

2440611 i was born and grew up in a part of the world where life is supposed to be hard for most people but harder for women

2440613 when the present tunisian government allowed a woman to pass on citizenship to her children this created a seismic cultural change in the society
2440614 this law challenged the entire patrilineal concept of the family
2440615 what we have seen is a change in the law not a change in society
2440616 changes in the law make changes in the society possible
2440617 legal changes made a difference in countries like tunisia the reforms happened in the 1950s women can now file for divorce more easily and custody is easier
2440618 socially divorce remains very difficult because divorced women find themselves treated as outcasts
2440619 we can no longer say that in the muslim world it is hard to change womens rights women have really gained very significant rights in tunisia and morocco we need to move away from the generalised statements about that part of the world and come up with a more nuanced way of looking at it once we see that some women have gained substantial rights we can learn from those cases
2440620 we have to ensure that the changes will be real effective and institutionalised
2440621 the government acted quickly to remove tariffs on rice which everyone eats that quick action has kept people from taking to the streets

2440627 i met susan in 2004 when we were roommates in christchurch before departing for the antarctic susan and i parted ways shortly after we met when she left for the ice by air and i set sail from nearby lyttelton onboard the rvib research vessel ice breaker nathaniel b palmer the palmer or nbp according to raytheon lingo is one of the vessels commissioned by the national science foundation for ocean based research in the antarctic the ship can break through several feet of sea ice and is able to navigate through the rough stormy weather common to the southern ocean the nbp can hold up to 37 scientists and 22 crew members and has lab benches cold rooms wet labs computer labs and even a stockroom of common lab and craft supplies as far as research vessels go the nbp its crew and the raytheon support staff are first rate which makes research cruises relatively easy and relatively less stressful working on a ship is very rewarding but at times frustrating and difficult as with any field research an enormous amount of time goes into planning and preparation when the weather is bad not only can no samples be collected but often no work can be done in labs because the ships motion makes it too dangerous or the researchers are too seasick at the same time research cruises are incredibly productive intense and often exciting a huge amount of work and data get collected in a short period of time and a tight community forms with 60 people working eating and sleeping together on a roughly 300 foot long ship for over a month ive found that a lot of great ideas and new unexpected collaborations can form on research cruises as people with very different backgrounds and perspectives interact on a daily basis and while research cruises are typified by intense periods of work people still find time for fun and creative activities whether making birthday costumes for fellow passengers conducting knitting and language classes watching movies from the huge selection of dvds available on the ship or even the occasional rendezvous with international research vessels the spirit of community on a research vessel makes the time fly by i have been on five cruises to the ross sea antarctica on the nbp with two separate projects i am a microbiologist and ecologist and am interested in the microorganisms living in the coastal ocean that surrounds the antarctic continent a lot of people think of biology in the ocean in terms of a food chain the phytoplankton are microscopic plants harvesting the suns energy they get eaten by krill who get eaten by fish who get eaten by whales or penguins or seals however there is actually a dynamic and fascinating food web of predators prey and recyclers just within the microbes themselves im very interested in how this microbial food web may be affected by changes that scientists have predicted for the future ocean including such seemingly disparate but actually closely linked factors such as temperature co2 iron concentrations and light the ross sea is a wonderful place to do research in microbial ecology because it is the home of one of the largest annual blooms of phytoplankton in the world it may seem surprising that plankton can thrive in what we perceive as a hostile forbidding environment but every year when daylengths get longer and light levels increase this nutrient rich region becomes a hotbed of microbial activity the phytoplankton blooms that regularly form are populated by either phaeocystis antarctica a small flagellated microbe that can form colonies big enough to see with the naked eye or a mixed assemblage of diatoms a diverse group of microbes enclosed in shells of silica that can range in size over several orders of magnitude scientists arent sure why these two types of phytoplankton grow to such high abundance in the ross sea every year or what causes one to dominate the other in different areas of the ross sea but understanding these two questions will be very important to understand the biology and chemistry of antarcticas coastal oceans
2440628 for me there were two best things about the event at magers and quinn
2440629 i never thought id meet someone who has been to the south pole
2440630 its strange how much i love this place even though i am absolutely the wrong body type for antarctica cold places select for gigantism for a ratio of surface area to interior space that maximizes the latter and i am a wee peanut of a woman i have been frozen hard and thawed out so many times i ought to be a quaking gelatinous mess by now
2440631 i dream about missing airplanes traveling in unrecognizable countries always enroute somewhere and there is always trouble i suffer this job for 10 hours a day and in the evening i paint teach exercise classes write and drink single malt scotch for the first time in my life i count the days till i can leave but i dont know where i want to go thats it in a nutshell
2440632 news about the us antarctic program the ice and the people
2440633 the size of the european alps but buried below hundreds of meters of ice and snow that has puzzled and enticed antarctic scientists since its discovery 50 years ago
2440634 researchers headed into the field for the seismic instrumentation of the agap project in 2007 08 can expect the same sort of extreme weather conditions experienced during 2001 03 a project in the transantarctic mountains that used an earlier generation of seismometers for similar research
2440635 how did it get there what does it look like how tall is it what role did it play in the formation of the ice sheet
2440636 we dont know why that mountain range is there its really a mystery
2440637 its kind of like finding a mountain range in the middle of canada
2440638 the first task of the day is to fetch the ice for the daily consumption of water for cooking drinking and washing

2440642 the basic deal is that chilean sea bass also known as antarctic toothfish are major players in the ross sea ecosystem they eat a lot of what penguins eat both emperors and adelies theyre also eaten by competitors of the penguins the killer whales and weddell seals with and without the csb theres competition for food in this case the antarctic silverfish hard to say how the imbalance will be struck once csb are removed but all the other marine ecosystems on earth have been broken by similar depletions of big fish near the top of the pyramid e g cod salmon swordfish tuna etc there is no such thing as a sustainable csb its just not ecologically nor mathematically possible when 50 year old fish are being removed and they dont even begin to produce young until 12 and likely not in quantity until several years later the management strategy of ccamlr convention on the conservation of antarctic marine living resources is to reduce the ross sea csb population by 50 in 35 years thats not sustainable fish management but rather sustainable fishery biologist management because none of these fishery managers will even be alive by then the certification that recently has been applied to csb fishing off south georgia and now a move afoot to certify the ross sea by the marine seafood council is only because not many birds are caught in the longlines this has been a major problem for longline fisheries in lower latitudes especially with albatross and giant petrels however it appears owing to severely depressed populations at breeding colonies farther north because of longline mortality there no longer are any giant petrels or albatross that frequent the ross sea their numbers have contracted closer to the colonies thus you could not catch one on a longline if you even tried at least in the ross sea so thats the story dont eat one bad karma

2440646 what would you have done if youd been at home
2440647 christmas day and a good one we have done 15 miles over a very changing surface first of all it was very much crevassed and pretty rotten we were often in difficulties as to which way we should tackle it
2440648 a strange and strenuous christmas for me with plenty of snow to look at and very little ease
2440649 dinner consisted of pemmican biscuits chocolate clair pony meat plum pudding and crystallized ginger and four caramels each we none of us could hardly move
2440650 midwinter night and what a celebration it is inside the hut are orgies we are very merry and indeed why not the sun turns to come back to us tonight and such a day comes only once a year
2440651 after dinner we had to make speeches but instead of making a speech bowers brought in a wonderful christmas tree made of split bamboos and a ski stick with feathers tied to the end of each branch candles sweets preserved fruits
2440652 if you want to please me very much you will fall down when i shoot you

2440655 stone ridge resident and adventure writer jon bowermaster was aboard the national geographic endeavor one of two ships that first responded to assist the sinking cruise vessel explorer after it struck ice friday morning off the coast of antarctica the new york times reported
2440656 there was a long line of black rubber zodiac boats and a handful of orange lifeboats strung out and it was very surreal because it was a very beautiful morning with the sun glistening off the relatively calm sea
2440657 and all you could think about was how relieved these people must have been when they saw these two big ships coming
2440658 the virtual book tour thing was really cool to listen to it helped me understand better why so many of the essays in your book sound so heartbroken why there are planes taking off from the ice full of people sobbing its kind of amazing because when i got the book and started reading it the last thing i expected was stories filled with heartsick longing for a place seemingly so inhospitable to humans and the funny stories were a surprise too since i was raised on tales of scott of the antarctic and later shackleton i figured antarctica was all about noble sacrifice and freezing digits off and eating sled dogs

2440715 my career was limited because opportunities to lead were very few
2440716 ive been able to start with a clean sheet of paper and create something unique in a world class city
2440717 i came because i saw that the entire leadership of the country the fabric of the country was thirsting for biology
2440718 i want to make sure that everyone knew i was taking this seriously
2440719 rising above the gathering storm energizing and employing america for a brighter economic future
2440720 we need to give this the same focus and energy
2440721 that the next round of innovations in networking is done in india or china how many years is it before either cisco relocates to india or china and grows most of its new jobs there or the next cisco is actually created there
2440722 if the u s doesnt get its act together du pont is going to go to the countries that do and so are ibm and intel wed much rather be here but we have an obligation to our employees and shareholders to bring value where we can
2440723 to promote the progress of science to advance the national health prosperity and welfare to secure the national defense
2440724 people have this idea of academic research as this fuzzy ivory tower stuff that probably doesnt pay off
2440725 they say that because were in a war we need to have a shorter term focus
2440726 laid the technology the underlying vocabulary of the internet they were doing fundamental important long term research
2440727 unless theres an emotional appeal basic research is well beyond the time span of the next election
2440728 there is a very emotional attachment to research on cancer or chronic illnesses its much more difficult to say what will the structure of the transistor look like in the next 15 years
2440729 if we compare what our best undergraduates get paid as a graduate student vs what they get paid in investment banking theres no doubt that theres tremendous economic pressure to suck you away from what is perhaps your first academic love
2440730 they love the fact that science majors can think analytically that were comfortable with numbers
2440731 there are no guarantees if you go into science especially as a woman you have to worry about getting tenure or if you go into industry it takes you a long time to work your way up the ladder
2440732 by the time your roommate is out of grad school youve been promoted plus youre making a lot more money while theyre stuck in lab
2440733 its marketed as i dont want to say dead end but sort of o k heres your role heres your lab heres what youre going to be working on even if its a really cool product youre locked into it
2440734 if youre an m i t grad and youre going to get paid 50 000 to work in a cubicle all day as opposed to 60 000 in a team setting plus a bonus plus this plus that it seems like a no brainer
2440735 we dont have this shadow of sputnik or the cold war overhanging us
2440736 we have a different kind of war an economic war
2440737 the importance of investing in long term research for winning that war hasnt been understood
2440738 whats going on over there is amazing theres plenty of funding and a lot less bureaucracy
2440739 in the u s the state government says lets do one thing while the federal government is trying to stamp it out
2440740 before i never thought about doing research there because i needed resources but it looked to me that resources were available the whole environment was changing
2440741 ten years ago in china it was virtually all derivative stuff
2440742 students would sit and listen and try to capture every word now theyre asking lots of questions
2440743 it was totally topsy turvy can you imagine in the u s the secretary of education fawning on a nobel prizewinner it just wont happen
2440744 in china today bill gates is britney spears in america today britney spears is britney spears and that is our problem

2440791 you are aware of the huge burden imposed on our financial resources due to the continuously rising trend in global oil prices and our dependence on import of crude
2440792 we need to explain to the people the constraints and reasons that have compelled the government to introduce these measures
2440793 as we ask the people to bear some of the financial burden of our oil imports it is not only necessary from the resource conservation point of view but also as a moral duty to cut out all wasteful expenditure in our own establishments

2440898 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2440899 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2440900 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2440901 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2440902 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2440903 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2440904 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2440905 sie haben die verantwortung unsere bev lkerung zu sch tzen mit alledem befassen wir uns jetzt

2440909 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2440915 blood gushes out all over the screen as if being hosed into the camera
2440916 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2440917 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2440918 more often dealt with by more formal methods like reprimands final warnings and prosecution
2440919 oh man i wish my silly fear lasted three more seconds
2440920 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2440921 georgian armed forces fully control tskhinvali and the surrounding heights
2440922 people who are responsible for this humanitarian catastrophe should carry responsibility for what they have done
2440923 russia completely devastated the port of poti on the black sea which is a key port for the transport of energy sources from the caspian sea and is close to the baku supsa pipeline and the supsa oil terminal
2440924 russia destroys georgian port in poti civilian population at risk from russian aggression
2440925 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2440926 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2440927 will they stay sunbathing on the beach or will they give a clear signal to russia so that it does not cross certain limits
2440928 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2440929 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2440930 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2440931 this is my 16th season as a professional i think it was july 1993 when i signed as a pro
2440932 i signed a one year contract and i actually had a couple of bad injuries in that year
2440933 i ruptured my ankle ligaments and broke my thumb so maybe it was only my attitude around the place that got me the opportunity which im still grateful to kevin for
2440934 it got me the second year and its flown over to be honest
2440935 it was fascinating when it happened keegans return it was great we know what he can do to this place
2440936 people who talk about revolution and class struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life without understanding what is subversive about love and what is positive in the refusal of constraints such people have corpses in their mouths
2440937 true failure tragic and heartbreaking as it is is proof that youve reached beyond yourself that you are pushing at your own limits and the limits of the world
2440938 protesters many of whom are from muslim welfare organsation perkida and islamic party pas shouted
2440939 when those who attended the forum made their way out of the building they were greeted with loud
2440940 this type of behaviour certainly makes a mockery of the very religious principles which they claim to want to uphold
2440941 many times to storm into the building if the forum was not stopped
2440942 found two bottles of alcohol by the building that were believed to be unlit molotov cocktails
2440943 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini and shamala revisited
2440944 dont play with fire dont ever touch religious and racial matters
2440945 it is pointless to organise forums based on intellectualism professionalism or controversial issues when the safety peace harmony and stability of the country were being compromised
2440946 although pas accepts the freedom of expression of various parties to dialogue and discuss issues of public interest nevertheless issues concerning islam is something already guaranteed in the federal constitution
2440947 only confuse the real understanding of islam and cause undue tension
2440948 canada has been considered a bastion of economic stability unlike the u s the u k europe japan which are already in recession or heading that way
2440949 canada until recently has held up quite well but this jobs report is a sign that its our turn now
2440950 the u s dollar has already weakened and now the other countries are catching up
2440951 its a schizophrenic market with the attention span of a nanosecond
2440952 the clarity is just not there and it will take time for the smoke to clear
2440953 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud
2440954 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2440955 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2440956 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2440957 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2440958 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2440959 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2440960 lower oil prices are probably a good thing in the long run but its certainly given the tsx a smack upside the head
2440961 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2440962 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2440963 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2440964 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2440965 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it
2440966 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are

2440970 if we had the openers like aussies our mo batsmen would show their true colors
2440971 with the season just around the corner i am feeling a sense of optimism about what may happen although alan irvine has made only 2 signings he must feel that there are the makings of a good squad and the players are looking fitter than ever i feel that neil mellor will be influential this year and he seems up for it as he has bagged 8 goals in the play offs i think we can achieve a top 10 finish but dont rule out a trip to wembley nobody fancies us so it could be a good thing
2440972 this is the season where alan irvine would have most been looking forward to when he first decided to step up from david moyes assistant at everton last season after securing north end s championship status with an incredible turnaround in the new year he will be hoping for preston to show the same form this time around as he fixes his sights further up the league if you read the lep you will have constantly read about how fit the players are and how professionally this pre season has been run in comparison with last season apart from the everton result the signs have been promising with north end turning in some decent displays and the goal scoring form of neil mellor has also been encouraging at the time of writing the jury is out amongst fans on how well the team will do with preston only making 2 summer signings so far and being priced at 40 1 by bookmakers to gain promotion one thing they will need to do this time around is to reverse previous sluggish starts and get off to a much better one early victories in the season can set a team up throughout the remainder of the season you only have to look at bristol city and we in the 2000 01 season to see what can be achieved from starting off well at the time of writing preston still need another centre half as cover and also a striker these two positions need to be filled if preston is to progress this term irvine has publicly admitted his interest in victor anichebe from everton on loan if he and a defender can be signed then it could be an interesting season down at deepdale whatever happens it will be another rollercoaster with hopefully more ups and less downs
2440973 i had thought about it i planned it all out in my head and when it got to that first end i stepped on the line and my arms were like jelly
2440974 beforehand i felt quite calm and quite cool and then physically i just got that adrenaline rush my first four ends were just a huge rollercoaster of emotion
2440975 it was a weird feeling i was so happy to be shooting but so frustrated that i wasnt shooting well
2440976 women of wellington learn more about islam and have fun too
2440977 this is great opportunity for women to talk with some of their fellow wellingtonians whom they might not ordinarily meet and learn more about other cultures in a light hearted atmosphere
2440978 some of the women from the wellington mosque have graciously agreed to be our fashion models and show the women of wellington their culture religion and favourite outfits
2440979 because islamic fashion is something of a new sight on wellington streets it can sometimes be viewed as a barrier

2440997 officers are investigating this matter in conjunction with west midlands police to determine if any criminal offences have been committed
2440998 it has proved to be a complex lengthy investigation which is still ongoing
2440999 we have been able to offer a limited amount of help to walsall residents who have lost their money due to the business having ceased trading however officers are pursuing all available routes of enquiry
2441000 the college was run as a private business and as such was not regulated by walsall council
2441001 many projects have taken place in wards without the consultation and participation of ward members and without accountability to the local communities through the ward structures
2441002 how will the existing structures which bring transparency and accountability be utilised in any planning for this programme
2441003 the way its being spent should be discussed in public it should all be transparent
2441004 he is somebody who doesnt want dialogue he wants to close down dialogue
2441005 some officers dont seem to realise that their job is to act in accordance with what councillors want not the other way around
2441006 the real issue here is that councillors are the elected representatives of the people and we have the contacts and the knowledge
2441007 quality is our compass and were going to continue to steer by it because thats who we are and thats who we are in the marketplace and i think customers know that and appreciate it
2441008 were not going to just start selling price items thats not who we are but we are clearly offering the value items if thats the choice that you want to make
2441009 im in favor of leaving the status quo the way it is
2441010 a desk is a dangerous place from which to view the world
2441011 its a rare person who wants to hear what he doesnt want to hear
2441012 whatever you do in life surround yourself with smart people wholl argue with you
2441013 the problem with communication is the illusion that it has been accomplished
2441014 no pessimist ever discovered the secret of the stars or sailed to an uncharted land
2441015 dude you guys i think i went to elementary school with that girl
2441016 the screen is better because making it smaller makes images crisper
2441017 liberi di conciliare lalternative dispute resolution in italia situazione attuale e proposte di riforme
2441018 il fallimento del sistema giudiziario monolitico e statocentrico sotto gli occhi di tutti per questo urgente come rileva bozzi nel suo studio che il legislatore italiano tolga ogni ostacolo allo sviluppo della mediazione e dellarbitrato che in altri paesi rappresentano da tempo unimportante componente del sistema giudiziario e che in italia invece faticano a crescere e a trovare spazio
2441019 far ottenere la restituzione delle somme di denaro pagate in pi a causa del mancato adeguamento del prezzo della benzina
2441020 non si capisce come si possa annunciare qualcosa che non esiste lingresso in vigore della norma che crea la class action stato rimandato a gennaio e verosimilmente essa subir cambiamenti che speriamo essere sostanziali a oggi nessuno sa come tale istituto sar disciplinato
2441021 quindi nessuno pu mettersi a sindacare sui livelli fissati dalle compagnie tanto pi che almeno da quando lautorit antitrust ha accettato gli impegni presentati dalle compagnie per far venir meno le accuse di cartello bisogna presumere che non vi siano violazioni delle norme sulla concorrenza i consumatori non dovrebbero essere protetti dalle compagnie petrolifere conclude ma da chi dice di difenderli e assieme si fa interprete del peggior populismo
2441022 oh this guy would probably not beat me up because theres alot of people around
2441023 oh sir youre drinking an rm10 cup of coffee why not spare a few bucks
2441024 cos honestly right using a condom is like fucking a plastic bag
2441025 whichever guy who drives an atos i dont want to make friends with him its a girls car
2441026 fucking screwed up spoilt brats thats why you call them brats anyway
2441027 that girls face is what you call a rain collector
2441028 so in the mean time i thank god for giving me a strong arm and useful hands
2441029 why do you keep your music scores in the toilet
2441030 theyre fucking slow i gave up on nikon a few months ago the digital stuff asyraf
2441031 i look more like my dad and hes very pretty
2441032 well guys will always talk about their girlfriends girls will only talk about their boyfriends when they do something wrong
2441033 if theres indeed god in this world he surely is an odd bastard
2441034 we should do this more often butching about people we barely know
2441035 i want people to blog not for money but because they want to
2441036 he planned my birthday celebration a whole day out with him like mummy and a little son going to the playground
2441037 celebrity bloggers thats just plain crap and youngsters thinking that these people are like their idols
2441038 righteous people are plain rude and should shut the fuck up
2441039 new year 15 days you ought to stop saying wtf lo
2441040 if the wii is open source you can design a tfk game
2441041 this is the reason why i still ask the cousins to meet up this is why i still risk rejection and this is why i continue to hope
2441042 this is a powerful message for li ning the company
2441043 simon king is a central defender who shouldnt be at this level simple as that hes way above it
2441044 we have strikers in simeon jackson and mark mccammon who wouldnt look out of place in league one or the championship
2441045 we have got the individuals its just we have to make every game like leeds united away last year in front of 40 000 people it was a great buzz because its where you want to play we have to go to accrington or dagenham in front of maybe 1 800 and do the same
2441046 like 10 or 12 others we want to be in amongst it
2441047 promotion s not a must but its something we want to achieve if we didnt we would all be disappointed but its such a long season with so many twists and turns you just dont know
2441048 you are always judged from the first game but now i have been given a bit of time over the close season to work with people more and move a couple out you will see more of my team than it was in november
2441049 at the back end of the season we showed a little bit of what im about hard work and trying to get it across to the supporters that it means everything to play for this club hopefully we play with the same desire but create more chances this year
2441050 dislike going away because foreigners dont want to speak english
2441051 beyond dispute one of the finest and noblest in the world
2441052 of those accustomed to dainty living to the point of eating fish and meat at one meal
2441053 is the endless procession of barges thronged with pleasure seekers their minds and thoughts intent upon nothing but bodily pleasures and the delights of society
2441054 madrid is filled with a lot of free thinking individuals
2441055 its a remarkable eclectic mix there are writers artists musicians and engineers and a lot of europeans are coming to settle
2441056 madrid is sort of a poorer cousin a rougher edged diamond

2441059 kupermans book marks the beginning of an entirely new genre the eco teen romance
2441060 the germany coach has always made it clear that purely performances play a role in his choice
2441061 i have every faith in joachim low and will do everything with my performances on the pitch to convince him that i can be of help in filling the goalkeeper position
2441062 i think that gaining experience in europe is important and you only get that when you regularly play on tuesdays wednesdays or thursdays
2441063 my challenge this season is not only to stay fit but to make my way into the team again
2441064 thats going to be difficult because of the way wes performed and also owen hargreaves and john oshea in the right back position
2441065 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic but i have never been afraid of a challenge and i dont see it as a pressure or a burden it is exciting and a fantastic incentive
2441066 harry redknapp has done a fantastic job getting the players that he has brought in
2441067 winning the fa cup was a great achievement and they can only push on from there
2441068 you really are talking about a side with great strength and ability
2441069 portsmouth are very difficult to beat with their physical strength and mixed in with that they have some hugely skilful players
2441070 its free its not free its free its kind of free
2441071 while 99 is where we are at now we are constantly re evaluating pricing and licensing so it is never final nor is it set in stone that custom fields will remain a paid feature for ever
2441072 for system objects in movable type entries categories and blogs as a result readers will first need to
2441073 kupermans book marks the beginning of an entirely new genre the eco teen romance
2441074 its stunning that if he had actually won the democratic nomination and this story had broken he would have basically blown the democrats chance of retaining the of getting the white house
2441075 what is remarkable is just the logical his thoughts the way he thought this out because its not as if he was already running and had an affair he had an affair and and then decided he could still run for president and that this would not emerge
2441076 it doesnt have to be on maury povich i mean do you see this as some sort of public event or you know maury povich seems like every episode theyre taking a paternity test
2441077 theres something wrong with your head when youre caught in a sex scandal and you use phrases like ive been stripped bare
2441078 but he didnt order that anybody be tortured he didnt violate the geneva convention he didnt water board him he didnt order the cia to falsify documents to lead us into a war
2441079 hes improved a lot and today hes a very good player
2441080 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2441081 he gets in and out of his rhythm every now and then but hes starting to get a lot of results out of his work with pitching coach dan warthen and the guys in the bullpen
2441082 i felt good going back out there for the second inning
2441083 its always disappointing but its my first bad outing in a long time since the all star break
2441084 i felt like i made some good pitches and got out of the second inning i am not too upset about it you move on and i have already done that i am not going to look too much into it
2441085 he is in the rotation he has to find a way to get better
2441086 the only time you are truly comfortable is when most of your roster has proven track records
2441087 i understand weve been having problems with the bullpen but i didnt think about that i just thought about the days game and what i had to do i was making my pitches
2441088 hes been good for a long period of time really
2441089 it just so happens now that theyre all big games and he does seem to rise to that
2441090 aaron has everything it takes to get us through this period of wagner being out
2441091 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2441092 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2441093 when youre playing with a legend you cant help but feed off that theres been guys with smiling faces around here since favre was acquired i just cant wait to get him on the field
2441094 i think hell fit right in it didnt take me long to adjust im just a small town country boy brett comes from the same background hell fit in great with these guys
2441095 we were trying to get a head start on the playbook
2441096 brett only has really three weeks to get ready kellen was there to tell him a couple of plays and while he was calling the plays out i was translating it from the green bay offense its the same type of system its just worded differently
2441097 you always question when youre going from one place to another you never know how guys are going to react to you in the huddle and i had a good experience out there
2441098 were pleased with the two players who competed if progress continues well be solid in the backup position
2441099 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2441100 he wants to play for the yankees so he can get at the red sox
2441101 you guys in the media didnt but i did with the way the test went i figured this would be the outcome i cant wait to get back out there
2441102 i just remember there was a chase scene in the forest
2441103 no i mean as if you were pitching this for television
2441104 i know exactly what you meant i have no desire to see this on tv
2441105 look for me comics are the goal in and of itself i dont want to option this for tv or film
2441106 ill bring these back to the nickelodeon development people and see what they think
2441107 you see it was the only workers i could get
2441108 i just went on the field for the first time
2441109 i had to drop the hammer im leaving nine each day
2441110 its a lot better but it still bothers me a little bit when i squat
2441111 i have no idea you can ask hitting coach kevin long he knows my swing better than me
2441112 i havent been taking it that hard i mean i think you just want to go up there and hit the ball have good at bats there wasnt a whole lot of that in texas well see new series new at bats
2441113 i dont worry because you know that its going to turn around
2441114 the most important part of the season is ahead of us
2441115 i dont know last year it was good this year not so good
2441116 the biggest thing is you want to get a good pitch to hit and hit it thats in any situation
2441117 i look at thursday he hit two balls pretty hard
2441118 he just hit them right at people my thing is when a guys struggling eventually hes going to get hot
2441119 liberty without socialism is privilege and injusitce socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality
2441120 i havent had headaches havent been sluggish and havent been feeling tired it was just getting frustrating answering questions about whats going on
2441121 brett was brought in for one reason and one reason only and thats to win on the field
2441122 they didnt ask for my opinion but im certainly glad we did it
2441123 its still incumbent on us to make the case for why this new building is going to transform the experience at the meadowlands
2441124 ill probably throw the beginning of next week everything feels fine now
2441125 you see the performance and you go ahead and visualize his further development and how he can help you as the season goes on no doubt
2441126 i was waiting for them to let me off that leash
2441127 but it felt real good just to be able to turn it loose
2441128 well have to do some discussing of that situation probably even this evening
2441129 that doesnt mean anything other than the fact that well listen to the medical advice on what they think is the length of his injury and then well talk about what his status might very well be
2441130 to throw the ball the way he did to come out in the seventh the way he did with that pitch count and keep throwing zeros up there gives the offense a lot of confidence
2441131 hes been good for a long period of time really
2441132 it just so happens now that all the games are big games and he does seem to rise to that
2441133 see how he recovers from today tomorrow if he feels good and normal stiffness and that type of thing he should be fine for his start on wednesday
2441134 ready to go on wednesday i felt no pain no soreness throw my bullpen on sunday and get ready to go on wednesday
2441135 if he came in and did well and we had to send him out thats not really good for him if he came in and didnt do well and we sent him out thats not good for him
2441136 it was very interesting to hear him say lets have a lot of fun
2441137 a guy whos been in the league that long first thing that came out of his mouth was lets have a lot of fun
2441138 most of my thoughts when he told me were about chad to be honest
2441139 hes obviously a great friend a great teammate so my thoughts initially were all about chad
2441140 im going to try and look at this in a positive way the opportunity to learn from a future hall of famer doesnt come along too often and its something i look forward to
2441141 whenever you have a hall of fame player coming in its always going to work out
2441142 as long as everyone does their job we should be all right
2441143 and thats another thing that was important to me and important to him him coming in and being just another member of the team and thats what this is about
2441144 there was a lot of smiles in here tonight because it was good to see him come here and support us tonight
2441145 with everything thats going on hes still showing up tonight being on the sidelines and cheering us on
2441146 we believe that all the prophets from adam and noah through to jesus and mohammed that all the prophets were circumcised
2441147 the old testament tells of the importance god placed on circumcision an outward sign but it also says that circumcision of the heart is more important it does not matter if you are outwardly perfect if your heart is dirty only god can change a mans heart

2441149 derawar itself is considered as pre historic and pre harappan settlement it survived not only during pre harappan period but also afterwards
2441150 the fact that it was the first settlement of indo scythian race also points to the antiquity of the place the settlement existed when alexander crossed the hakra river near derawar it was one of the important boarder posts of the caravan route and lastly was the capital of bahawalpur state abbasi rulers turned the hindu city into a perfect muslim metropolis

2441155 my family and i thought a lot about whether the movie should be released or not it would lead to their arrest and detention but dhondup considered showing it to the world very important

2441159 bi men are going to infect straight women with hiv
2441160 why do straight white men think this and how do they export their opinions to the rest of us
2441161 first off let me make a disclaimer i am not talking about all straight men here just most of them thankfully many straight men to not subscribe to the insecurities i describe here
2441162 mostly straight white male who is comfortable flirting and making out with bi guys and potentially more in the right circumstance
2441163 i wish there were a word to lump these sort of more open men under
2441164 promoted which is not different really from the narrow but real aspects of women that are promoted in heterosexual women by the sort of swm youre discussing
2441165 polyamory is accessible to the culture at large in a way that queerness is not
2441166 the point that emens make is that most people in our culture can either imagine themselves as somehow nonmonogamous or can at least see some advantages in other words they can see how someone might want multiple lovers
2441167 well it would be neat to have multiple lovers but it would never work out
2441168 wow it would be neat to have sex with members of my gender
2441169 lots more sex than i have to deal with already meh
2441170 well it would be neat to have multiple lovers but it would never work out

2441181 knowledge is information that changes something or somebody either by becoming grounds for actions or by making an individual or an institution capable of different or more effective action
2441182 knowledge is of two kinds we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information on it
2441183 you give me an idea and i give you an idea we both have two ideas you give me a dollar i giveyou a dollar we still each have one dollar
2441184 a little knowledge that acts is worth infinitely more than much knowledge that is idle
2441185 many have accused the chinese of trying to control international perceptions of tiananmen square beijings
2441186 the tanks were sent out largely to crush this workers rebellion which posed a far graver threat to the cpc than did the democracy seeking students
2441187 what took place was the slaughter not of students but of ordinary workers and residents precisely the target that the chinese government had intended
2441188 hundreds of people most of them workers and passers by did die that night but in a different place and under different circumstances

2441293 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
2441294 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
2441295 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
2441296 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
2441297 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato

2441302 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
2441303 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
2441304 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora

2441310 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
2441311 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice

2441393 to bugger young boys is just fine no no officer its not a crime
2441394 yes thats what they all say then i stick em away and i doobery doobery dime
2441395 did you just say that to get in the house
2441396 and what are we to do we turn away from matters of the flesh and we turn to things of the spirit lust has a thousand avenues the dance hall the ice cream parlour the tenement saloon the turkish bath like the hydra it grows new heads everywhere even the modern inventions of science are used to cultivate immorality the gas engine has brought us the automobile joyride and an even more pernicious menace the roadside brothel electricity has made possible the degrading picture show because of the telephone a young woman can hear the voice of her suitor on the pillow right next to her and lets not forget the most scandalous invention of all the talon slide fastener otherwise known as the zipper which provides every man and boy speedy access to moral oblivion
2441397 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the middle east e gaming development industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean
2441398 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
2441399 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
2441400 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
2441401 i love shopping for middle east e gaming development stuff online
2441402 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
2441403 and are also practically built into the internet its second nature to them unlike those in older demographics who have more money to purchase middle east e gaming development items but choose to do offline
2441404 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
2441405 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a middle east e gaming development product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
2441406 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
2441407 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy middle east e gaming development stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
2441408 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
2441409 because weve noted a huge demand for middle east e gaming development transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for middle east e gaming development companies and many others

2441415 without reality television the city of los angeles would be a pretty barren zone
2441416 with all the films moving out of los angeles television and reality television supports a lot of people who make film make television
2441417 what we needed to do is get back to playing our style of baseball
2441418 we made some huge errors and we dug ourselves into a hole
2441419 we didnt come out the gate and play defense weve got to show up tomorrow
2441420 right now knowing that were out of the playoff race and everything thats happened this season its kind of hard but you just have to have fun with your teammates and battle through it

2441423 dr barretts remarks are a reminder that we need to develop additional educational materials that address the aap recommendations in greater detail our challenge will be to present this complex message in a manner that can be adopted by the families we serve
2441424 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2441425 this is a very simple case its not a matter of reviewing thousands of text messages
2441426 i wont be the judge prosecutor doug baker wont be the judge and we wont be the jurors

2441429 oil drives the price of gasoline which drives the price of ethanol the price of ethanol is a very high factor in the price of corn
2441430 if soy corn and wheat are making more money the farmer might chose to grow less of other things because he can use the same ground to plant more profitable products
2441431 if its fear or a code of silence or the lack of protection and safety that keeps someone from telling what they know the unfortunate truth is justice is not served and were all to blame for a community thats losing its ability and acts as if its powerless
2441432 we clearly have too many teenagers and young adults who are making terrible choices but quite frankly the really bad choices are made by adults
2441433 what we see going on with our children is a reflection of who we are as adults
2441434 we cant make excuses for them or blame other factors or influences they are who we have taught them to be
2441435 whenever theres a tragedy in our community its a crisis but the more i thought about it the crisis doesnt happen when the crime takes place
2441436 most importantly the crisis takes place when the children grow up without being given a strong set of values that lead them to be a loving and caring person
2441437 im frustrated as ive worked over these years and been involved in fame and many other efforts im frustrated but i dont feel hopeless and i dont feel helpless i know that we dont have to be a community that lives in fear
2441438 this has been 10 years that i have really dedicated myself to keeping the unsolved murders victims memories alive i just wouldnt stop i didnt really mean to do this for 10 years but it was in me and i kept driving and driving i thank you for being patient with me

2441447 i have been coming for 28 years and i have never seen anything like this we have had wet lowthers but nothing as bad as this
2441448 having said that everybody is on the site and all the events are happening as on the timetable it is a country show and it does sometimes rain in england
2441449 it has been good we got in about 9am and weve seen all the stands the dressage and the kids tried some local produce
2441450 its fantastic this will help preserve the cumberland sausage and make sure poor quality imitations cant use the name
2441451 its high time the cumberland sausage was celebrated for the fantastic product it is
2441452 it is part of our culinary heritage and it is right that it is not sullied by poor imitations made outside the county
2441453 before the protected status idea came up anybody could make a sausage and call it cumberland some of the imitations are very poor and harm the brand
2441454 some dont have a very high pork meat content and some have even been made in links rather than the traditional round
2441455 one of the greatest things is how the sausage changes around the county so in maryport it tastes more peppery while in westmorland more sage is added and in carlisle there may be more of a nutmeg taste
2441456 its about time the real cumberland sausage makers here in cumbria were acknowledged celebrated and protected
2441457 traditional cumberland sausage has been part of my life since i was a kid
2441458 if you go down south every bodys got it on the menu but its not cumberland sausage its a washed out affair

2441461 i started doing a lot of my own research and realized that in our seattle climate this geothermal is the most reliable renewable energy source

2441464 teams such as germany the netherlands and spain are all quality teams who along with a number of other countries are all capable of winning gold at beijing
2441465 no one wanted to see india out of the olympics but the reality is that the best 12 nations have qualified for beijing

2441474 i was always dreaming about the things i wanted to do when i was older like acting i still dont know why or how i passed because i literally put no time in
2441475 i was good at school but i was surprised because i didnt put too much time in
2441476 studies have found that employees of not for profit organizations and charities are often more highly motivated than employees of for profit corporations to perform well at work when their performance is not being monitored or evaluated interviews with employees of not for profit organizations suggest that the reason for their greater motivation is the belief that their work helps to improve society because they believe in the importance of their work they have personal reasons to perform well even when no financial reward is present thus if our corporation began donating a significant portion of its profits to humanitarian causes our employees motivation and productivity would increase substantially and our overall profits would increase as well
2441477 in order to effectively reduce the amount of environmental damage that industrial manufacturing plants cause those who manage the plants must be aware of the specific amount and types of damage caused by each of their various manufacturing processes however few corporations have enough financial incentive to monitor this information in order to guarantee that corporations reduce the damage caused by their plants the federal government should require every corporation to produce detailed annual reports on the environmental impact of their manufacturing process and the government should impose stiff financial penalties for failure to produce these reports
2441478 the more efficient a firms employees are the more profitable that firm will be improvements in a firms information technology hardware and software are a proven way to increase the efficiency of employees who do the majority of their work on computers therefore if our firm invests in the most powerful and advanced information technology available employee productivity will be maximized this strategy ensures that every dollar spent on enhanced information technology will help to increase our firms profit margins
2441479 after experiencing a decline in usage by its members healthy heart fitness center built an indoor pool since usage did not increase significantly it appears that health club managers should adopt another approach lowering membership fees rather than installing expensive new features
2441480 eight years ago our firms profits were increasing with each new employee we added we discovered that each employee had the skills and motivation to generate more revenue for the firm than his or her salary cost us however for the past two years our profit margin has been falling even though we have continued to add employees thus our newer employees are not generating enough revenue to justify their salaries we must not be hiring new employees with the same level of skills and motivation as those we used to attract clearly then failures in the human resources department account for our falling profits
2441481 since our company started manufacturing and marketing a deluxe air filter six months ago sales of our economy filter and company profits have decreased significantly the deluxe air filter sells for 50 percent more than the economy filter but the economy filter lasts for only one month while the deluxe filter can be used for two months before it must be replaced to increase repeat sales of our economy filter and maximize profits we should discontinue the deluxe air filter and concentrate all our advertising efforts on the economy filter
2441482 the tragic crash of a medical helicopter last week points up a situation that needs to be addressed the medical helicopter industry supposedly has more stringent guidelines for training pilots and maintaining equipment than do most other airline industries but these guidelines do not appear to be working statistics reveal that the rate of medical helicopter accidents is much higher than the rate of accidents for non medical helicopters or commercial airliners
2441483 commercial real estate prices have been rising steadily in the sandida heights neighborhood for several years while the prices in the adjacent neighborhood of palm grove have remained the same it seems obvious then that a retail space in sandida heights must now be much more expensive than a similar space in palm grove which was not the case several years ago so it appears that retail spaces in sandida heights are now overpriced relative to those in palm grove therefore it would be in our financial interest to purchase a retail space in palm grove rather than in sandida heights
2441484 the computerized onboard warning system that will be installed in commercial airliners will virtually solve the problem of midair plane collisions one planes warning system can receive signals from anothers transponder a radio set that signals a planes course in order to determine the likelihood of a collision and recommend evasive action
2441485 our factory in cookville is our most advanced and efficient it is capable of producing ten drill bits for each dollar of production costs whereas none of our other factories can produce more than seven drill bits per dollar of production costs therefore we can reduce our overall drill bit production costs by devoting the cookville factory entirely to drill bit production since reducing the production costs of individual machine parts is the only way to achieve our larger goal of reducing our overall production costs dedicating the cookville factory entirely to drill bit production and shifting all other machine part production to our other factories will help us to attain that larger goal
2441486 currently more professional accountants use smartpro accounting software than any other brand however in the market for personal accounting software for non professionals to use in preparing their income tax returns many of our competitors are outselling us in surveys our professional customers repeatedly say that they have chosen smartpro software because our most sophisticated software products include more advanced special features than competing brands therefore the most effective way for us to increase sales of our personal accounting software for home users would clearly be to add the advanced special features that our professional software products currently offer
2441487 over the past two years pageturners profits have decreased by 5 percent even though we have added a popular caf as well as a music section selling cds and tapes at the same time we have experienced an increase in the theft of merchandise we should therefore follow the example of thoreau books which increased its profits after putting copies of its most frequently stolen books on a high shelf behind the payment counter by doing likewise with copies of the titles that our staff reported stolen last year we too can increase profitability
2441488 our city councils neglect of the impoverished railroad flats neighborhood has left businesses with little incentive to locate there building a new professional football stadium in the neighborhood would solve this problem thousands of football fans would travel to the area to see games and they would buy from local merchants encouraging new businesses to open so our city council should move quickly to fund the construction of a professional football stadium in railroad flats in order to help the neighborhood develop a thriving economy
2441489 our huggybunny brand is the bestselling brand of childrens clothing parents everywhere recognize the huggybunny logo as a mark of quality and most of our customers show great brand loyalty sales reports have shown that parents are more likely to buy childrens clothes with the familiar huggybunny brand and logo than otherwise identical clothes without it therefore if we use the huggybunny brand name and logo for the new line of clothing for teenagers that our company will soon be introducing that clothing will sell better than it would if we labeled it with a new brand name and logo

2441494 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 00 p m and 11 39 p m on friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
2441495 under such a weather condition a small bubble in the rain cloud would have triggered rainfall let alone a lightening
2441496 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right

2441506 while we have stayed away from that enquirer report because we couldnt confirm it this strikes us as a legitimate story that on the record dems including a former edwards campaign manager are criticizing edwards decision to stay mum on the topic and saying it might affect his credibility enough that he wouldnt get a speaking slot at the convention

2441513 but it gets you moving and thats the main thing
2441514 as you get to be 71 balance is the first thing in my opinion that begins to go
2441515 were seeing a rash of falls all over the united states on the first step
2441516 when you do fall you will slump and you wont get hurt
2441517 if you do these things your body automatically remembers them and when you go to fall this will happen
2441518 ill practise on saturday and will see on sunday how everything goes

2441524 the drivers want to emphasize that its the guys on the aim crew who make this program work
2441525 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2441526 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with
2441527 while his victory in the 1969 open at the champions was a surprise orvilles superb ball striking talents were thankfully showcased over the next quarter century both on the regular and senior tour
2441528 the expression he could golf his ball certainly applied to orville
2441529 our offence has been doing a great job driving the ball down the field and putting it in the end zone and those times that we dont get into the end zone its my job to come out and put it through the uprights
2441530 bryan is starting to think about possibly getting his career started somewhere else
2441531 well leave him alone hes going to get back to us in a couple of weeks theres not going to be any issues im really confidant its going to be resolved amicably before training camp
2441532 hes working out off the ice and hes supposed to start on the ice the beginning of the week
2441533 we will certainly not sit idly by if the maple leafs take a position which is unreasonable and unfair to bryan mccabe
2441534 in our view telling him not to show up and to stay home we would view that as utterly unreasonable we would undoubtedly file a grievance and pursue that aggressively for bryan
2441535 it wont get resolved until early september but it will get resolved
2441536 i realized the pros dont hit it any farther than i do
2441537 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2441538 i dont think its going to be won by one under par
2441539 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2441540 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2441541 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2441542 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2441543 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2441544 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2441545 i dont think too many people question that i think a lot of people question what happened this off season
2441546 we need to tackle people thats a big thing for me
2441547 we need to make some adjustments in how we played its amazing we played so well a week ago in defeating winnipeg 19 11 and then five days later play as badly as we played
2441548 we missed so many tackles on defence and we dropped passes and missed people that were open on offence we need to do better
2441549 we have good players we have enough players here we have 10 kids on defence that arent starting those kids know what were doing
2441550 any coach that goes out and recruits 10 new guys and brings them up and plays them the next week is an idiot gone are the days of one time cfl coach george brancato being 4 14 and being in the playoffs you just cant do it that way any more
2441551 were going to try and be patient with purcey hope he learns something every time he goes out there
2441552 for me the last two games i thought he did pretty well
2441553 im watching a lot of the older guys watching their pitches that work for them and which dont
2441554 every time out i feel like im getting a little bit better
2441555 it wasnt my fastball which normally ive relied on im trying to work some other pitches over in that case it didnt help me out i made a couple of good pitches and a couple of bad pitches so thats the way it goes
2441556 we hope he becomes one of our every five day starters
2441557 when peoples salaries are high its difficult to get trades done within the league
2441558 but jeff can kick start his career because its been at a standstill
2441559 what can i say i havent got the focus this week obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2441560 i think i need to spend 24 hours in bed

2441567 he will probably be connected to the criminality of the murder of the california couple if they can find some forensic evidence and pin it on him
2441568 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2441569 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2441570 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2441571 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2441572 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2441573 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2441574 while cci welcomes mr barnetts preparedness to allow shops to open later on weeknights the same standards must also apply on sundays and for all retailers so they can better meet the needs of their customers
2441575 these types of changes will simply increase the dominance of major national retailers at the expense of independent operators and lead to reduced competition store closures and job losses
2441576 we acknowledge that he does not support wholesale deregulation and that if there is to be any change which is not our position it will be done gradually and only after extensive reference to all affected parties
2441577 he brought out santoor out of the valley of kashmir and gave it a place in the classical music scenario it is because of his inspiration that i decided to concentrate on playing the santoor
2441578 it was called shata tantri veena in the earlier times or the veena of 100 strings it was an accompaniment to a specific type of singing called sufiana mausiqui with the persian influence it got its present name santoor
2441579 it might have traveled with the gypsies to these countries
2441580 the mood is very positive people are saying they want to keep the territory on track

2441582 therell have to be a full moon and some bizarre turnaround for this to become a political contest
2441583 if they do badly at this election there may well be an outbreak of a central australian party and that would threaten the clp
2441584 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians

2441588 its exactly what theyll say they want if you ask them
2441589 come on friend lets go in forget the other people
2441590 why whats inside that door is it better than what weve got right here
2441591 why not just see whats inside the door if its so terrible you can come back out

2441666 my father died on wednesday i had so very much wished that he might live a few years longer and i look upon his death as the last sacrifice which he made to his love for me he died for me in order that if possible i might still turn into something of all that i have inherited from him the recollection of him his transfigured portrait is dearest to me and i will be careful to preserve his memory safely hidden from the world
2441667 thou sovereign of my heart treasured in the deepest fastness of my chest in the fullness of my thought there unknown divinity oh can i really believe the poets tales that when one first sees the object of ones love one imagines one has seen her long ago that all love like all knowledge is remembrance that love too has its prophecies in the individual it seems to me that i should have to possess the beauty of all girls in order to draw out a beauty equal to yours that i should have to circumnavigate the world in order to find the place i lack and which the deepest mystery of my whole being points towards and at the next moment you are so near to me filling my spirit so powerfully that i am transfigured for myself and feel that its good to be here

2441670 s ren kierkegaard dialectical result of a literary police action
2441671 the days of my authorship are past god be praised i have been granted the satisfaction of bringing it to a conclusion myself understanding when it is fitting that i should make an end and next after the publication of either or i thank god for that that this once again is not how people would see it that i could actually prove in two words that it is so i know quite well and find my authorship quite in order but it has pained me it seemed to me that i might have asked for that admission but let it be if only i can manage to become a priest however much of my present life may have satisfied me i shall breathe more freely in that quiet activity allowing myself an occasional literary work in my free time

2441676 adorno is far away from the more credible translations and interpretations of the collected works of kierkegaard we have today

2441678 the problem comes as soon as abraham wants to be understood

2441685 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

2441848 die kolleginnen und kollegen aus technik produktion und redaktion haben angesichts der gr e des ereignisses und vieler schwierigkeiten im vorfeld erstklassige arbeit geleistet es freut mich sehr dass sich trotz der zeitverschiebung so viele zuschauerinnen und zuschauer bei uns im ersten ihr eigenes bild von der beeindruckenden er ffnungsfeier gemacht haben unser olympiateam hatte einen exzellenten start

2441857 the islamic council of norway has turned to the european council for fatwa for help in deciding what attitudes norwegian muslims should have towards homosexuality one of the most difficult questions that the fatwa council will now have to take a position on is whether muslims in europe should support or reject death sentence for homosexuals this question has not been clarified so far by the islamic council of norway
2441858 in the contemporary age the muslim community has been exposed to horrendous invasions and aggressive attacks one of which is the missionary invasion that aims at uprooting the muslim community altogether this invasion began its missions with the western colonialism of the muslim world and it still exercises its activities in the muslim world and among the muslim communities and minorities in non muslim countries one of its goals is to entice muslims to convert to christianity another example is the communist invasion that spread through many muslim countries in asia and europe and made every effort to put an end to islam and grow generations who know nothing about islam at all the third and most dangerous and cunning kind is the secular invasion which still plays its role in the muslim world sometimes openly and sometimes in disguise it seeks to undermine true islam and approves of the superstitious manifestations that are falsely claimed to belong to islam
2441859 major apostasy which the apostate proclaims and openly calls for in speech or writing is to be with all the more reason severely punished by the death penalty according to the majority of scholars and the apparent meaning of the prophets hadiths otherwise an nakh i and view which was built on umars attitude may be followed apostates who call for apostasy from islam have not only become disbelievers in islam but have also become enemies of islam and the muslim nation they by doing so fall under the category of those who wage war against almighty allah and his messenger and spread mischief in the land
2441860 the death penalty with regard to apostasy is to be applied only to those who proclaim their apostasy and call for others to do the same islam lays down this severe punishment in order to protect its unity and the identity of its community every community in this world has basic foundations that are to be kept inviolable such as identity loyalty and allegiance accordingly no community accepts that a member thereof changes its identity or turns his or her loyalty to its enemies they consider betrayal of ones country a serious crime and no one has ever called for giving people a right to change their loyalty from a country to another whenever they like

2441865 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2441866 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2441867 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2441868 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home

2441916 in a good sexual relationship you touch each other all the time not just in bed when you talk to your lover put your hand on his or rub his back for a few minutes when youre driving rest your hand on his thigh when couples touch each other its a way of expressing warmth and keeping that united feeling alive all touching doesnt need to lead to sex but it is a part of being physically intimate
2441917 as a rule women take longer to get sexually aroused so start by yourself before you get into bed spend 30 minutes taking a bath with candles and fondling yourself
2441918 most men like it when a woman takes the initiative why not send him an erotic e mail in very specific detail tell him how much you desire him and what youll do to him the minute he comes home if youre sending the message to his work computer make sure no one else can open his email
2441919 most men are visually oriented you might consider leaving some lights on and asking him to watch while youre performing oral sex or having intercourse or even when youre getting ready to go to bed with him if you feel self conscious about your body do this semiclothed wear one of his shirts completely unbuttoned men love it when women borrow their clothes
2441920 if you want to get your guy off orally first spend some time stimulating his body from the navel to the knees with your hair it feels great then focus your warm breath and kisses on the head of his penis and the part thats just beneath for most men the sensation is the same as if you had the entire penis in your mouth also make hand play an active part of oral sex lightly caress his testicles and stroke the shaft of his penis this helps increase the intensity of whatever youre doing with your mouth
2441921 freeze some grapes in a ziploc bag once theyre ice cold put them in your mouth then begin oral sex the temperature and sensation produced by the grapes while youre giving him oral sex is incredible you might want to try spraying your mouth with binaca or using mint flavored toothpaste right before going down on him this will give his penis a nice warm feeling
2441922 if you dont like the taste of semen at all or want to protect yourself against disease ask your man to wear a sheik elite mint flavored condom it has an amazing taste
2441923 if your partner hasnt pleasured you orally and youd like him to have a talk about it
2441924 you must believe that men find vaginal secretions to be aphrodisiacal so stop worrying about vaginal odors and get used to the fact that men get turned on when they have oral sex with a woman
2441925 if you are comfortable hold your labia open so your man has better access while giving you oral sex spreading the labia heightens the sensation and if hes down there using his hands to hold everything open they can become cramped and stiff pretty quickly this way his hands are free to pleasure you in other places
2441926 when youre manually stimulating a man try a technique i call ode to brian it may sound complicated at first but when you get into the rhythm of it your movements will just flow do the following steps alternating hands make a u shape with your fingers and thumb at the bottom of his shaft and your palm facing away from you stroke up and when you reach the head twist over the top with as much of your palm in contact with the head of the penis as possible and come down the other side then do the same with your other hand and keep on alternating hands for as long as he can last
2441927 another fabulous hand job technique is one i call the basket weave use a water based lubricant and while sitting in front of him lace your fingers together and wrap them around his penis rather than a simple up and down motion twist as you go up and down thumbs facing you you can also add a little pulsing while twisting
2441928 getting your man to masturbate while youre also fondling his penis is a huge turn on for both you and your man begin by watching a sexy video like tracy i love you or insatiable if you dont want to hunt these down at your local video store order erotic movies through the sexuality library at 800 289 8423 ask him to act out some of the moves in the movie
2441929 to help him best delight you with his hands provide lots of coaching and be patient one thing a woman can do offer valuable feedback without saying a word wrap your hand around one of his fingers or his penis and when he does something you particularly like give a squeeze if youre not comfortable actually telling him this type of nonverbal feedback can be so helpful to a guy whos doing his best to please you
2441930 when your partner is masturbating you ask him to tug playfully on your pubic hairs this adds a slight feeling of tension that turns on many women
2441931 use pillows slip one under your hips so that during missionary position intercourse theres less opportunity for him to slip out plus when hes performing oral sex on you his neck wont get so cramped you can prop up his head and lower back with pillows so he has a better view while youre down between his legs
2441932 heres a tip to make yours and his orgasms more intense plus help each of you last longer before exploding he has to be aware of what youre going to do before either of you orgasm stop intercourse or touching yourselves directly and switch gears you might pull away and give each other a massage for a few minutes then you can resume keep bringing yourselves close to orgasm building to that peak so that by the time you do finally climax your orgasms will be all the more explosive
2441933 use each piece of furniture for a different sexual act or position have sex under the piano on a chair and in front of a window over the course of a relationship you will have created sexual memories which means your home will be a more eroticized environment
2441934 live in the surprise of the moment you never know when youre going to feel that special intimacy that is so connected to deep and wonderful sex you may both be sick and shuffling around pale and sniffly but then you give each other a passing kiss and suddenly it turns into a soulful kiss and before you know it youve got the bathrobes off and youre down on the floor that moment cant be planned so when passion hits go with it dont let practicalities get in the way
2441935 a new soft manual toothbrush is an incredible sex toy that will provide pleasure for both of you ask your man to run the bristles over your breasts and entire body the sensation is truly erotic he should brush gently around your vaginal area especially the opening then you can stimulate his body try focusing on his nipples although most men dont say it and many dont even know it the nipples are usually very sensitive a secret erogenous zone
2441936 use a vibrator good vibrations most popular is the hitachi magic wand 45 to order call 800 289 8423 a foot long dildo with a tennis ball size head thats used on the outside of your vagina couples like it because its great for foreplay gives a wonderful massage plus you can incorporate it into lovemaking during intercourse in the face to face position the wand fits nicely between two bodies a man can enjoy the indirect vibration when hes inside you while youre using the wand to stimulate your clitoris
2441937 wear a long strand of pearls knotted around your neck almost every man finds pearls supersexy seductively untie and remove them gently run the pearls over your mans entire body start with his head and face and work your way down to his toes but avoid his penis saving it for last when you finally get there wrap the pearls around his penis and sort of roll the individual pearls around and press them on his skin this unique feeling stimulation is a major turn on
2441938 good sex is sex thats always different to make things interesting use different products during foreplay bring chocolate body paint to bed order from seasons 800 776 9677 and apply it all over each other use a feather duster to apply honey dust available at any sex shop to various body parts then lick it off
2441939 everyone has secret sexual fantasies that they dont reveal even to their partner heres one way to share them both of you write three fantasies on a piece of paper and number them from 1 to 6 toss a die and pick whichever number comes up with the promise youll act it out he may want you to shave your pubic hair or go to the supermarket wearing nothing but a raincoat you may want him to have sex with you in the shower or tie you up youre both on your honor to do whatever
2441940 call him even if hes in the same house and have great phone sex the safety of not looking each other in the eye allows both of you to tell each other things you might be embarrassed to say when youre face to face when you get him on the line tell him how hot youre getting just thinking about his penis hearing someone describe how she or he is feeling and reacting is a huge turn on

2441979 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2441980 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2441981 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2441982 vor der em gingen die berlegungen eindeutig in die richtung dass ich aufh re da deutete alles darauf hin dass ich sicher und endg ltig aufh ren werde habe ich aber nie gesagt
2441983 nat rlich wollte ich nicht mit einem derartigen misserfolg aufh ren das war sicher ein argument
2441984 viele viele fans sind auf mich zugegangen und wollten dass ich weitermache hundert prozent der leute wollten das so viel anerkennung freut einen nat rlich und im grunde liebt jeder sein land und m chte f r sein land spielen
2441985 hoffentlich geht es f r uns so weiter aber selbstl ufer wird das ganz sicher keiner
2441986 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2441987 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2441988 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2441989 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2441990 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2441991 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2441992 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2441993 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2441994 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2441995 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2441996 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2441997 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2441998 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2441999 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2442000 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2442001 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2442002 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project
2442003 seit monaten haben beobachter vermutet dass moskaus prokovationen in georgien den zweck hatten einen krieg im kaukasus auszul sen nun sieht es so aus als h tte russland bekommen was es wollte georgien repr sentiert genau das was moskau an seiner grenze nicht sehen will ein land das sowohl unabh ngig als auch zusehends demokratisch ist moskau sucht stattdessen unterwerfung vorzugsweise unter autokratische herrscher die es manipulieren kann
2442004 mit seiner entscheidung s dossetien zu befreien oder wie er sagte die verfassungsordnung wiederherzustellen hat der georgische pr sident saakaschwili einen riesigen fehler begangen wie fr her slobodan milosevic hat er nicht begriffen dass sein land nur zwischen dem abschied von den abtr nnigen republiken abchasien und s dossetien und dem zerfall des landes infolge blutiger konflikte w hlen kann wahrscheinlich hat georgiens pr sident listig darauf gesetzt dass am freitag als die olympischen spiele begannen russland neutral bleiben w rde das erwies sich als naiv weil moskau eine solche gelegenheit niemals verpassen w rde saakaschwili ein politiker auf den der westen und polen gesetzt hatten wird eher fr her als sp ter f r seinen fehler bezahlen
2442005 gelingt es nicht die waffenruhe von 1992 wieder herzustellen droht ein balkan szenario die s dosseten w rden eher nach russland abwandern als die georgische oberhoheit anzuerkennen
2442006 der georgische pr sident michail saakaschwili stemmt sich gegen die einsch chterungsversuche der russen und setzt auf die hilfe westlicher l nder doch er macht sich illusionen die nato wird kaum einen krieg gegen russland riskieren um georgien zu retten jetzt muss die eu unter franz sischem vorsitz die initiative wieder ergreifen um zu verhindern dass die beziehungen zu russland sich unwiederbringlich verschlechtern
2442007 michail saakaschwili hat in einem seiner ruhigen augenblicke s dossetien die autonomie innerhalb georgiens angeboten dies muss die grundlage dringender diplomatischer bem hungen sein um beide seiten vom abgrund zur ckzuziehen
2442008 zu lange haben die beteiligten akteure am pulverfass kaukasus gez ndelt jetzt ist es explodiert irgendwann h tte ein kluger kopf stopp sagen m ssen aber keiner tat es die russen verhinderten st rrisch jede l sung des konflikts die usa ihrerseits haben den georgischen pr sidenten saakaschwili bedenkenlos unterst tzt mit waffen mit experten und mit internationaler r ckendeckung doch nun hat sich der georgische zauberlehrling selbstst ndig gemacht und einen krieg vom zaun gebrochen in seiner selbstverblendung hoffte saakaschwili wohl auf einen schnellen sieg er hat sich verrechnet
2442009 es ist zweifelhaft aber nicht undenkbar dass russland die eroberung ganz georgiens plant

2442031 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank

2442058 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2442059 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right or the passengers side where it came to rest
2442060 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2442061 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2442062 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2442063 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2442064 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep

2442183 i feel very strongly that every child when a decision like this is being made needs independent representation
2442184 whether the child shows up in court and says something or not is a separate question
2442185 i want them empowered but i would also like to protect them from saying things they dont want to say i want them to have a voice but i dont want to force them to participate in the court process which is intimidating often adversarial and may well not be good for a child to participate in
2442186 had katelynn been brought to court and had a chance to speak to duty council or a dedicated child staff lawyer
2442187 it is their life and i want us to live in a world that recognizes that it is the child that is living the life and the child needs to be heard from
2442188 a thorough investigation of a proposed caregivers background should be a key requirement in all child custody cases
2442189 this is a mandated and automatic part of the placement process employed by a childrens aid society in order to ensure a childs safety and best interests
2442190 it should be covered by the state as part of societys responsibility to children
2442191 if you dont roll up the information if you dont pull together all the recommendations and all the materials from all of the inquests and begin to look at trends gaps in service and begin to look at recommending different policy and different practice then you only get a momentary look at one child
2442192 as it stands now there is no capacity for follow up and you need to be able to follow up
2442193 weve moved out the child and youth worker weve moved out the social worker weve moved out psychology and we have just the bare bones
2442194 we need to get so much strength for the first time

2442197 coluccio had lived happily in canada thanks to the support provided by the calabrian clans a situation that shows the extraordinary reach of the ndrangheta
2442198 canada is the right place to deal with narcotics montreal is the main port of entrance for narcotics in north america and in canada they can control that major point of entry toronto specifically is an important base for ndrangheta

2442202 my name is mario lopez and im here to help you achieve the best shape of your life in as short a time as possible and then stay fit for a really really long time like the rest of your life which will last longer as a result of the workout youre about to follow
2442203 if youre not having fun youll never stick with it thats marios rule of fitness
2442204 it gets you out of the gym to prevent boredom and getting stale with your workouts
2442205 from the books cover it seems like only guys could do this program
2442206 but having the woman performing exercises as well makes it seem suitable for everyone of all levels and ages
2442207 i would recommend this book its suitable for all levels and fitness goals and promotes an overall balanced workout
2442208 het gaat niet om bijgeloof of zo maar ik wil gewoon geen twee dagen liggen nadenken over die eerste kamp trouwens de loting speelt geen rol als je de beste wil zijn moet je toch iedereen aankunnen
2442209 ik begin maandag met de gedachte om goud te behalen een medaille op mijn eerste spelen zou natuurlijk heel goed zijn maar achteraf zien we wel of ik tevreden kan zijn met wat ik gedaan heb belangrijk is momenteel om relaxed te blijven en dat lukt me heel goed het olympisch dorp doet me eigenlijk niet veel en omdat ik mijn loting niet wil weten lees ik ook geen kranten
2442210 in mijn categorie is er niet echt iemand die er fel bovenuit steekt
2442211 er zijn er heel veel die kans maken mijn klasse is de zwaarste die er is gewoon omdat de gemiddelde man ongeveer 73 kg weegt en er dus heel veel judokas in die categorie uitkomen maar dat speelt geen rol je moet eerst en vooral zelf goed zijn en ik ben er klaar voor ik voel dat ik nog progressie gemaakt heb in vergelijking met vorig jaar zowel qua kracht als techniek
2442212 de loting kon natuurlijk beter scapin is een heel zware klant
2442213 maar je hebt niet te kiezen en als je het podium wil halen moet je toch iedereen voorbij scapin is technisch heel sterk en heeft al meer tegen mij gewonnen dan omgekeerd maar judo is een rare sport en je zal nooit tien keer op tien eenzelfde judoka verslaan
2442214 ik heb alvast het goede gevoel te pakken en hopelijk kan ik dat zo houden
2442215 maar het is hier wel ontzettend warm ik heb er toch last van ik probeer dus zoveel mogelijk binnen te blijven en mij zo bezig te houden

2442220 semoga saya bisa sehat dan bisa memainkan permainan terbaik saya

2442261 medical blogging is so new that medical boards schools and professionals disagree on what is acceptable critics say the blogs cross into an ethical gray area and threaten patient privacy while posing liability risks for health workers and their employers

2442505 we can weather the economic down turn by saving our liquid capital down sizing and then bursting out when things turnaround for the better
2442506 im excited about the future possibilities in our gaming in indonesia industry
2442507 because i know in the long run its all going to work out just fine
2442508 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our gaming in indonesia market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
2442509 the last thing i want to do is send people home because thats against our companys mission statement
2442510 and also because we can reallocate our human capital to work on other projects that will be beneficial while the consumer market slows down
2442511 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
2442512 simply because having too many workers becomes unproductive well let portions of our employees take time off for their families when theyre recharged and ready to tackle the demands of the gaming in indonesia consumer demand well open our doors once again in the meantime lets be cautious and not jump to conclusions
2442513 factories of old times are now being renovated to outfit extensive gaming in indonesia it infrastructure according to a recent study released by wimberly schwarzer
2442514 the thoughts of many of the old timers are shattered in the new gaming in indonesia work released by prof rohr ahlin and it is high time for new ideas

2442619 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2442620 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2442621 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2442622 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2442623 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2442624 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2442625 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2442626 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2442627 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2442628 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2442629 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2442630 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2442631 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2442632 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2442633 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2442634 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2442635 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia
2442636 this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2442637 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2442638 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory this is the worst nightmare one can encounter
2442639 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2442640 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2442641 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors people are hiding in their basements with no electricity nocommunications
2442642 i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are
2442643 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles entered south ossetia
2442644 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2442645 we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all over the country
2442646 we are in a situation of self defence against a big and mighty neighbour
2442647 we are a country of less than five million people it would be suicidal for us to provoke russia
2442648 not allowed to direct state paid employees under his authority to conduct campaign and or fundraising related work during state paid time for his personal benefit
2442649 by having state employees work for him on his campaign and or fundraising task while they were being paid by the state he obtained the benefit of free campaign work funded by the taxpayers
2442650 we joked when we got the bonuses were not idiots we figured out what it was for we all joked that we are professional fishermen now
2442651 more and more people are volunteering that i havent seen before because of the incentive structure
2442652 fyi great job by our staff this would have never been successful without your work you have given john kerry an even better opportunity to win this state one of the 5 most important states to win this year

2442664 dont be scared of me i dont bite i lick
2442665 i think we have to play to win the game on sunday and this will raise our spirits before we leave for cairo
2442666 we have to win and will certainly give it our best show
2442667 i know the fans want us to win every game but they also have to understand that this will be a game between two clubs
2442668 the opposition would also want the same win as much as we do and will also try to score and defend just like us
2442669 so it will not be easy for because we all play for the same win
2442670 at dynamos our supporters need action and once we go for 20 minutes without any excitement for them they start booing but we are now used to this
2442671 all we try to do is play good football and win and i am happy that our coaches and the players are all united
2442672 i have great respect for the dynamos because they are a big team and representing us as zimbabweans in the african champions league
2442673 yes they might have played badly on thursday against eastern lions but we will not look into that result when playing them
2442674 dynamos remain a very good side and this will be a new game for us and for them
2442675 matches are not won by domination of possession but goals
2442676 so we need to try to hit the net as soon as possible and as much as possible
2442677 it is scoring goals that matters in a game because a team can have say 75 percent of the share but lose the game while the other can have 25 percent and score to win
2442678 it was good that we finished in the top five last year and abc came up with the super 8 this year
2442679 we are humbled by qualifying and i want to thank the sponsors who have come on board when times are hard
2442680 i hope both dynamos and sundowns will give their best and allow the fans and the sponsors to get value for their money
2442681 i cannot make any comment before this game but i believe my game is not as good as it was last year
2442682 so i want to improve and hopefully surpass the achievements of last season
2442683 we should have won or at least drawn in the league game against dynamos at gwanzura had it not been for that controversial penalty
2442684 we had registered four goalkeepers at the start of the season and i had confidence in all of them
2442685 so we are not crying much over sibanda because the cover is there
2442686 nothing has been different at training except maybe the fact the we also worked on penalties in case the match has to be decided by a shootout
2442687 so training was okay and we hope for the best results
2442688 this game against highlanders is a must win for us we need to be aggressive and we cant afford to keep dropping points
2442689 i have told the players that if the team is relegated no one will leave until they get it back where they found it
2442690 they have shown a great attitude in training and i have only been in charge for two games and what i have seen gives me confidence that we can do well
2442691 i sat down with the players and asked them if they had any problems we dealt with the few concerns they had and now we dont have any problems
2442692 we have to do our best and i can rest assure the caps fc fans that this team will not be relegated
2442693 we drew one game and lost one to a mutare referee we didnt lose to eastern lions but judging from what i have seen i believe we can get a positive result
2442694 we are ready for highlanders we are trouble free and i think the only problem will be ourselves
2442695 we know what we have to do against highlanders i have heard some people say that they are not playing well but we know how they are
2442696 highlanders have a culture of winning but we dont know our culture we have to create our own culture
2442697 these boys have gone for a long time without winning bonuses and they have to make sure that they win this game
2442698 as a professional coach it was surprised when i heard that he had been fired methembe is a very good young man who was always willing to learn
2442699 he was one young man with a very open mind and he was always free to share ideas and to me he was one of the best coaches around
2442700 i wouldnt want to comment much but maybe highlanders made the decision in the best interests of the club
2442701 we really wanted to get all the three points so that we move away from the bottom of the table
2442702 i think we played well but allowed caps united to come back into the game
2442703 however for a team playing away we are happy with the point and this builds confidence since we had been losing all along
2442704 our first half was so poor but we improved in the second period
2442705 the players are good and want to win but sometimes they are failing to handle this pressure and end up feeling the temperature during the match
2442706 we have found a photo in which el arjoune the referee was spotted meeting with etoile vice president jalel krifa in paris
2442707 once we receive the photo we will send it to caf to launch their investigations and find out the truth behind what happened in the champions league final
2442708 we will probably swerve the ebor and go to the irish st leger because if he won in the ebor he would go extremely high in the weights which compromise his chance in melbourne

2442737 its been a lot of fun working with some young athletes
2442738 i felt the people who had the biggest influence on me were my coaches so its been an honourable profession and an honourable thing to do
2442739 you really dont know if youre going to a tournament until the last minute
2442740 funding is a big big big issue its just a general state of uncertainty
2442741 we do have wrestling mats though which is the main component of wrestling
2442742 but it would be nice to have a bit more weight training stuff which will gradually come my presence there is helping a lot of things change
2442743 any time a nigerian athlete will meet a canadian athlete it will give me a cause for concern as much as i want my athletes to succeed in nigeria i also want the canadian wrestlers to succeed because funding will come for us i hope if we do compete against each other its deep into the tournament where both of them will win medals

2442749 our girls were challenged by the fact we have never played belarus
2442750 for us it was a significant game and i think our recent loss in the diamond ball against the usa helped prepare us for today
2442751 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2442752 we have so much more to give our chances are extremely high at these olympics weve come here to take home gold
2442753 this is just a temporary election result while we allow for political parties to make complaints before we can divide the number of seats
2442754 the only experience we want is the one on the podium
2442755 we were hit with some pretty bad heat in japan the first couple of days it was ridiculous
2442756 so far there hasnt been a day here to compare to that
2442757 i dont know if its redemption as much as feeling grateful im in a position again to win a gold medal
2442758 to go into the olympics as the gold medal favourite is a pretty special position to be in and not many people get that not many people get that twice
2442759 but im not racing 04 again nothing i can do can make up for 04 its not going to change anything but i do have the opportunity with this group of guys to win a gold medal thats what were after
2442760 its funny because after 04 ive talked to a few of the guys and we always used to say gold medal or nothing
2442761 then after 04 it was i kind of would have liked a silver
2442762 i ran into michael phelps and i got a chance to meet him and i was like can i have a picture with you
2442763 were living in a beautiful hotel weve got our tvs on the slingbox weve got our food our music got our friends we could be anywhere
2442764 then we go outside and just get a glimpse of whats going on and thats when we know were in beijing people everywhere any time day or night its not the usual craziness like back home its bigger here than it is in the u s the games mean more here than they do at home
2442765 in athens there was no excitement at all except maybe when we got booed in the street
2442766 this is all different its out of this world what theyve done in this city to prepare and how theyve welcomed us
2442767 eight oclock in the evening aug 8 2008 is a luck time for us and means good fortune in feng shui theory therefore we are planting 600 trees and also organize football tournament to welcome the olympic games to open in china and memorize the friendship between cambodian and china too

2442790 its not a girls sport mahood canadian netminder says wearily fielding that question for maybe the 1 000th time
2442791 funny how its only considered a girly sport in canada throughout the commonwealth its thought of as a mens game new zealand australia south africa
2442792 im really not sure why it never caught on in canada or why it has that sissy reputation men with sticks in their hands anything can happen theres nothing sissy about that

2442802 canada along with france and england have decided to boycott the olympics
2442803 then i realized gosh hes 60 years old maybe hes really going to have a cardiac arrest
2442804 i dont know the key to success but for sure the key to failure is trying to please everybody
2442805 i think that is what i have done in a lot of my life
2442806 i think thats whats led to this trying to be everything to everybody
2442807 and so secretly youre hurt from a lot of things
2442808 the more you talk about something like this the more you realize other people have almost the same problems
2442809 as a high level athlete and as the youngest child of an established and respected family in a small town you have expectations
2442810 and its nothing to do with my parents my parents were incredible they never put specific pressure on us but it just was there because of the situation
2442811 i thought it would be way out there and nobody would want to date me nobody would want to be my friend because theyd say shes the dark one
2442812 i want to let people know you can be a successful athlete and you can have big pressure in your life and sometimes the big reaction to that pressure is you cant deal with it the way that you would love to and sometimes you do have dark moments and its not abnormal to go through that
2442813 kazakhstan has some good boxers but hes a good place to get the ball rolling
2442814 i guess to be the best youve got to beat everyone sooner or later
2442815 ive trained for this ive been ready for two weeks it was a long hard training camp and im ready to turn it loose said trupish who like sarsekbayev finished just outside the medal round at the last world championships in chicago
2442816 my main goal was to stay injury free and keep my weight down he added
2442817 ive been able to do that and i think i have high intentions for this competition
2442818 i think from talking to everyone in the village that were all ready for our events to begin
2442819 people try to focus on me as a celebrity in that sort of hollywood mode
2442820 but its really not like that at all im really more like the guy next door
2442821 they taped the skit two weeks before the new year
2442822 so i just went back to my dorm and forgot about it
2442823 the producer never mentioned it would be broadcast to 550 million people
2442824 a perfect name for a character that has the gift of gab
2442825 the chinese feel we are so different that theyll never understand us
2442826 people started to say hes more chinese than the chinese
2442827 anyone who says anything positive about china is looked at skeptically
2442828 the chinese people are so proud of this event of hosting the world theyre just happy and they truly think its great
2442829 nobody in china thinks that china is paradise people know that its a one party state they know its not a democracy and they know that there are human rights problems in china
2442830 and in enjoying these olympics it doesnt mean that you have to negate all that or pretend it doesnt exist
2442831 celebrate what brings us together rather than fighting over what separates us
2442832 today we feel happier than we do at spring festival
2442833 its because our economy has developed so much and our president hu jintao has led the country well
2442834 id say his opening and reform policy of 1978 laid the groundwork for the prosperity we have today
2442835 this is a very happy moment for the chinese people
2442836 which is the essence of the chinese culture our culture is a
2442837 and while we want to win medals at the games
2442838 if the cup is not full youre not a very sincere host
2442839 we loved it but we have forgotten all about it
2442840 i think from the day he took over he had a vision of where he wanted the team to be in four years and eight years
2442841 if you look at any olympic sports there are the perennial favourites but there are always stories of countries and teams and nations with the right coaching and right change of mentality that find their way to that top echelon
2442842 i would like for us to perform our best but we will see the distractions outside the pool will be our hardest just being at a big event is a distraction in itself
2442843 the focus or the goal we started with is top eight to be quite honest
2442844 he laid it out what our pool is going to be who the teams were and what we had to do and if we did these things we could be a top eight team
2442845 hey you can do better lets go get a drink and find you a new girl
2442846 who would be friends with me i hate everyone and everything seems stupid to me
2442847 ganhamos uma partida contra um advers rio voluntarioso mas inferior n o podemos pensar diretamente nas medalhas ainda temos um caminho longo contra advers rias que temos de encarar com todas as nossas for as

2442880 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2442881 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2442882 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2442883 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2442884 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2442885 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2442886 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2442887 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2442889 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2442890 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2442891 the georgian side is right now firing on residential parts of tskhinvali
2442892 we responded to the last volley that hit tskhinvali and our peacekeepers positions with a counterstrike from our artillery and tanks
2442893 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
2442894 grupos t cticos han liberado completamente tsjinvali del ej rcito georgiano y han comenzado a expulsar a las unidades georgianas m s all de la zona de responsabilidad de las fuerzas de paz rusas

2442896 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2442897 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2442898 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2442899 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2442900 un combat s una lluita guanyes o perds res m s
2442901 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2442902 un combat s una lluita guanyes o perds res m s
2442903 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2442904 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2442905 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2442906 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2442907 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2442908 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2442909 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2442910 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2442911 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2442912 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2442913 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2442914 who are open to doing something on the production side
2442915 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2442916 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2442917 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2442918 je nai pas vraiment de reproches me faire cest un manque de r ussite
2442919 je nai jamais r ussi trouver mon rythme dans ce match qui tait tr s hach par les recours la vid o ndlr la diff rence de mon adversaire qui a bien tir et sest bien adapt e la situation
2442920 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2442921 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2442922 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2442923 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2442924 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2442925 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2442926 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2442927 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2442928 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2442929 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2442930 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2442931 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2442932 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2442933 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2442934 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2442935 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2442936 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2442937 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2442938 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2442939 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2442940 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2442941 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2442942 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2442943 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2442944 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2442945 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2442946 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2442947 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2442948 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2442949 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2442950 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2442951 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2442952 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2442953 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2442954 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2442955 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2442956 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2442957 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2442958 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2442959 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2442960 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2442961 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2442962 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2442963 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2442964 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2442965 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2442966 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2442967 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2442968 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2442969 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2442970 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2442971 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2442972 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2442973 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2442974 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2442975 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2442976 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2442977 this property demanded a lot of attention because it was a relatively modern brick house on a street where most of the homes were older frame dwellings also it had recently been converted to a duplexwith all the permits provided this is not the norm most duplexes we see for sale in toronto are legal from a zoning perspective but seldom have they been inspected and approved by the building and fire department
2442978 i did think is this really a good idea sharing an entrance and having the landlord downstairs
2442979 but the price was very reasonable the location was great and i immediately got along with both of them
2442980 i see in your eyes you good boy take apartment
2442981 visiting unannounced illegal by the way and striding around their kingdom barking instructions while evading their own obligations
2442982 ostensibly we share common areas and have our own bedrooms but its very much her house and the other housemate and i often feel like guests
2442983 i hung a tapestry down the stairwell to give a semblance of a separate dwelling
2442984 just in case i was having a shower and ran to answer a phone call but they were so seldom on the main floor that one day i realized i could walk around naked all day long if i wanted to
2442985 the shared entrance seemed awkward at first but its funny how quickly you grow into it and its kind of a nice feeling of not exactly like family but like a member of the extended family
2442986 mixture of food usually cold or at room temperature with some kind of dressing
2442987 to make a statement express their hopes and desires and make a difference
2442988 theres only one horse there now but it is so beautiful
2442989 you can personalize your space at no extra charge in the courtyard model some people are moving the laundry upstairs
2442990 because the homes back onto the train tracks we have extra deep properties 50 to 100 feet of flat backyard
2442991 tests found hardly any vibration from the trains and a stable soil structure
2442992 you really need to be there to get the vibe understand the local architecture and see the colour
2442993 so we really explored the whole south beach area of miami soaking in the art deco style shopping in the neighbourhood taking in the daytime and nighttime entertainment
2442994 anyone whos been to south beach would swear this was it only north
2442995 transport the brand the entertainment the colourfulness and heritage of miamis south beach especially the architecture
2442996 its moody sophisticated dramatic but the finishes are so contemporary and theres so much light the response has been incredible from both male and female audience
2442997 in two hours you can see what you have accomplished
2442998 even if it is a small area we did that
2442999 since she is the only dog in the building she gets lots of attention we hear stories about how people miss their dogs and what tricks the dogs could do or what mischief they got into
2443000 if we come home from our walk through the party room when people are playing cards everyone stops playing and molly stops at every table
2443001 it is a decision we are very pleased that we made because of the lovely surroundings and most of all because of the wonderful neighbours
2443002 the community provides a great social life in the building with potluck suppers coffee hours birthday parties trips and other activities in the summer we have a shuffleboard where we can go and meet our neighbours and any one of them will look after molly while we play
2443003 molly barks when she hears one of us in the hall but i dont know how she knows who it is
2443004 my husband and i walk her three times a day we often think of the saying that a dog is the exercise machine you can never neglect talk about living a dogs life molly has it in spades she gets lots of cuddles treats and has a wonderful park to explore and walk through
2443005 its more important to educate people than to finish the plumbing and the ceiling
2443006 its a very niche market and it isnt going to grow very quickly
2443007 people in rural areas who are faced with having to pay 10 000 or more to bring in hydro then pay the utility every month for what they use are beginning to look at generating their own
2443008 hot water makes up 25 to 30 per cent of your hydro bill
2443009 with a solar system you can be self sufficient seven months of the year and it can handle 60 to 70 per cent of your needs the rest of the year
2443010 in this competitive marketplace you have to separate yourself from other athletes and the taboo of posing for playboy or modelling has started to wane
2443011 people hardly batted an eyelid when amanda beard appeared in playboy but 10 or 15 years ago this would have caused much more of an uproar in the united states
2443012 modelling is a way for me to continue with my sport the hours are flexible and you can earn good money through photographic modelling and the catwalk
2443013 ultimately it does not get away from the fact that you have to be an athlete first and a beauty second
2443014 but when you have someone who is fantastic at both then you are looking at a global brand
2443015 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2443016 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2443017 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2443018 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2443019 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2443020 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2443021 we came with enough funds we thought for six months
2443022 it lasted about six weeks our exposure to the canadian economy was a disaster
2443023 we were treated with respect by the jamaican community because we were mexican
2443024 i look mexican but inside i have an english accent
2443025 im canadian but sometimes i feel like i am an invisible visible minority
2443026 we wanted a future for our son and we had to find the right neighbourhood but every time we approached the banks they closed their doors we didnt have enough english and not enough income
2443027 my mother said i had to go to university and get an education or else id end up a dishwasher i came to canada and i was a dishwasher
2443028 i contacted the ministry of housing who told me i qualified for 2 000 in home start up costs
2443029 i took that return email to the municipal government who said sure well put you on the waiting list
2443030 how long is that i asked months years they said
2443031 first in spite of the fact that we have a social housing corporation here similar to toronto we have a waiting list of about 5 000 applicants
2443032 we have the fifth highest number of applications in ontario so for applicants to dream about getting into social housing is virtually unrealistic
2443033 secondly most of the construction here is for buyers less than 1 per cent is for rental
2443034 the beauty of it was the whole corporate commitment and the responsibility of meridian and the corporate commitment of royal lepage
2443035 the community newspaper and our seminars brought people into a workshop so that everybody was able to come into a group and receive a presentation of basically all the information they need
2443036 they got it from a real estate perspective a community perspective as well as financial and even a legal piece that way it wasnt so intimidating
2443037 then we arranged one on one meetings and it was those that really helped them realize what steps they needed in order to get there
2443038 in many cases they applicants had sufficient income but what hindered them was insufficient credit they make enough to support a 100 000 mortgage but once they factored in the credit card debt it made it unaffordable
2443039 im also a member of the board of habitat for humanity and instead of a single house were looking at a block of six townhouses
2443040 they wouldnt have done it if they hadnt rolled up their sleeves and brought so much to the table
2443041 when we bought our home my son fell to the floor to hug the house

2443082 russland sollte seine milit raktionen unverz glich und bedingungslos einstellen und alle truppen vom souver nen territorium georgiens abziehen

2443100 it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him a helpmate
2443101 this is why a man leaves his father and mother and joins himself to his wife and they become one body

2443107 this coffee falls into your stomach sparks shoot all the way up to the brain from that moment on everything becomes agitated ideas quick march into motion like battalions of a grand army to its legendary fighting ground and the battle rages memories charge in bright flags on high the cavalry of metaphor deploys with a magnificent gallop the artillery of logic rushes up with clattering wagons and cartridges on imaginations orders sharpshooters sight and fire forms and shapes and characters rear up the paper is spread with ink for the nightly labor begins and ends with torrents of this black water as a battle opens and concludes with black powder
2443108 you see when there is danger a good leader takes the front line but when there is celebration a good leader stays in the back room if you want the cooperation of human beings around you make them feel that they are important and you do that by being humble
2443109 our job is not to figure out the how the how will show up out of a commitment and belief in the what
2443110 imagination is everything it is the preview of lifes forthcoming attractions
2443111 we trained hard but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up in teams we would be reorganized i was to learn later in life that we tend to meet any new situation by reorganizing and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress whilst producing confusion inefficiency and demoralization
2443112 now if you are going to win any battle you have to do one thing you have to make the mind run the body never let the body tell the mind what to do the body will always give up it is always tired in the morning noon and night but the body is never tired if the mind is not tired

2443118 ive obviously experienced a lot in my 16 year career and i have to say last night was probably the greatest night ive had professionally in my whole career
2443119 to have the president there was very special because we all have a lot of respect still for our leaders he spoke to each and every athlete on the team
2443120 to be around all the american athletes was very inspiring the guys we were sharing with in the athletes village all got back about 2 30 this morning and they were totally wired
2443121 she is by far the most inspired player on the team having just become a u s citizen
2443122 we have a very good chance of winning a medal im full of excitement for the doubles
2443123 my knee is doing better than it was at wimbledon
2443124 right now im just focused on the olympics and trying to win a medal and then on to the u s open
2443125 en verdad espero nunca llegar a ser asi de olvidadiza toco madera
2443126 its one of those moments in football that you hope goes for you
2443127 i wont be the first one to miss a shot like that plenty of top footballers on the best stages in the world in big matches have missed
2443128 there were defenders all around me and i really just rushed it in trying to get something on it and its bounced up and obviously gone it was up in the air and then it came down and as i turned around it was there in front of me
2443129 i had to get to it early i thought if id let it try to come back down again and take a touch it would have been intercepted or blocked i had to hit it as quick as possible it was a bit out of reach for me and i had a go at hitting it first time
2443130 maybe if id hit it with my studs the sole of my boot it would have happened but thats football you just dont know i was leaning back and stretching it was one of those ones where i didnt know where the ball was going to tell you the truth
2443131 coming back after winning the league is a new thing and at the start of the year things werent right with certain players one thing led to another and we probably fell behind
2443132 weve got to win as many games as we can to get back up the table weve had european football for three years with two rounds every year and wed like that every year its important for the club and everybody wednesday is probably the first game of all the european where youd look at us and say theyre a decent side everything weve done is right
2443133 i wouldnt be disrespectful to other teams but i would say that we need everyone full time if you had an all ireland league its hard to know but its been said on numerous occasions that it does need something like it to give us something more maybe generate more money
2443134 the biggest plus would be to get people interested that have money and want to be involved when you have finances you can do different things you need stadiums were trying to get one and were getting blocked and blocked
2443135 i think the league in general will have to change with the type of football we play
2443136 but even some of the games between the top sides this year havent been great either the football will have to change that little bit
2443137 it takes a long time were three seasons full time and were playing against clubs that have been full time for 20 or 30 years or even longer its frustrating on that side of it because the
2443138 all were looking for is that people get interested and dont run the game down because its not as bad as people make out
2443139 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2443140 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2443141 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2443142 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2443143 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2443144 what is going on is a massive bombardment of residential quarters in tshkinvali and other towns too
2443145 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2443146 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2443147 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2443148 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2443149 take from the altars of the past the fire not the ashes
2443150 firearms training is still a priority you will not see any decrease in the amount of training or funding for training
2443151 i think it really kind of shook the neighborhood up
2443152 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2443153 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2443154 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2443155 i suspect after youve had numerous busts somebodys future plan for growing pot in vineyards is going to be thwarted

2443157 the land of truth is pathless there is neither thing nor way to transmit at all all the practitioners are just toiling themselves in vain it is like the monkeys on trees trying to catch their shadows reflected on the water suface
2443158 when a swans flying alone through the blue sky its reflection is sinking deep down in the cold water the swan does not intend to leave its shadow on the water and the water does not intend to hold the birds image
2443159 leonid grach a communist and peoples deputy of ukraine from crimea said that if ukraine joined nato crimea would secede from ukraine this is an alternative for the crimean people for which they are ready by now crimeans will never agree to live in a country thats been dragged into nato said grach
2443160 we will discuss how to proceed with the pullout as of now they are still in dunguan
2443161 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2443162 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2443163 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2443164 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2443165 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2443166 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now

2443175 van ver zijn onze vrienden gekomen hoe gelukkig zijn wij
2443176 what about all those recalls because of e coli and whatnot
2443177 nu al betaalt iedereen zon 4000 euro per jaar aan premie
2443178 mensen blijven daartoe bereid mits dat geld goed wordt besteed dus w l voor de bouw van eenpersoonskamers in tehuizen niet voor bureautjes die je tegen vergoeding vertellen hoe je je eigen oma mee kunt nemen naar de film voor 45 euro per uur
2443179 voor afwijkend gedrag moet weer ruimte komen vroeger kregen mensen die niet goed meekonden een baantje op de postkamer nu komt iemand op de wachtlijst voor een sociale werkplaats ook van kinderen met gedragsproblemen wordt verwacht dat ze presteren veel eerder dan vroeger wordt ergens een medisch label aan gehangen
2443180 de vraag naar hulp blijft groeien vooral onder jongeren het is beangstigend dat zoveel kinderen al in een behandeltraject zitten
2443181 de begeleiding wordt niet voor iedereen geschrapt voor zware gevallen blijft er altijd hulp maar waarom moet iemand die slecht ter been is een dure boodschappenservice krijgen supermarkten bezorgen ook aan huis we moeten scherpere grenzen trekken wat kunnen mensen zelf regelen en wat is de verantwoordelijkheid van gemeenten ik wil de problemen niet bij anderen over de muur gooien maar soms moet je als overheid durven zeggen dit doen we niet
2443182 niet iedereen kan 24 uur per dag priv zorg krijgen dan zou de awbz vijf keer zo duur worden soms helpt een verpleeghuis tegen vereenzaming
2443183 destijds is besloten om een onafhankelijke instelling te laten bepalen welke hulp iemand nodig had zo werd voorkomen dat organisaties onnodig dure hulp declareerden maar het wantrouwen is doorgeslagen
2443184 yup this tip is a result of being amazingly bored and left at home for 4 hours alone
2443185 assure council and the public that taxpayer dollars are being used responsibly
2443186 oh but wont you still keep trying to have your own
2443187 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
2443188 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
2443189 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2443190 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2443191 oh my thats what i look like what have we let ourselves in for ladies
2443192 if more men came to see this play with their partners there would be more happier women in the world
2443193 it was a wonderful success it could not have gone better i think the audience would have been fulfilled and for those who took part i think it has been a life changing experience
2443194 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
2443195 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
2443196 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2443197 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2443198 we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon
2443199 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2443200 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left kewell has gone aurelio is injured and leto cannot get a work permit
2443201 babel is away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area
2443202 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder
2443203 maybe he can play in three different positions that is a positive thing i am talking about one player but i wont say the name
2443204 i will try to improve the team and the squad if i can i am pleased because we have not lost again i will try to do my best to improve the squad
2443205 the situation is not a question of money he is english and he can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left
2443206 the community shield holds good memories for me i headed the winner about 10 minutes from the end against chelsea two years ago and it was doubly good because i had one disallowed in the fa cup final against west ham a few months earlier
2443207 ive come back to portsmouth to further my career and it would be a great start to do something special at wembley
2443208 its going to be really hard against united even though theyve got a few missing but playing at wembley lifts everybody
2443209 its a fantastic occasion just like a cup final and with all the new signings turning out
2443210 nobody is allowed to participate if they have not had full health and safety training and are not wearing life jackets
2443211 the last thing we want to do is injure ourselves or anyone else
2443212 we are still planning to go ahead with it people have been preparing for this for a long time we are determined to reach kingsnorth by land sea and air
2443213 we are lucky that our wish was fulfilled by salman bhaiya brother he invited us to mumbai met us and we tied a rakhi on his wrist

2443217 alertarle de la posible urgencia de un caso de melanoma
2443218 i first came to palmer park in august of 1968
2443219 the city was still a shambles even a year after the riots its hard to be diplomatic about detroit its a very sad city i find it second only to new orleans in its sadness
2443220 i guess it all started with henry ford and his automobile
2443221 he made the city prosperous but he also planted the seeds of its future strife when he brought thousands of people up from the deep south to work on his assembly lines for 5 a day
2443222 the educational system in the states is built on property taxes
2443223 but when so many white people moved away following the riots the detroit school system was in dire straits
2443224 that integration in america is what happens between the first black moving in and the last white moving out it usually takes two to four years
2443225 but her husband played by dan chameroy is entirely different from my husband
2443226 its a little delicate to have a white lady writing about it
2443227 but there hasnt been a lot written about the black middle class the ones who did everything you were supposed to do to be accepted by the white community in those days only to find the wall was still up
2443228 the broke down detroit school system was using busing as its answer to everything
2443229 they were taking kids who came from homes where there was one toilet down the hall for five families and sending them to schools in upper class suburbs where the recess conversation would be oh are you going to bermuda for christmas
2443230 by my daughters last year in school she was one of four white children in her class today palmer park is only 10 per cent white and thats mainly old people who just dont want to leave
2443231 because segregation has seeped back into the american schools even worse than it was back in the 1950s and the worst part is that it seems like theres hardly anybody even trying
2443232 lets hop a cab and split it im kiddin were both going to where you livin
2443233 this is respectfully dedicated to the woman who concentrated all of her love to find that shed wasted it all on the liar who lied in this song

2443240 the deportation order came from the presidents office and was handed to mr zvayi in front of journalists mostly from the foreign media though the state broadcaster was also present
2443241 there is no logic to what botswana is doing right now we can only wonder what they are driving at their foreign minister has been making strange statements about zimbabwe that are in total opposition to what the rest of sadc is saying and naturally people will start asking what their agenda is if its true that they based their decision on the eu sanctions decision then it is quite unfortunate because it would mean botswana is closer to europe than to sadc
2443242 in fact asked britain to govern its affairs as a protectorate
2443243 their conception of the issues that matter most to sadc will be different and their engagement of their neighbours is informed by a different context
2443244 when a country has more goats than people it suffers a serious leadership deficiency as is happening in botswana where a primitive and intolerant military junta is masquerading as a democracy
2443245 they cannot hide the obvious fact that their unlawful deportation of zvayi who was in fact in that country legally with a work permit and not as a journalist but as a college lecturer has been done simply to please george bushs criminal administration that put zvayi on its illegal sanctions list against zimbabwe
2443246 the botswana government apparently has a monkey see monkey do approach i suppose because what uncle sam does uncle tom follows in the end botswana will pay a heavy regional price for its shocking treachery including its xenophobic treatment of zimbabweans in general
2443247 the maliciousness and childishness of this campaign is testimony of the fickleness of the people behind it who apparently believe universities employ people on political grounds
2443248 they need only look at the university of zimbabwe today whose chancellor is president mugabe but which employs vocal mdc office holders sympathisers and activists like lovemore madhuku john makumbe and eliphas mukonoweshuro
2443249 este llamado es una gran motivacion para seguir mejorando y por tal manera debo seguir trabajando al m ximo para convencer al t cnico de la selecci n
2443250 lo primero es quedar en la lista que buscar un lugar para asistir al mundial de sudafrica 2010 y como mi segunda meta es ir a la copa del mundo
2443251 seguramente utilizar el sistema europeo de pocos toques para llegar al rea enemiga y eso me gusta es un reto m s y trataremos de utilizarlo en beneficio del equipo
2443252 con muchas ganas de revertir esta situaci n y sobre todo de sacar la victoria siempre es importante jugar en casa y sumar de a tres pero no pensamos en eso sino en hacer bien las cosas este s bado para sacar la victoria
2443253 no nos preocupamos por lo puedan presentar ellos realmente nos preocupamos por nuestro trabajo y ya ver s que se nos dar n las cosas desde este s bado
2443254 up until 1994 there was something offensive about a south african story that simply bypassed politics
2443255 in theory thats not the case anymore were free to write about absolutely anything
2443256 but in practise its not so simple just because this is a very highly politicized society the society is still shaped by the weird politics that apartheid depended on so that even seemingly innocent subjects take you into that area
2443257 its a characteristic of pretty much anything ive ever written that youve got that air of something brooding thats about to happen
2443258 that applies as much to my own psyche as it does to the south african psyche at large i dont know how much coverage you get of the south african political situation but were not in a great place right now
2443259 to put it simply we have a very corrupt government right now and theyre intent on removing the checks and balances that still stand in their way
2443260 during that period a lot of my relations used to come and read stories to me
2443261 psychologically i associate stories with love attention and consolation so there was an impetus to try to create that
2443262 nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp http web
2443263 i have been thinking about winning a medal but i never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china i am very happy and i did a good job
2443264 now i have achieved the very best everything that i could get especially since its my first gold at the olympics it feels amazing
2443265 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2443266 a company accepts to develop one of my ideas they pay me upfront an amount for doing so they develop the product and sell it we divide the profits
2443267 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2443268 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
2443269 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
2443270 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
2443271 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
2443272 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum
2443273 as a vehicle travels through a corner a high amount of force is exerted through the tires footprint
2443274 due to the load transfer characteristics of the vehicle an increased amount of force moves to the outside shoulder of the tire and the grip on the outside of the tread is enhanced while the grip on the inside decreases in comparison
2443275 with active cornergrip technology the tire to road contact is increased on the inside of the contact area this technology in the inside sidewall of the tire helps compress the tread evenly on the road for enhanced traction while cornering
2443276 if anything is going to get whacked its the luxury segment
2443277 well actually the first time in 2004 i didnt really do a lot of the driving
2443278 i was on a team with my dad and dave lacey and it was a peculiar race because there was a whole lot of rain they said well put you out there but youre kind of inexperienced so it wont be for long so yes i was on the podium but i didnt feel as if i had much to do with it
2443279 the 2005 race was different i took a regular turn and felt much more a part of the team
2443280 but i never ran for a championship it was more of a casual thing i never ran a full season because my dad was busy with his racing and it was tough to get to all the kart races wed pick five or six races to go to but that was all we had time for
2443281 we took a look at a lot of things and found the grand am series very appealing
2443282 grand am has a connection to nascar and because nascar is so successful we saw the potential for growth in the grand am that we didnt see in some of the other series
2443283 also we know we can compete to win in the daytona prototypes we can raise a budget to compete in that class in the alms you either have to be a factory team or have a very big sponsor before you have any chance of winning
2443284 they were very pleased that we were able to race in montreal and to win in montreal but yes it would be nice if there were more canadian races on our schedule
2443285 up until this year i was in school as well as racing now i just want to concentrate on the racing i have the education to fall back on if i need it
2443286 i love the daytona prototypes and i feel weve invested in the right series you could call me a confirmed sports car guy i left open wheel racing because of the uncertainty of where it was going its on the right track now but it wasnt when i had to make a choice
2443287 short term i want to win the rolex championship and id love to be the overall winner of the daytona 24 weve won in this series so that goal is within our reach
2443288 long term yes i would love to race at le mans sometime everybody ive talked to including my dad says its simply fantastic so i imagine i would want to go
2443289 i am really sick and tired of this idiotic behaviour and it doesnt surprise me the least that road rage incidents are on the rise
2443290 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2443291 damn that man you shouldnt sit beside him he is always looking at you he remove his headphone on his ear fix himself and look at you again he is interested in you what did you answer to him
2443292 there are only three people who are involved with every show we do guy laliberte vice president gilles st croix and myself
2443293 which is built like a little cell and no one can interfere with what they do we now have 250 creators preparing our future shows that may sound like a lot but to produce three shows a year you have to have nine teams working at all times because it takes three years from start to finish to deliver a show
2443294 our role is simple to develop a climate in which artistic freedom is possible and to give the creators whatever resources they need to work together
2443295 when guy gives a director a mandate to do a show
2443296 he tells them the kind of show he would like it to be
2443297 the normal show business industry standard is the show is open be happy lets make as much money as we can it doesnt work like that at cirque if were not happy with a show we keep working on it
2443298 the american producers are saying youre crazy its a hit why change it but we didnt like it and it will be very different this year
2443299 whose job is to travel around the world and watch quality control on all of our shows
2443300 if there is someone great anywhere in the world i want them to join cirque so they can challenge us
2443301 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2443302 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2443303 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2443304 no hemos comentado nada pero es l gico que en el trabajo de ayer donde se hizo futbol t ctico l fabi n est en el once titular como todo jugador le molesta estar en la banca pero no hay que bajar los brazos y seguir trabajando para que se presente una nueva oportunidad
2443305 en la din mica se mejora con el ingreso de fabi n creo que los cambios tienen que ser para bien y as hay que tomarlo en la din mica hacen falta varias cosas quiz un poco m s de tranquilidad en los pases m s inteligencia al moverse nos est faltando muchas cosas pero en estos momentos hay que ser optimistas
2443306 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2443307 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2443344 david was a fully qualified karate instructor when he first started up his club he wanted to pass on his knowledge to others
2443345 i can honestly say no students were in any danger whatsoever
2443346 i was always there at the desk and no student was ever left on their own or allowed outside the club if the parents happened to be late
2443347 i also know that anyone within the club that had anything to do with the students or the running of the club also had to be crb checked a condition david himself put in place for all his students safety
2443348 david had strict rules within the club no student under the age of 16 would be allowed to join unless they brought parents so that david could meet them and find out if they had any illness or learning difficulties david would never change with the students not even the adult males as this was a rule laid down by the ama and would not enter changing rooms unless they were empty

2443404 ha sido un arranque muy dif cil con dos visitas complicadas al saprissa y a san ram n no hemos jugado del todo bien ha sido un complemento los malos resultados y la inconsistencia de nuestro juego nos est costando encontrar ese nivel que nosotros vimos que ten amos durante la pretemporada habr n variantes en esta b squeda por consolidar el equipo pero si hay que estar claros que estamos en formaci n
2443405 por ejemplo nos han hecho muchos goles de t ctica fija de tiro libre y de tiro de esquina entonces a eso le estamos d ndole nfasis y el domingo hay que sacar el resultado va imperar m s el resultado m s que si se juega bonito o feo
2443406 es necesaria la victoria es m s en nuestros objetivos principales y en nuestra propuesta hablamos en hacer de este estadio una cancha dif cil para cualquier equipo donde los rivales sepan que aqu van a pasarla mal por la fuerte temperatura y la presi n del equipo y del p blico
2443407 el domingo vamos con todo carmelita es un equipo muy complicado pero hemos hecho conciencia de que estamos en deuda y queremos virar esto totalmente
2443408 hemos fallado en momentos claves errores de concentraci n y en las marcas el domingo vamos a estar m s despiertos que nunca
2443409 de seis goles cuatro de ellos que sean de t ctica fija pues ah es donde est el detalle tenemos que tener m s posesi n del bal n
2443410 por supuesto que es preocupante pero es de poner mucha atenci n a las marcas pues no nos est n haciendo tantos goles de jugada
2443411 la propuesta nuestra es seguir d ndole la oportunidad a muchachos j venes y de la comunidad pero ahora le toca a ellos aprovechar esta oportunidad el domingo vamos a ganar

2443419 garibaldi il presidente ditalia stato nostro illustre visitante disgraziatamente in un momento della sua visita il presidente italiano si riferito alla presenza di garibaldi nel rio della plata in un momento molto speciale della storia delle nazioni di questa parte del mondo e senza animo di riaprire vecchie polemiche e aspre discussioni diciamo al dott scalfaro che il suo compatriota ndr giuseppe garibaldi non ha lottato per la libert di queste nazioni come scalfaro afferma piuttosto il contrario
2443420 come avrete visto ho liquidato rapidamente la sgradevolissima faccenda garibaldi sebbene siatene certo questo personaggio non affatto cos docile n cos onesto come lo si dipinge e come voi stesso ritenete il suo talento militare molto modesto come prova laffare di capua e il male immenso che stato commesso qui ad esempio linfame furto di tutto il denaro dellerario da attribuirsi interamente a lui che s circondato di canaglie ne ha seguito i cattivi consigli e ha piombato questo infelice paese in una situazione spaventosa

2443445 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2443446 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards

2443449 bv labien musica have recorded my creation malabels but that wont stop me from recording my own album with the same title
2443450 ive already recorded an album with the same title and what is now only left are a few areas before it finally hits the market soon
2443451 i also created kumba handiende and it is very encouraging to see people copying you but the truth is that were not supposed to have recorded malabels
2443452 just that title alone is mine because it is the title of my new album and also some of the work on their album is the work i created
2443453 first and foremost vevela is not a creative force to reckon with he lacks all the capabilities that is why you see during his days with us bv labien musica we clashed over the decision to make eugene muronzi the band leader
2443454 in fact most of the compositions that we did were done as a band so it is laughable for him to claim that malabels and kumba handiende are his creations
2443455 for example munyaradzi nhekairo composed some songs which vevela did the lead vocals but does that follow that its vevelas
2443456 by the way did he tell you that he was kicked out of that band because of the leadership problems
2443457 yes its true that vevela is currently not with us at the moment although i cannot exactly say that he has left the band forever
2443458 last time he left a note at my home saying that he wanted to start his own things i am only hearing that vevela has decided to leave us through rumours but apart from that note he left he hasnt yet confirmed in person
2443459 malabels is a creation by vevela and when we left bv they rushed into the studio to record it now we are doing it in a new way different from theirs
2443460 as it is common that our business has drastically reduced due to the economic environment we are operating in the company after trying all possible ways to keep aloft has reached a stage where it is now almost impossible to meet its day to day obligations and operational costs and salaries
2443461 below are the terms and conditions of voluntary retrenchment scheme cash in lieu of leave accrued vacation leave days standing to the credit of the staff member will be encashed at the time of separation gratuity will be as per nec stipulated table severance pay will be equal to ones monthly salary as at july 31 2008 multiplied by the number of years served relocation amount equivalent to ones monthly salary as at july 31 2008
2443462 music is now a luxury to most people and given the maximum withdrawals they get in banks they channel that little to other things and at the end of the day music suffers
2443463 even our traditional distributors which are mainly supermarkets and record bars around the country no longer place orders for music the economic environment is just tough
2443464 i can confirm that one musician has already requested a letter of release and we have no problem with that we are going to have a meeting with the musician next thursday and map the way forward
2443465 we are requesting that you labour officer intervene as a matter of urgency we believe the retrenchment is illegal as they never got authority from the minister responsible
2443466 your employees have approached us as a class in connection with purported voluntary retrenchment scheme please note our interest
2443467 we have been instructed to write to you and advise you that in terms of the labour laws you cannot unilaterally retrench all your workers without the approval of the retrenchment board
2443468 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2443469 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2443470 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2443471 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2443472 we agreed as 2bg that 2008 would be a year for us to record our solo projects and now as i speak blush and kevin have recorded their own solo albums
2443473 these are bonus tracks to the people who have always stood by me and have supported me through thick and thin this is a full package of diana
2443474 some of us think that by being in the music scene and gaining some considerable fame is a passport to go the wrong way some of us think that they would be on top of the world and end up being impregnated by men who dont appreciate music
2443475 a fit 18 year old jewish man was sent to heim for treatment of a foot inflammation instead of treating the prisoners foot heim anaesthetised him
2443476 cut him open castrated him removed one kidney and dismembered the other the victims head was cut off and the flesh boiled off so that heim could keep it on display
2443477 of all the camp doctors in mauthausen dr heim was the most horrible
2443478 oh get real surely you never really believed it was true
2443479 you dont get progress if there isnt a bit of a push forward
2443480 legal to promote a woman or a black person over a white man if they are equally able

2443482 so far we have managed to put about slightly over 450 hectares under winter maize in chiredzi and planting is continuing and we hope to achieve our target of 1 000 hectares even well after the winter season
2443483 there are still challenges on the ground but the project is continuing and we are harnessing resources from various sources to make sure that the project succeeds
2443484 a woman was thrown from a station platform on to an electrified railway line today after telling two youths to stop smoking the female commuter suffered burns and a suspected broken collarbone and was taken to hospital after the incident at farningham road station in kent during the rush hour

2443486 a 34 year old woman taxi driver who twice lit up in her parked car was left with a 775 bill yesterday on the second occasion mary astles hurled her cigarette out of the drivers window when she was approached by a conwy council licensing enforcement official the official had been shopping and felt duty bound my italics to report what she had witnessed as she drove past the taxi
2443487 this was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to come over here and help support the war on the ground
2443488 it definitely gives us a piece of mind when he is out here every day before we roll out of the gate just to make sure that our trucks are above the standards
2443489 serving as an nco in the navy is no different than serving as a non commissioned officer in the army
2443490 we may have different ways to describe the role of an nco but the responsibilities are the same across the board accomplish the mission and take care of our sailors or soldiers
2443491 thats one of the great things of the u s military as a whole is that every branch of service is structured the same everyone exits boot camp as a soldier sailor marine or airman and from the beginning the ncos in everyones chain of command help mentor the young warriors into great leaders
2443492 my job is not always the most exciting job in the military
2443493 but i believe this is one of the most rewarding positions ive been in throughout my entire career in the navy
2443494 when i am able to see the soldiers who are on the road every day and i am able to see them return to their rooms safely at night to relax i know that i have done my job my greatest sense of accomplishment is knowing that i am doing my part to keep their vehicles as safe as can be so they can effectively accomplish their mission then i know i have done my part and thats all i need to know
2443495 i already have my 4th inf div patch mini football and four sets of army combat uniforms that i plan to store away in a display case at home when im finished with this deployment
2443496 i want to always remember my experiences here with all my army brothers

2443540 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2443541 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2443542 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2443543 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2443544 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2443545 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2443546 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2443547 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2443548 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2443549 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2443550 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2443551 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2443552 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2443553 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2443554 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2443555 i heard you yelling and i wasnt going to let go
2443556 deliberately and courageously exposed himself to enemy fire in order to prevent the enemy from assaulting through the kill zone and overwhelming his convoy
2443557 his selfless actions prevented the enemy from turning the tide of the battle and undoubtedly saved the lives of his soldiers
2443558 my manager called me and asked how id feel about it i said great and the next thing i knew i was on a plane to china it was only when i was there that i thought wow this is really happening
2443559 thats the first thing i said at the meeting with seven you do know im english they just answered thats all right you live here dont you
2443560 its about going and not being sure but knowing this is your chance and that everyones behind you so you just have to do it
2443561 i was expecting a fairytale like you see in the movies but instead it was a real learning curve i kept asking myself what am i doing
2443562 its all good and i really do believe anythings possible now i never would have believed this could happen
2443563 and one of the things that i had to do for the pre op was get a mammogram i was kind of perplexed by it because i was like isnt that what those old ladies get well i go in for that mammogram and 3 1 2 hours later my doctor is sort of sitting me down and kind of letting me know that they have found something
2443564 at the end of the day no matter what happens if i do have to take off my breast if i do have to go through chemo if i do have to do all the things that go along with this word cancer im gonna be ok
2443565 because im not gonna die and if i do ill die trying
2443566 i just couldnt believe how painful it was if i tried to sit up i thought i was going to pass out
2443567 it took me a while to get up the courage
2443568 the surgery has not hampered my love life at all
2443569 i would say to anyone suffering from cancer keep on pushing because its not something to be ashamed about
2443570 i never got angry i completely knew exactly the reason why i was chosen
2443571 im a singer who touches millions of people and my words and my knowledge of what im learning from cancer can help millions
2443572 and if i can help millions even if i can help one person thats one person more than none thats me survivor chick
2443573 cancer taught me to reorganise my life it taught me whats important and whats not
2443574 a few years later when farrah discovered a lump in her breast she got nervous and called me first for advice luckily it was only a calcium deposit
2443575 but my friends helped me realise that i could either wallow in misery or accept what had happened
2443576 i knew i had two paths to choose from i feel very lucky as someone who has had cancer i learned that you dont have to die look at me because of early detection im fine im cured
2443577 im well all women should understand that a mammogram is nothing to be afraid of its not an enemy but a friend early detection is the key to the cure
2443578 people hear the word cancer and they freak out its like cancer im going to die
2443579 you cant help but feel despair at some point its overwhelming
2443580 my fear was that i would die because i had seen the horrors of chemo with colette
2443581 i visualised the chemicals as gold liquid going into my body healing me rather than what it really is which is poison
2443582 linda mccartneys death in 1998 was quite shocking to a lot of us it really brought home to me how fortunate i am i didnt die
2443583 i underwent surgery to remove a malignant tumour from my breast and then took chemotherapy
2443584 it was a stage one cancer but it takes time to get used to the fear of having it
2443585 ive always thought of myself as a warrior when you actually have a battle its better than when you dont know who to fight now i feel stronger and more vital than ever
2443586 ive hardly ever had a period where ive been so fruitful writing songs it sounds weird to say but it feels like a gift anything scary reminds you how precious life is
2443587 basically what the doctors told me was that i was going to be a one breasted bald fat woman great
2443588 when you hit your 40s you start to notice that youre a bit saggy here and a bit bulgy there and however much you try to cling to your old look it wont work dealing with a life threatening illness can change your appearance faster than anything
2443589 i had never heard of a man getting breast cancer but i knew if i didnt get help immediately i wouldnt be here
2443590 when i tell other men the reaction is really theyre shocked but im not embarrassed
2443591 i had two young kids a great marriage and a career that was cooking along so i wasnt about to take chances

2443593 marriages are now built more around leisure and consumption complementarities which increasingly pairs men and women with similar incomes and interests

2443610 people want to make the right choices and they want help to take the right decisions
2443611 government must provide practical help with wherever possible incentives in preference to penalties
2443612 by burning fossil fuels man increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which for example has raised the global mean temperature by half a degree in the last century
2443613 spirals of environmental decline poverty and unrest leading to social economic and environmental collapse
2443614 we have everything we need to save it with the possible exception of political will but political will is a renewable resource
2443615 that is how they make it seem that all the top scientists are agreed
2443616 the governments chief scientific adviser sir david king is supposed to be the representative of all that is good in british science so it is disturbing he and the government are ignoring a raft of evidence against the greenhouse effect being the main driver against climate change
2443617 the system is too complex to say exactly what the effect of cutting back on co2 production would be or indeed of continuing to produce co2
2443618 it is ridiculous to see politicians arguing over whether they will allow the global temperature to rise by 2c or 3c
2443619 we are not saying carbon dioxide emissions are the only factor in climate change and it is very important that debate keeps going
2443620 but based on the situation at the moment we have to do something about co2 emissions
2443621 western governments have pumped billions of dollars into careers and institutes and they feel threatened
2443622 i can tolerate being called a sceptic because all scientists should be sceptics but then they started calling us deniers with all the connotations of the holocaust that is an obscenity it has got really nasty and personal
2443623 scientists who dissent from the alarmism have seen their funds disappear their work derided and themselves labelled as industry stooges
2443624 consequently lies about climate change gain credence even when they fly in the face of the science
2443625 the green movement has hijacked the issue of climate change it is ludicrous to suggest the only way to deal with the problem is to start micro managing everyone which is what environmentalists seem to want to do
2443626 governments are trying to achieve unanimity by stifling any scientist who disagrees einstein could not have got funding under the present system
2443627 it was long thought that clouds were caused by climate change but now we see that climate change is driven by clouds
2443628 this has not been taken into account in the models used to work out the effect carbon dioxide has had
2443629 we may see co2 is responsible for much less warming than we thought and if this is the case the predictions of warming due to human activity will need to be adjusted
2443630 these particles attract water molecules from the air and cause them to clump together until they condense into clouds
2443631 evidence from ice cores show this happening long into the past we have the highest solar activity we have had in at least 1 000 years
2443632 humans are having an effect on climate change but by not including the cosmic ray effect in models it means the results are inaccurate the size of mans impact may be much smaller and so the man made change is happening slower than predicted
2443633 i have been looking at cloud data going back 50 years over the uk and found there was a small relationship with cosmic rays it looks like it creates some additional variability in a natural climate system but this is small
2443634 it is a relatively new idea but there is some evidence there for this effect on clouds

2443674 more modern additions to istanbuls diverse collection of water transport had a boxy plastic look that made them out no more than the seabuses they were but the high wide bridge hunched smoke stack and long waist of the antique ships still on the karakoy kadikoy run spoke of departure to further flung places
2443675 when people are gone some deeply programmed part of his consciousness was insisting its because theyre somewhere else right fine so wheres she gone lets find that out because then we can fucking go there and find her be with her

2443690 ive obviously experienced a lot in my 16 year career and i have to say last night was probably the greatest night ive had professionally in my whole career
2443691 to have the president there was very special because we all have a lot of respect still for our leaders he spoke to each and every athlete on the team
2443692 to be around all the american athletes was very inspiring the guys we were sharing with in the athletes village all got back about 2 30 this morning and they were totally wired
2443693 she is by far the most inspired player on the team having just become a u s citizen
2443694 we have three options now first it may be played on sunday as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium here the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two a decision will be taken by the committee at 1600 hrs
2443695 the ground at gachibowli was unplayable and with the kind of rain here it will be worse tomorrow the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2443696 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground
2443697 i dont know which place we would like to play with rain everywhere in the country but dont tell me kolkata
2443698 im going to do my best to keep concentrating on the way im fencing
2443699 im having a great time and just treating it like any other competition
2443700 im disappointed because i had a really good game plan against her
2443701 i did really well in the beginning and i should have taken advantage of leading and i didnt she came back and she is such a good fencer i knew she would adapt to my game plan in the end i didnt make the good thrusts
2443702 a lot of top seeds went out in the first round i wasnt ready to let that happen to me too i turned it around and pulled ahead
2443703 i was thinking im not falling off this horse no matter what i just tightened up everything and just swung like a cat really careful on every hand placement took my time if i get into that good rhythm it kind of just goes into automatic mode thats what happened today
2443704 i was kind of nervous about not having podium training but i figured ive been doing these routines for a long time
2443705 what do i have to lose now right just go big
2443706 to go through the emotional highs and lows that he has of not making the team and then finally making it the day before the olympics its an incredible thing to see him go out and hit six for six out there like he did he belongs here were hugging him just freaking out hes a true olympian
2443707 we had an incredibly consistent day and he finished strong for us with that absolutely amazing pommel horse routine
2443708 they went out there and did exactly what we asked them to do which is consistent gymnastics
2443709 i was watching a movie dozing off i hear a knock on my door and theyre like youve got to come downstairs weve got to tell you morgan might not be competing so you guys have to stay ready we showed routines on thursday we showed our readiness both me and dave dave pushed me to stay ready
2443710 weve been in training all week together its tough to not have him on the team pretty much ive been in every international meet with him its tough not to see him compete he pointed at me i pointed back to him
2443711 we kind of like this position because we want to creep up there and surprise some people
2443712 we had a good meet today we have a good shot at making team finals first session is always hard too but the goal is the same we know that we can be on the medal podium stand we have the heart and energize each other
2443713 ive quite gotten used to the weather here during the pre games training
2443714 that is quite long way from here but i might appear there
2443715 wietnie zaprezentowa a si irenka i troszk szkoda e lepiej nie walczy a z chink wtedy nasze pierwsze rywalki w dru yn wce bardziej by si ba y uznajmy e ola oszcz dza a si y a za kilka dni b dzie zwarta i gotowa w dru ynie panuje doskona a atmosfera ju nie mog si doczeka kolejnych walk szczeg lnie e w sobot by o ich tak ma o

2443719 i didnt know if i was going to be able to come back one of the things i like about this offense is the fast paced tempo we put a lot of pressure on the defense its almost like a fast break in basketball
2443720 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
2443721 the novel tells in sumptuous claustrophobic detail just how alien and alienated a human society might become portraying a mighty far future city state driven by absolute standards of meritocracy turning against itself in hysteria and bloodshed
2443722 from each according to his ability to each according to his need
2443723 the novel tells in sumptuous claustrophobic detail just how alien and alienated a human society might become portraying a mighty far future city state driven by absolute standards of meritocracy turning against itself in hysteria and bloodshed
2443724 the insufferable red headed daughter of commander tynnott o t e
2443725 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2443726 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2443727 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2443728 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2443729 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2443730 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2443731 no no sequels a sequel implies a future and a future implies hope and hope is not consistent with the missile gap message
2443732 its 1976 again abba are on the charts the cold war is in full swing and the earth is flat its been flat ever since the eve of the cuban war of 1962 and the constellations overhead are all wrong beyond the boreal ocean strange new continents loom above tropical seas offering a new start to colonists like newly weds maddy and bob and the hope of further glory to explorers like ex cosmonaut yuri gagarin but nobody knows why they exist and outside the circle of exploration the universe is inexplicably warped
2443733 there are still a lot of people i keep in contact with here and its nice that they still cheer my name even though i dont play for the titans it was a good six years i have some good memories and a lot of friends and its always nice to come back and relive those but its also nice to come and compete against guys that i know
2443734 a lot of that was dictated by our injuries up front and things like that but coming from three years of starting and going to a backup role where i was the third receiver was a big adjustment
2443735 he has big shoes to fill for us and thats why we brought him to st louis
2443736 he has done a very good job for us he gives us a dimension with his size and things like that in our offense that will really help us i think
2443737 ive obviously experienced a lot in my 16 year career and i have to say last night was probably the greatest night ive had professionally in my whole career
2443738 to have the president there was very special because we all have a lot of respect still for our leaders he spoke to each and every athlete on the team
2443739 to be around all the american athletes was very inspiring the guys we were sharing with in the athletes village all got back about 2 30 this morning and they were totally wired
2443740 she is by far the most inspired player on the team having just become a u s citizen
2443741 we have a very good chance of winning a medal im full of excitement for the doubles
2443742 my knee is doing better than it was at wimbledon
2443743 right now im just focused on the olympics and trying to win a medal and then on to the u s open
2443744 we have to play as a team and we have to win as a team
2443745 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2443746 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best our best no matter how many games we are behind
2443747 maybe half of the team dont have that mentality their only thing is to finish strong individually and put up numbers thats great but that affects us you know as a team that doesnt work out
2443748 you never want to be in this position especially for is as pitchers
2443749 if i go there and be hard on somebody im going to look bad
2443750 im going to look bad because people are going to say he cannot when bad moments come
2443751 i dont know but felix and wash we are very competitive i can tell you very competitive i dont know if they feel the same way i do but im sure they are pretty close
2443752 with his history and competitive success we know he is going to come around we know it is going to get better
2443753 i tried not to think of it as the olympic games because my heart would start pounding i tried to think of it as the colorado state championships
2443754 i know he was saying im an olympian now and i will get the job done and he did
2443755 as i like to say he tore it up and he did it on every routine sasha showed he is a fighter
2443756 coming in the day before the competition and not being in the arena training at beijing normal it was not easy what he did
2443757 it is kind of different the lights the arena the crowd
2443758 not to feel the equipment the first event was a little tough but im pretty confident in what i can do
2443759 i know we needed my score everyones counting on me for pommel horse they just told me swing big i didnt feel any pressure
2443760 julio b j marquis maze hanks all of those guys have stepped up their game tremendously everybodys going to contribute this year everybody
2443761 the biggest thing with our receivers right now is weve had guys flash and make a lot of very good plays
2443762 but the thing that we are really emphasizing with the receivers and the passing game is consistency attention to detail the timing involved the spacing involved thats whats going to help us become a more consistent group
2443763 weve had lots of players flash a lot of ability at receiver
2443764 julios going to make some big plays this year he can go up and get it he can run by guys hes going to make some big plays
2443765 theyve both made some great plays those guys are athletic and physical and fast thats all you need for any receiver to make big plays
2443766 hvordan kan det s v re at de andre i bilen er helt blege og tavse

2443794 wasnt as bad a deal as it looks like on paper
2443795 i do not intend us to be a luxury tax payer
2443796 but only because we have to have an economically stable franchise regardless of anything else
2443797 too much knowledge and too much expertise and hes too good of a resource to the franchise to not include him in the process
2443798 hes a fan and hes passionate about it and it would be unfair of me to expect him to just completely detach
2443799 all that you seek without has already been deposited within

2443877 not every single minute of every day has to be totally organized ill be with a lot of my family and theyre fun to hang around with
2443878 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2443879 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2443880 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2443881 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2443882 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority

2443885 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2443886 which is ironic because it often does not describe human behavior well
2443887 to create desired outcomes act in the ways which are most likely to produce them
2443888 they are walling our wounded warriors off from participating in political life in the communities of which they are citizens

2443899 i think people are touched by his message and want to come out and see him and he seems like a nice guy to get to know
2443900 just before he went jump into the van he was signing and this was the last article he went sign
2443901 aloha thank you everybody ill see you on the beach yeah
2443902 an ultra intelligent machine could design even better machines there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion and the intelligence of man would be left far behind thus the first ultra intelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make
2443903 the total number of games it wins in that future
2443904 an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion and the intelligence of man would be left far behind thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make
2443905 hes talking about some weirdo technology this self improving stuff its an obscure idea that only a few small start ups are working on nothing to really think too much about
2443906 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2443907 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2443908 i will wait to see if a clean version of the rule is released for publication in the federal register and then i will believe it
2443909 can be defined as ordinary functions instead of as special forms thus spl is not a strict functional language but retains much of the simplicity of strict languages

2443914 i just wanted to finish practice right and keep the intensity up
2443915 we had about 20 live reps but got a lot done and guys are beginning to separate themselves from other guys
2443916 you can stand the same 10 channels on the hotel tv for so much
2443917 at that point in time it became very clear to me that he meant what he said
2443918 its possible that i would be drawn into those discussions but only if asked
2443919 in fact i actually had to bite my tongue from saying were paying him too much
2443920 wasnt as bad a deal as it looks like on paper
2443921 i do not intend us to be a luxury tax payer
2443922 but only because we have to have an economically stable franchise regardless of anything else
2443923 too much knowledge and too much expertise and hes too good of a resource to the franchise to not include him in the process
2443924 hes a fan and hes passionate about it and it would be unfair of me to expect him to just completely detach
2443925 fulfilled each and every promise we made to the international community
2443926 i never imagined going that long no way hincapie said of his 15 year pro cycling career
2443927 it was tough because we wanted to hear our anthem and instead we had to listen to argentinas
2443928 that was something very painful that we had to endure but for the guys who were on that team we look forward to righting that wrong we feel like we let our country down and we have a good opportunity a rare opportunity to do it again and make it right
2443929 i think you could see that last year when we got better when we added a couple of more pieces everybody out here is a superstar but at the same time everybodys unselfish and everybodys sharing the ball and helping each other on defense and wanting to win a gold medal
2443930 as soon as they asked me i said im on my way
2443931 we know we probably have the best team on paper
2443932 as far as athleticism and skills but weve seen that the best teams sometimes dont always win we have to come with a hunger like were underdogs were going to have that target on our chests so we have to be ready night in and night out to step up to the challenge
2443933 im so sorry i wish i was there to give you a shoulder and kiss away each and every tear derrick

2444024 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2444025 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2444026 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2444027 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2444028 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2444029 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2444030 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2444031 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2444072 ooh yes you have beautiful skin but how about our deepsea treatment line it contains essential minerals that

2444082 just got home from the a 1 smoke shop and im way excited
2444083 i feel i need to give this place an upgrade
2444084 was hesitant about trying another north beach restaurant but was pleased with this place due to one dish wild boar pasta is to live for and
2444085 ok so she will have the pasta that she ordered for an appetizer as her main and the tongue as an appetizer
2444086 marinated grilled lamb loin israeli couscous romesco sauce preserved blood orange vinaigrette epic roots m che
2444087 oh i thought you wanted to have those as sides with your meal
2444088 the victims are denying any association with drugs but police believe that this was most probably an attempted dope rip off
2444089 they are walling our wounded warriors off from participating in political life in the communities of which they are citizens
2444090 one of the things we were exploring together was what role posters play in social change
2444091 he wanted them to remain in the bay area intact and he wanted the collection to be accessible his goal was he wanted the collection to be used by people so now my challenge is to meet those three goals
2444092 in the investigation they take steps one step builds on the one before
2444093 just because the search warrant happened doesnt mean the course of the investigation has changed drastically
2444094 there is nothing inherently argumentative or prejudicial about transitive verbs and the court is not willing to fashion a rule that would require the attorney general to engage in useless nominalization
2444095 what it does is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry in the state of california
2444096 we believe the attorney general has attempted to influence voters against this measure
2444097 said kristine konrad the mother of three boys 11 9 and 3 whom she teaches at her san leandro home
2444098 this is a major victory for the rights of parents over the education of their children
2444099 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2444100 you can do more than just complain to your service provider
2444101 theres no method to the madness ill get service in the middle of the hallway and then two feet away nothing
2444102 i think its significant that the university has agreed to do this and i applaud them for it
2444103 i think its a historic moment for the university and the city and the county and the people of santa cruz
2444104 little chance of improved representation if the same management team was left in place
2444105 reflects a strong and clear commitment to the provision of high quality legal services
2444106 dependency court remains a secretive insular place where the rights of indigent parents to effective representation are sacrificed in favor of judicial expediency and entrenched insider groups
2444107 the victims are denying any association with drugs but police believe that this was most probably an attempted dope rip off
2444108 i had my appointment at the act costume shop in san francisco but i just couldnt do it
2444109 2008 is not the year to dress up like a clown
2444110 i am very happy to have the opportunity to work with revonda and the band again
2444111 they are a great group of people easy to work with and equally talented in my opinion this is their best project to date
2444112 in the investigation they take steps one step builds on the one before
2444113 just because the search warrant happened doesnt mean the course of the investigation has changed drastically
2444114 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2444115 ive been wondering why im killing myself and wondering why the democrats caved in to george bush
2444116 im going home for awhile to try and be normal
2444117 rapidly descending into with nary a check or balance a fascist corporate wasteland
2444118 casey died for a country which cares more about who will be the next american idol than how many people will be killed in the next few months while democrats and republicans play politics with human lives
2444119 a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2444120 on here last year youll remember that sw and i were married by a 250 pound german woman who served as the equivalent of a justice of the peace
2444121 i had my appointment at the act costume shop in san francisco but i just couldnt do it
2444122 2008 is not the year to dress up like a clown
2444123 wir k nnen auch ein bier gemeinsam trinken so schlimm ist es doch nicht
2444124 diese st ndigen streitigkeiten um macht und geld geh ren endlich beendet
2444125 schon im vorfeld heftig in den kulissen geschoben damit spoerr den posten behalten kann
2444126 ich glaube nicht dass wir die n tige mehrheit erhalten werden
2444127 so russia goes into this place and kills innocent children and civilians and we are to stay out of it
2444128 i hope georgia defeats the russians i hope the un decides to take their thumb out of their behinds and do something for once the us should sell a few nukes to georgia and help georgia put an end to the reds once and for all
2444129 russia shouldnt send their troups because georgia is independent country and have all rights to controll all georgian teritory i hope that war agression on georgia will end soon
2444130 those terrible russians shame on them invading a small and badly out numbered country like georgia you wouldnt get the civilised americans and brits invading small badly out numbered countries like iraq afghanistan and ireland would you what a sickening bunch of hypocrites
2444131 but dont take my word for it read what these people are saying about xyz product
2444132 somewhere over the rainbow what a wonderful world israel kamakawiwoole
2444133 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2444134 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2444135 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2444136 they will wait and see what is in the security agreement
2444137 perez verzet zich tegen de handelwijze van ajax en wenst zijn beroep uit te oefenen op het voor hem passende niveau
2444138 de algemeen directeur van ajax henri van der aat heeft afgelopen woensdagmiddag te kennen gegeven dat ajax niet wil meewerken aan een oplossing ajax wil kenneth perez aan het contract houden met dien verstande dat perez gedurende de resterende duur van het contract zich moet aansluiten bij de beloften selectie en geen professionele wedstrijden meer zal spelen
2444139 marco van basten heeft gisteren tegenover de nos verklaard dat de tweede selectie ook betaald voetbal is en perez gewoon aan het werk kan gaan dit is in strijd met de waarheid getuigt van weinig respect voor perez en is juridisch onjuist
2444140 perez verzet zich tegen de handelwijze van ajax en wenst zijn beroep uit te oefenen op het voor hem passende niveau in het eerste elftal van ajax daarom zal perez de arbitragecommissie van de knvb verzoeken ajax te veroordelen hem met onmiddellijke ingang weer toe te staan te trainen met het eerste elftal tot de mondelinge behandeling zal geen verder commentaar worden gegeven
2444141 one of the things we were exploring together was what role posters play in social change
2444142 he wanted them to remain in the bay area intact and he wanted the collection to be accessible his goal was he wanted the collection to be used by people so now my challenge is to meet those three goals
2444143 in alto adige si legge in una nota dellufficio stampa il pd conta di raccogliere 5mila firme entro il 25 ottobre quando in programma una manifestazione nazionale a roma il grande interesse mostrato fino ad oggi ai banchetti allestiti sia a bolzano che nel resto della provincia la conferma che i cittadini e le cittadine sono delusi dal presidente del consiglio silvio berlusconi sta continuando infatti a disattendere le promesse fatte in campagna elettorale in materia di tasse sicurezza e salari
2444144 hold me like a mother would like i always knew somebody should
2444145 this is life and everythings all right livin livin livin livin livin
2444146 love will wash your brain hug you like a ghost it really is the most
2444147 was signed by the artist terrance osborne but not by its subject philip frazier a founding member of the rebirth brass band it ran me along with tax shipping and handling over 250 which was still cheaper than a trip to new orleans and entry to the actual fest and thereby a bargain
2444148 every time i plan ahead it bites me in the a
2444149 turn left at the kermit the frog then go right at the gumby
2444150 i find that attending industry related social functions conferences and even my neighbors cocktail parties help me find new ways of growing my company
2444151 by asking the right people the right questions youll find that you can learn new things and different strategies for your casino computer programmer volunteers firm that you may not have thought of before
2444152 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great casino computer programmer volunteers business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
2444153 in the case of our casino computer programmer volunteers marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
2444154 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
2444155 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the casino computer programmer volunteers product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
2444156 starting up any casino computer programmer volunteers business is difficult in our case it took about 6 months of planning a year of fund raising and then another 6 months of building infrastructure before we made our first sale
2444157 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2444158 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new
2444159 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2444160 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2444161 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2444162 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2444163 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2444164 what is going on is a massive bombardment of residential quarters in tshkinvali and other towns too
2444165 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2444166 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2444167 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2444168 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2444169 its a passion and you never quite let go of those passions
2444170 joint venture we put out one expensively produced economic report a year
2444171 strictly from a psychological standpoint it tells you that there is not a lot of conviction
2444172 fund managers that are hot to buy one day turn around and sell the next
2444173 when you get that steady trickle the market builds on that
2444174 in between what takes the market down is not economic reports sometimes its straight company reports other times its spreading of rumors and fears
2444175 if as some kind of gesture we said no to new coal fired power stations we would be in a very difficult position of not being able to develop this technology ourselves it requires some new coal powered fire stations for the technology to develop
2444176 china is a nation built on coal so the idea that if we showed some kind of lead and we in britain say no to coal and china will say ok we will follow is just daft
2444177 we are responsible for 2 per cent of emissions worldwide and we have a duty to tackle that
2444178 i wish yall lames wud quit writin me sayin da same dumb shit dnt ask me wats up
2444179 se or gautama vengo a que me gu es por el sendero de la verdad
2444180 bendito seas dijo el maestro y de qu casta eres hijo m o porque s lo un brahm n puede aspirar a la suprema sabidur a
2444181 no s de qu casta soy maestro pero voy a pregunt rselo a mi madre
2444182 c mo se llama mi padre dijo el ni o porque me ha dicho el se or gautama que s lo un brahm n puede aspirar a la suprema sabidur a
2444183 cuando joven yo era pobre y conoc muchos amos s lo puedo decirte que t viniste a los brazos de tu madre jabala que no tuvo marido
2444184 dime le pregunt el maestro sabes ya de qu casta eres
2444185 se or contest satyakama no s mi madre me dijo yo conoc muchos
2444186 t eres el mejor de todos los brahmines hijo m o porque tienes la
2444187 m musharraf tait devenu un obstacle la transition d mocratique dans laquelle est engag notre pays
2444188 la coalition pense quil est imp ratif de lancer cette proc dure contre le g n ral musharraf
2444189 le compte ny est pas pour la coalition ils trompent le peuple
2444190 sil le fait ce sera son dernier verdict contre la d mocratie contre le mandat du peuple et contre le pakistan
2444191 pakistan ne peut se permettre de voir la d mocratie d railler ce nest plus le pakistan des ann es 1980 et 1990 le peuple ne lacceptera pas
2444192 es la mediocridad de un grupo de t cnicos y promotores que en el mejor de los casos cargados de buena fe pero sumergidos en un paternalismo anacr nico utilizan gaud una vez m s para legar su huella personal en detrimento de la obra original
2444193 en octubre retomaremos el tema con unas jornadas en el mismo fad en las que adem s de aumentar las adhesiones se estudiar n las medidas de presi n a tomar en el futuro
2444194 esto ha sido un desastre porque aunque ten an la documentaci n sobre los materiales y el proceso de construcci n no las han seguido
2444195 el problema con la restauraci n de gaud es que cuando se tuvo conciencia de lo que era el patrimonio en espa a ya hab an pasado 50 a os desde su muerte
2444196 adem s no hay una forma nica de justificar las intervenciones y los criterios van cambiando de todas maneras creo que gonz lez lo hizo bien en la casa de los botines de le n pero en la cripta que es la gran reliquia hubo una primera fase en la que se act o con contenci n pero al final la restauraci n se le fue de las manos
2444197 the war in ossetia instantly showed the idiocy of our state management
2444198 to do a creeping annexation of south ossetia and abkhazia and secondly to overthrow saakashvili who is a tremendous thorn in their side
2444199 we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2444200 i just wanted to finish practice right and keep the intensity up
2444201 we had about 20 live reps but got a lot done and guys are beginning to separate themselves from other guys
2444202 marbelle era amante del hijo de su esposo mientras l estaba en prisi n
2444203 you can stand the same 10 channels on the hotel tv for so much
2444204 time for tubbie bye bye doesnt make you want to grab the nearest ak 47 and go shoot something up just to make the echoing voices stop
2444205 hey that dude would be one hell of a dad
2444206 if this ad leaves a bad taste in peoples mouths we just hope they will give a thought to what sensitive animals think and feel when they come to the end of their frightening journey
2444207 im not bleached blonde with silicon and fake lips i have a good look i look like a fashion model
2444208 i got laid that day im still getting laid today and i have millions of dollars its a good feeling
2444209 in one column that would be a deal breaker for many readers eyestones refers to a group of african american teenagers who raped a female jogger in central park as
2444210 she kinda leaned over to me and said what were you doing in the park at that hour
2444211 certo ke alle 4 e 30 nn posso lasciare il cancello aperto
2444212 io lo so lo so lo so perch io lo so
2444213 i just added you cuz i thought you were cute
2444214 well my name is andrea its nice to meet you vega
2444215 no you see you are mine now it is time for dinner and time for death dont worry it wont be long
2444216 i want only your love and if i cant have it
2444217 i just wanted to finish practice right and keep the intensity up
2444218 we had about 20 live reps but got a lot done and guys are beginning to separate themselves from other guys
2444219 it was tough because we wanted to hear our anthem and instead we had to listen to argentinas
2444220 that was something very painful that we had to endure but for the guys who were on that team we look forward to righting that wrong we feel like we let our country down and we have a good opportunity a rare opportunity to do it again and make it right
2444221 i think you could see that last year when we got better when we added a couple of more pieces everybody out here is a superstar but at the same time everybodys unselfish and everybodys sharing the ball and helping each other on defense and wanting to win a gold medal
2444222 as soon as they asked me i said im on my way
2444223 we know we probably have the best team on paper
2444224 as far as athleticism and skills but weve seen that the best teams sometimes dont always win we have to come with a hunger like were underdogs were going to have that target on our chests so we have to be ready night in and night out to step up to the challenge
2444225 squabbling between those who favor increased welfare and those who favor increased warfare has giving the american people a temporary reprieve from having to bear the burden of yet another dramatic increase in government
2444226 this is what i can get i see something i like in this person so i am going to latch onto it as hard as i can what if theres nothing else
2444227 fulfilled each and every promise we made to the international community
2444228 there were a few times when i thought i was going crazy
2444229 ive been given a clean sheet of paper ill find something to stay busy
2444230 its almost like a second life what im going to do is so different than my first 64 years
2444231 that will be one of the most important summers in jazz history
2444232 i never imagined going that long no way hincapie said of his 15 year pro cycling career
2444233 molto buono la condizione generale del gruppo sta crescendo partita dopo partita anche i giocatori che inizialmente hanno patito di pi gli eccessivi carichi di lavoro stanno pian piano entrando in condizione personalmente ho avuto lopportunit di vedere gli azzurri allopera contro i greci del panionios e nonostante la formazione ellenica fosse molto pi avanti con la preparazione la squadra azzurra con cinismo da grande squadra ha centrato lobiettivo qualificazione che rintengo sia la giusta ricompensa a tutta la programmazione fatta dal ds marino in duri anni di lavoro e per i giocatori il giusto premio per avere rinunciato in parte alle proprie vacanze
2444234 negli ultimi mesi il ds marino mi ha chiesto solo ledesma precisamente quattro mesi fa ma la risposta del presidente lotito fu rnegativa il giocatore era ed attualmente ritenuto incedibile dal club laziale prima dellinteressamento per largentino abbiamo parlato svariate volte di walter lopez terzino con ottimo potenziale del river plate calciatore peraltro dotato di passaporto comunitario che potrebbe vestire lazzurro non precludendo larrivo anche di un altro sudamericano non dotato di passaporto europeo ma a quanto pare la dirigenza pare sia interessata a giocatori che negli ultimi tempi sono apparsi sulle pagine dei quotidiani
2444235 assolutamente no il giocatore questanno rimarr a roma come gi ho annunciato nei scorsi mesi il problema con la propriet sorto sulla questione contrattuale tutti sanno il valore di cristian e ricevere una proposta sullingaggio non allaltezza delle sue potenzialit mi sembrata un presa in giro per questo confermo che ledesma nella prossima stagione ricorrer allarticolo 17 che consente al giocatore di poter andare via ma solo per giocare da un campionato diverso da quello del club di appartenenza quindi non escludo lipotesi spagna ma nel calcio mai dire mai
2444236 direi proprio di no i due giocatori per caratteristiche solo molto diversi ledesma oltre ad avere qualche anno pi di esperienza rispetto a
2444237 penso di si sono arrivati sicuramente degli ottimi giocatori maggio e rinaudo gi sono due certezze denis una vera scommessa ma credo che far sicuramente bene quando avr il modo di confrontarsi con lavezzi infine russotto un giovane che conosco benissimo che ha grandi numeri grandi mezzi tecnici e fisici potrebbe essere il giocatore capace di risolvere le partite ormai perse entrando anche negli ultimi minuti un po come faceva robbiati nella fiorentina in definitiva vedo il napoli tra le prime sette sette squadre in serie a
2444238 per etica professionale difficilmente sono incline a fare nomi se proprio dovessi citarne alcuni direi hernandez under 20 uruguay seguito gi da diverse squadre italiane che ritengo in prospettiva un attaccante da doppia cifra per un campionato difficile come quello italiano e poi wellington giovane brasiliano che pare per sia stato acquistato proprio in queste ore dallhoffenheim poteva essere un grandissimo colpo
2444239 um thats cuz no one lives in most of them a lot of them were foreclosed upon
2444240 they are walling our wounded warriors off from participating in political life in the communities of which they are citizens
2444241 it is an ideological cultural religious and social army that will be charged with carrying out an intellectual and scientific holy war and to free the minds hearts and souls from the secularist western onslaught and is absolutely prohibited from the use of arms
2444242 they will wait and see what is in the security agreement
2444243 arup consult the physicians guide to laboratory test selection and interpretation
2444244 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2444245 the victims are denying any association with drugs but police believe that this was most probably an attempted dope rip off
2444246 i think its significant that the university has agreed to do this and i applaud them for it
2444247 i think its a historic moment for the university and the city and the county and the people of santa cruz
2444248 in the investigation they take steps one step builds on the one before
2444249 just because the search warrant happened doesnt mean the course of the investigation has changed drastically
2444250 there is nothing inherently argumentative or prejudicial about transitive verbs and the court is not willing to fashion a rule that would require the attorney general to engage in useless nominalization
2444251 what it does is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry in the state of california
2444252 we believe the attorney general has attempted to influence voters against this measure
2444253 one of the things we were exploring together was what role posters play in social change
2444254 he wanted them to remain in the bay area intact and he wanted the collection to be accessible his goal was he wanted the collection to be used by people so now my challenge is to meet those three goals
2444255 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2444256 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2444257 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2444258 said janusz bugajski of the center for strategic and international studies
2444259 you can do more than just complain to your service provider
2444260 theres no method to the madness ill get service in the middle of the hallway and then two feet away nothing
2444261 not every single minute of every day has to be totally organized ill be with a lot of my family and theyre fun to hang around with
2444262 in the investigation they take steps one step builds on the one before
2444263 just because the search warrant happened doesnt mean the course of the investigation has changed drastically
2444264 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2444265 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2444266 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2444267 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2444268 we created the program to give these deserving children a boost and provide a convenient way for the public to help them during this challenging time
2444269 little chance of improved representation if the same management team was left in place
2444270 reflects a strong and clear commitment to the provision of high quality legal services
2444271 dependency court remains a secretive insular place where the rights of indigent parents to effective representation are sacrificed in favor of judicial expediency and entrenched insider groups
2444272 i had my appointment at the act costume shop in san francisco but i just couldnt do it
2444273 2008 is not the year to dress up like a clown
2444274 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2444275 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2444276 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2444277 an early draft of the regulation found its way into public circulation before it had reached my review
2444278 it contained words that lead some to conclude my intent is to deal with the subject of contraceptives somehow defining them as abortion not true
2444279 i will wait to see if a clean version of the rule is released for publication in the federal register and then i will believe it
2444280 said kristine konrad the mother of three boys 11 9 and 3 whom she teaches at her san leandro home
2444281 this is a major victory for the rights of parents over the education of their children
2444282 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2444283 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2444284 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2444285 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2444286 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2444287 he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
2444288 we feel our reporting and our investigation have been vindicated
2444289 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known
2444290 at that point in time it became very clear to me that he meant what he said
2444291 its possible that i would be drawn into those discussions but only if asked
2444292 in fact i actually had to bite my tongue from saying were paying him too much
2444293 wasnt as bad a deal as it looks like on paper
2444294 i do not intend us to be a luxury tax payer
2444295 but only because we have to have an economically stable franchise regardless of anything else
2444296 too much knowledge and too much expertise and hes too good of a resource to the franchise to not include him in the process
2444297 hes a fan and hes passionate about it and it would be unfair of me to expect him to just completely detach
2444298 they bse appear to have some problems but we are not worried even if the deal does not go through till date they have not made any payments
2444299 infrastructure is ready at ojhar we need a scanner which hal will have to rent from the airport authority of india the issue about the rent of the machine is being settled this will be done in a few days
2444300 i think its significant that the university has agreed to do this and i applaud them for it
2444301 i think its a historic moment for the university and the city and the county and the people of santa cruz
2444302 whether i play there all the time or not anytime i can make a play to help the team win its a great feeling
2444303 especially to be put in there late in the game and make a play like that i cant ask for anything better
2444304 the key to everything were still doing is running the ball digging it in there and fighting our way through that
2444305 and its painful and it hurts both blocking and running and the whole bit and that mind set has got to be there
2444306 just because we draw it on the blackboard and it looks good doesnt mean everythings going to work right those guys on defense get coached too and there are guys in this league who will break you in half on defense
2444307 well that attitude has to be on offense a good running team on offense is a vicious violent group of people they play with a defensive attitude
2444308 weve been so used to doing this stuff all over the field lets put them in a box and lets play lets have a war and see what happens
2444309 hey wed better go boys and thats what its about
2444310 i dont want to take anything away from braden because he pitched extremely well
2444311 but at the same time when youre lining up polanco guillen ordo ez cabrera sheffield marcus thames all in a row you would figure on getting more
2444312 vazquez was dominant in the early part of that game
2444313 to have that one taken away would have been definitely frustrating
2444314 i was a little nervous but i was excited also
2444315 once you get that first hit you think its not so bad i can deal with it
2444316 were excited about his potential there is no question about that
2444317 im open to anything that is best for me and best for the team
2444318 it doesnt matter to me whatever i can do to get on the field
2444319 keshawn martin has really jumped out at the coaching staff as a true freshman
2444320 hes explosive he catches the ball tremendously well hes got soft hands we have stepped back a few times and taken notice
2444321 no its not cold its just not hot im used to way hotter like the high 90s but i just like wearing long sleeves always
2444322 hes doing really well having a really good camp in fact hes probably one of the best on the corners to be honest
2444323 the media comparing us is one thing but the coach that coached him is another
2444324 i take that as a big compliment and know that he has high expectations for me
2444325 basically i picked msu because ive always wanted to go there
2444326 he can get to the basket and hes also a very good defender
2444327 hes been a hard guy to guard all summer long he does a really really good job of getting into the paint and making a play hes a really good talent a pure scorer
2444328 they have been recruiting him consistently and at the end of the day thats where his heart told him to go
2444329 there were a few times when i thought i was going crazy
2444330 ive been given a clean sheet of paper ill find something to stay busy
2444331 its almost like a second life what im going to do is so different than my first 64 years
2444332 that will be one of the most important summers in jazz history
2444333 glory magnificance 5000 of continuous history fight the white devils
2444334 every statistic shows that children grow up more likely to do well in school stay out of trouble and have a happier life if they have both a male and female role model
2444335 too often we look at these things from the point of view of the adult rather than the child i think that adoption by homosexual couples is unsatisfactory for the child
2444336 what homosexual people choose to do under their duvets is up to them but the example they set to children is of interest to society as a whole
2444337 if north american churches do not accept the need for a moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
2444338 homosexuality is a disordered behaviour the activity must be condemned the traditional approach to homosexuality is comprehensive a clear declaration about this theme must come from the anglican communion
2444339 anthony walker and michael causer and their families were not only victims of racism and homophobia they had their lives destroyed by something that is ravaging every aspect of our society sadly the events in huyton over the past few days is proof that young people from our poorest most marginalised sections of society are the victims regardless of the cause its also to remember that the perpetrators themselves along with their families
2444340 i understand there a number of high profile campaigns such as stonewalls much publicised education for all that receive a great deal of public and private sector funding as well as income generated from delivering training to tackle the issue of homophobic bullying but are they working
2444341 i would like to see sir ian mckellen other high profile campaigners who opened peoples eyes to intolerance in the past such as michael cashman angela eagle and lord waheed ali to reach out to working class communities and talk to young people in the street
2444342 in the 1990s they bravely fought against the biggest concern facing lgbt youth at the time section 28 a threat written on paper people began to think twice about attacking us todays threat is written very clearly in blood fighting violence carried out in the name of homophobia is now a matter of life or death
2444343 michael and those charged with the offences against him and those currently on bail were known to each other and had been together in a house in biglands drive huyton during the course of thursday evening and friday morning
2444344 the initial assault upon michael took place within this house
2444345 the incident was reported to police and ambulance at 11am on friday 25 july 2008 when michael was admitted to whiston hospital with serious head injuries
2444346 contrary to speculation i can confirm that this was not a random attack of a young gay man walking in knowsley
2444347 its very easy for the increasingly comfortable and apathetic gay community to blame working class youths for this latest attack but having partnership rights and a few extra equality laws is not an excuse to abandon the ongoing fight for gay liberation
2444348 lhomme est le terme unique do il faut partir et auquel il faut tout ramener
2444349 we want people to show responsibility towards themselves to others and to the environment
2444350 the city council will not accept an image of drunken zurich going out around the world this year
2444351 these comatose drinkers and rioting drunks who attack medics and urinate on emergency vehicles damage the image of the city
2444352 should the situation not improve then the city council will have to seriously ask if it wants to allow the street parade to continue
2444353 the parade itself has always been great fun and very peaceful the problems begin when people start going to clubs in the evening drink too much alcohol and take drugs
2444354 we have hundreds of thousands of people partying in a positive way and only a few people do bad things and yet people say that the street parade has an alcohol and drug problem it is no worse than at a football match
2444355 we are doing whatever we can do maybe it would be better for the politicians to work more closely with us rather than threaten to cancel the event
2444356 i think this is just a bit of power play to get the message across to the organisers
2444357 wahai fulan anak si fulan apakah kau yang telah meninggalkan dunia atau dunia yang meninggalkanmu apakah kau yang telah menumpuk harta kekayaan atau kekayaan yang telah menumpukmu apakah kau yang telah menumpuk dunia atau dunia yang telah menumpukmu apakah kau yang telah mengubur dunia atau dunia yang telah menguburmu

2444369 ogni essere umano che vuole la libert spiegano deve accendere una candela e un atto materiale e spirituale insieme come un voto un voto talmente numeroso che i leader mondiali non potranno ignorarlo
2444370 now exactly how would this whole thing happen you know how do you get the ashes out into the ocean from the beach without them all coming back on the shore and all
2444371 i have an idea to make shia the lead character next time and have harrison come back like sean connery did in the last movie
2444372 if it was mutt williams it would be mutt williams and the search for elvis or something
2444373 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2444374 the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
2444375 you start to lose your memory you start to lose your confidence you start to lose your invention so i think thats pretty much a closed book for me
2444376 weve exposed even more of installawares core functionality already available in the msicode script on our ides visual design surfaces
2444377 of course the underlying msicode script which the visual designers emit remains fully accessible making installaware a true visual setup development tool
2444378 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
2444379 we are excited about hosting an inaugural field of between 15 000 20 000 runners plus well be bringing not only our standard backdrop of having a rock n roll band stationed at every mile along the race course but also a world class health and fitness expo as well as a headliner concert
2444380 the race will start in suburban tukwila proceed along the shores of lake washington and offer scenic views of puget sound and mt rainier before finishing in downtown seattle at qwest field
2444381 theres a short life expectancy in distance running which is why most careers only last into the early to mid 30s a 35 year old is an old man in this sport
2444382 im hoping to make it through two other olympic cycles after beijing that would put me at 33 and that would be a long career
2444383 you never know what to expect thats why in this profession you have to strike while the irons hot
2444384 ill carry that with me all the way to beijing and remember just how bad that was
2444385 because of that i have a lot of determination going into beijing to make sure im as prepared as possible to do great
2444386 the workouts went great we ran in hotter conditions than we expect to see in beijing
2444387 unless i cant walk and my lungs are falling out or im coughing up a lung ill be running
2444388 it was just too much of a risk for me to run in london and i apologize to the british fans for not running there
2444389 i am still a marked man because i am defending world champion in the hurdles everybody is coming for me
2444390 it was kind of risky but thats the chance you have to take to excel in athletics you have to take chances
2444391 should i quit track i have this economics degree i could get a job and earn a salary
2444392 theres such a small margin of error in track and field that small margin of error can change your life completely
2444393 ive had to grow and learn i guess it goes with the event hurdles is a learning technical event
2444394 would fall under the new wada code that carries a four year ban
2444395 i find it frustrating that such planned cheating is still going on i am very disappointed
2444396 ive been fortunate to be able to share my passions of running and adventure with thousands of fellow runners for close to three decades now
2444397 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2444398 a 180 pound person burns about 415 calories during a typical treadmill workout of 60 minutes
2444399 the same 180 pound person will burn 465 calories as a result of 4 minutes on the rom machine
2444400 who needs endurance how often do you really need to run a mile
2444401 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2444402 ive alluded to this injury a few times so heres the gist at an
2444403 what kind of racer are you do you stand around and analyze everything you did and beat yourself up because you could have done better
2444404 i should have gone with that guy who passed me
2444405 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2444406 heres number 733 dimity and she just finished up ironman couer dalene so this race is just icing on the cake for her

2444411 amanda beard posed for a nude picture as part of a publicity campaign run by the animal rights group people for the ethical treatment of animals peta
2444412 i thought running was everything my freshman year in college and if i had a bad workout that affected my attitude and mood the whole day
2444413 i realized i had life goals and more of a perspective and i knew what values i have and what is most important in my life i have learned not to limit yourself
2444414 its a great honor for me that my teammates chose to vote for me the opening ceremony is the best day and the best moment of olympic life
2444415 im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
2444416 everybody came out here together and its something ive always liked about haddonfield
2444417 there is a sense of community here and you are always representing more than yourself
2444418 my goals right now are to take it one round at a time get to the final in beijing and go from there
2444419 im in good shape right now and i think im ready to run faster than 4 05
2444420 those of us that are blessed enough to be here anna willard lindsey anderson and myself are writing the history books
2444421 i feel very honored to be in this position but also a bit of responsibility to put my best foot forward and give all future female steeplers a respectable starting point
2444422 i think it is mine to give away basically if im doing what i need to do i think the gold should be there
2444423 i think there is going to be a genetic component
2444424 and theres simply going to be some athletes who will be able to tolerate it better and thats the crap shoot they have never had before
2444425 every major running event in the country is getting bigger every year a lot of kids are going with their parents to the road races i get beat by a lot of 10 year old kids nowadays and im happy about it
2444426 athletes i looked up to and wanted to be like im getting so many e mails and so much support from past olympians that i got the chance to meet when i was younger it just makes me laugh
2444427 the thought of being able to walk into that stadium wearing the maple leaf it just gives me chills
2444428 helped my confidence in some way and in other ways it can shatter your confidence
2444429 every race i run and every time i step on the line i feel a little more like i belong at that level
2444430 you have 10 chances to mess something up it doesnt really matter what youve done up until this point it has no bearing on what youll do at the olympic games more
2444431 if you have a great personality the crowds buy into you and that will make you a more in demand person
2444432 shawn what are you going to get maurice for christmas
2444433 the competitors who compete against me i dont think theyre overlooking me
2444434 but i think a lot of the media is hyping the competition that allows me to maybe sneak in there and make things happen
2444435 the way people talk about it she beat me by miles
2444436 my winter training went better than it did last year and my fitness is a lot stronger this year the aim is to get a bronze medal
2444437 what i was thinking was this was something that was personal to my own family
2444438 john mccain talk about the mistakes that hes made in his past with respect to his first marriage
2444439 i was there for a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2444440 the bottom line was hunters friend said the purpose of the meeting was that she was having some trouble she just wanted to talk
2444441 nothing was resolved i didnt talk to them about paying money or anything like that
2444442 do you know how many pictures have been taken of me holding children in the last three years
2444443 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2444444 its kinda crazy because im going to be one of the first guamanians to tour around with someone big like that but its cool hopefully hes a real chill person
2444445 the het is about the police investigating the police some of the most senior members of het are former members of the original stevens inquiry team who only managed to produce 20 pages out of a 20 000 page report a report into the mcgurks bombing was published by the het two weeks ago it is as we suspected a review of existing material rather than a new investigation
2444446 we are not talking prosecutions and revenge here we want the justice of truth following any trauma health professionals and counsellors speak of those affected needing closure how can our families get closure without truth
2444447 i cannot pretend that the us military commissions are fair but how can we possibly hope to help mr mohamed if his own government leaves him to his fate
2444448 before the intervention of your government to help me i was more resigned to my fate to be held forever without a fair trial when your government intervened i had hope but it has been a cruel hope nine months later i am still here no closer to home still in this terrible prison
2444449 in particular we are concerned that ioms work in certain contexts is adversely impacting upon basic human rights of migrants refugees and asylum seekers including for example the right to be free from arbitrary detention and the fundamental right to seek asylum
2444450 creating academies involves the transfer of publicly funded assets to the control of an unaccountable sponsoring body set up as a company limited by guarantee sponsors receive the entire school budget directly from the government where state schools are turned into academies this effectively means that multi millionaires gain control of a multi million pound asset whose building and running costs are funded overwhelmingly by us the taxpayers and they cough up a comparative pittance
2444451 can combine a greater flexibility over the curriculum with the sponsorship and expertise of religious private or voluntary sector contributors
2444452 everyone who cares about animal protection and human rights to take action now to prevent this crime this kind of police arbitrariness against npos is something we might recognize in dictatorships but not in a democracy please stand up strong stand against this outrageous injustice my life depends on it

2444456 two friends and i were stopped by immigration officials at 7 30pm and were only released at 1pm the next day during this time we were held captive refused food and prohibited from making any phone calls
2444457 we have seen from the demo in sapporo that the japanese police will arrest peaceful protesters at random people are aware that there is a genuine threat of spending time in prison for peacefully protesting in this country
2444458 i have never experienced being stopped from travelling to a protest before the repression in this country is insane
2444459 although we recognise the frustration of many of the european activists if you had told me four years ago that we would be able to get this many japanese people on the streets and host an international protest camp i do not think i would have believed you
2444460 my moroccan torturers were using information supplied by british intelligence
2444461 co operating with the police in regard to future protests until these concerns are addressed to our satisfaction
2444462 we came here with an open mind as it went on we came to the conclusion that it was becoming a farce because of the hoops we were being asked to jump through by derbyshire police the police have caved in to mob rule we are going to withdraw this application and this event will go ahead without a licence
2444463 we are here because the single greatest threat to the climate comes from burning coal coal fired generation is historically responsible for most of the co2 in the air today about half of all carbon dioxide emissions globally coal form open cast mines is dirtier than that from deep mines so it is even worse
2444464 we are taking action to prevent the coal industry bent on economic growth from destroying our future
2444465 if gordon brown gives the go ahead to a new generation of coal fired power stations beginning with kingsnorth in kent it will undermine perhaps fatally britains chances of meeting its climate change targets if britain is to cut its emissions by 80 by 2050 the eight planned new coal power fired plants alone will wipe out half of our carbon budget
2444466 ah yes yer honour the registered owner of the house is actually mr d beckham but thats me honest ive just changed me name see so go on give us a possession order err no i left the bit of paper at home but you can trust a chap like me cant you
2444467 this body will be known in the future as a small group of ecologically arrogant people who are condemning the worlds whales to agony and oblivion for petty politics and a few lousy bucks
2444468 there were many things that could come out of this meeting
2444469 we hope something good comes out of these meetings and that the commission transforms itself into a body that protects the whales and not the whalers
2444470 the iwc resolution on safety at sea must be followed up with decisive action especially by the country providing the flag that allows sea shepherd vessels to commit illegal and life endangering actions in the antarctic
2444471 all flag and port states must take responsibility for enforcing international safety regulations and demonstrate tangible results to ensure the safety of workers at sea
2444472 flag states should decline to register any sea shepherd vessels and in addition port states must deny access to ports when they are used by this group to launch violent attacks in the antarctic
2444473 furthermore countries in which these organizations are headquartered and from where their members conspire to carry out criminal acts must bring these perpetrators to justice
2444474 the icr supports the rights of people to peaceful protest
2444475 in the absence of these flag and protest states taking responsibility the icr supports initiatives by the government of japan to protect its vessels by all means possible
2444476 you cant quote me on this using my name but quite frankly the japanese are full of crap and they are not fooling anyone

2444478 says dr prasad another medical college of georgia research team led by dr vadivel ganapathy first
2444479 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
2444480 he notes that while serotonin reuptake inhibitors commonly used for depression work well in these women transferring the drug to the baby during nursing can be problematic
2444481 we often see women who are medically high risk in combination with social and environmental challenges

2444500 instead of progress in the fight against high level corruption romania is regressing on all fronts if the romanian anti corruption effort keeps evaporating at the present pace in an estimated six months time romania will be back where it was in 2003
2444501 statistically impossible to attribute to the coincidental occurrence of procedural mistakes in individual cases other factors than legal procedural considerations have clearly played a major role
2444502 the romanian judiciary and or legal system appears unable to function properly when it comes to applying the rule of law against high level corruption indeed more than five years after the start of romanias anti corruption drive the public is still waiting for one single case of high level corruption to reach a verdict
2444503 we are witnessing the transformation of parliamentarians into judges and of the judicial committee into an extraordinary court
2444504 many of the measures that were presented before accession to be instrumental in the fight against corruption have been deliberately blunted by parliament or the government immediately after accession all major pending trials concerning high level corruption started just before accession and only after many years of hesitation have now been aborted and are most probably definitely abandoned for all practical purposes

2444516 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2444517 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2444518 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2444576 we have had great reviews in the past but the five star reviews we are receiving at this stage of our career are incredible
2444577 i am traveling across north america proudly promoting this cd in the last couple weeks i have completed over 50 interviews just in new york and los angeles
2444578 it does almost feels like were just getting started again after all weve been through together and in our personal lives as well
2444579 fans are singing along with the songs and never heard them before
2444580 thats what we did in the old days too try out new songs and if people got excited theyd be on the album
2444581 there was a fan crying in audience and i was thinking shes never heard it before and she gets it that almost made me cry i got a chill and paul dean and i just looked at each other and knew this was right
2444582 my life with loverboy is about playing live its all about playing live
2444583 how i look at it in the end the songs will develop and change onstage and already have even lovin every minute and take me to the top after 27 years are still evolving live
2444584 weve always had the chemistry plus the history behind us as well we know what we can do and want to do
2444585 my guitar sound and playing are a lot heavier now and mikes tone and range its just amazing people are going to be surprised this is loverboy today
2444586 we would not have put an album out if we thought it was getting in the way of great hits weve done
2444587 these new songs are respectful of our past and inspirational for our future
2444588 the goal of artistshousemusic org is to be a guide and a resource for music and music industry related topics

2444593 i think we can be great said mccoy the most established player of the group
2444594 weve got the freshmen coming in and theyre outstanding said mccoy who had 28 catches for 207 yards last season
2444595 julio b j marquis maze hanks all of those guys have stepped up their game tremendously everybodys going to contribute this year everybody
2444596 the biggest thing with our receivers right now is weve had guys flash and make a lot of very good plays saban said
2444597 but the thing that we are really emphasizing with the receivers and the passing game is consistency attention to detail the timing involved the spacing involved thats whats going to help us become a more consistent group
2444598 weve had lots of players flash a lot of ability at receiver
2444599 julios going to make some big plays this year he can go up and get it he can run by guys hes going to make some big plays
2444600 theyve both made some great plays those guys are athletic and physical and fast thats all you need for any receiver to make big plays
2444601 i feel like all the receivers we have are playmakers he said
2444602 all the ones that we do have basically can come in and play any time and when their number is called they can make the play
2444603 we were able to experiment at glenville because things were so bad that if we got a first down we got a standing ovation
2444604 from there we tweaked and developed it over the years at tulane clemson and west virginia
2444605 the version we run here at michigan likely will be different than what weve done before
2444606 ive played for some of the greatest offensive minds in the game such as mike martz dennis green tom moore and jon gruden and coach rod adapts his system to his personnel as well as anyone
2444607 i could throw the football so we passed a lot woody was a playmaker but coach rod came up with ways to get the ball to wide receiver rod gardner
2444608 pat white couldnt hit the broadside of a barn when he got to west virginia but coach rod figured out a way to use him and steve slaton by running the option out of a shotgun
2444609 ive always told my wife and coaches that if i ever have a big time job im still going to take a small time approach with my office door open to anybody who wants to talk to me
2444610 the best advice i ever got was just be yourself and im going to do that even if im coaching the super bowl champions in the nfl
2444611 if it aint broke dont fix it just improve it
2444612 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2444613 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2444614 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2444615 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2444616 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2444617 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2444618 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2444619 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2444620 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2444621 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2444622 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2444623 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2444624 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2444625 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2444626 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2444627 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2444628 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2444629 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2444630 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2444631 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2444632 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2444633 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2444634 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2444635 in the investigation they take steps one step builds on the one before
2444636 just because the search warrant happened doesnt mean the course of the investigation has changed drastically
2444637 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2444638 you can do more than just complain to your service provider
2444639 theres no method to the madness ill get service in the middle of the hallway and then two feet away nothing
2444640 the victims are denying any association with drugs but police believe that this was most probably an attempted dope rip off
2444641 i think its significant that the university has agreed to do this and i applaud them for it
2444642 i think its a historic moment for the university and the city and the county and the people of santa cruz
2444643 one of the things we were exploring together was what role posters play in social change
2444644 he wanted them to remain in the bay area intact and he wanted the collection to be accessible his goal was he wanted the collection to be used by people so now my challenge is to meet those three goals
2444645 little chance of improved representation if the same management team was left in place
2444646 reflects a strong and clear commitment to the provision of high quality legal services
2444647 dependency court remains a secretive insular place where the rights of indigent parents to effective representation are sacrificed in favor of judicial expediency and entrenched insider groups
2444648 they are walling our wounded warriors off from participating in political life in the communities of which they are citizens
2444649 in the investigation they take steps one step builds on the one before
2444650 just because the search warrant happened doesnt mean the course of the investigation has changed drastically

2444652 were working closely with the lead partners at the zelda sledz and weitzman wilkes law firm to develop our new online gaming for the greater society law curriculum
2444653 in hopes to provide real world insight for our studies that will prepare students adequately for the future
2444654 which probably means that well win this case handily the case put forth by my boss pamelia machesky was so convincing that we believe the jury will only be out for a couple days before they render their decision
2444655 the judge has a great law pedigree and this will allow us greater scope when the online gaming for the greater society case is argued
2444656 with students working hard on their online gaming for the greater society law mid term exams ive been able to assist the starbird kuhnke and shandy hyler law team in the recent online gaming for the greater society class action case this is proving to be a very good experience for me and it will dynamically boost the breadth of my curicular offerings as my pre law department advances
2444657 the only reason we took this online gaming for the greater society case to court was so we might avoid having to pay settlement fees now however we will be paying out to the plaintiffs though no more than our risk team originally budgeted
2444658 im really happy with the verdict in the recent online gaming for the greater society case which was argued by my mentors jolynn buris and diamond fiaschetti who work at the prestigious devin mcgee inc law firm downtown
2444659 once i have a better grip on how to construct convincing online gaming for the greater society arguments ill be able to apply for my legal license with the state in no time
2444660 well be doing mock online gaming for the greater society class action lawsuit summations on friday
2444661 and grades will be based on presentation efficacy of argument use of facts and argument coherence
2444662 a number of new online gaming for the greater society laws came into effect forcing lawyer ivory fontes to take up a new area of law school

2444679 esto es largo y hay que tomarlo con calma tenemos que seguir mejorando y hacernos fuertes de local
2444680 hay que ir con calma nosotros queremos ilusionar a la gente pero tiene que entender que el camino es largo y reci n se empieza

2444683 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2444684 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2444685 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2444686 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2444687 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2444688 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2444689 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2444690 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2444709 i know there are people who do not quite agree with the division of india and the partition of the punjab and bengal much has been said against it but now that it has been accepted it is the duty of every one of us to loyally abide by it and honorably act according to the agreement which is now final and binding on all
2444710 the great majority of us are muslims we follow the teachings of the prophet mohammed may peace be upon him we are members of the brotherhood of islam
2444711 the constitution of pakistan has yet to be framed by the pakistan constituent assembly i do not know what the ultimate shape of this constitution is going to be but i am sure that it will be of a democratic type embodying the essential principle of islam today they are as applicable in actual life as they were 1 300 years ago islam and its idealism have taught us democracy it has taught equality of man justice and fair play to everybody we are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of pakistan in any case pakistan is not going to be a theocratic state to be ruled by priests with a divine mission we have many non muslims hindus christians and parsis but they are all pakistanis they will enjoy the same rights and privileges as any other citizens and will play their rightful part in the affairs of pakistan
2444712 you will no doubt agree with me that the first duty of a government is to maintain law and order so that the life property and religious beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state the second thing that occurs to me is this one of the biggest curses from which india is suffering i do not say that other countries are free from it but i think our condition is much worse is bribery and corruption that really is a poison we must put that down with an iron hand black marketing is another curse the next thing that strikes me is this here again it is a legacy which has been passed on to us along with many other things good and bad has arrived this great evil the evil of nepotism and jobbery this evil must be crushed relentlessly
2444713 we are going through fire the sunshine has yet to come but i have no doubt that with unity faith and discipline we will not only remain the fifth largest state in the world but will compare with any nation of the world are you prepared to undergo the fire we are passing through a period of fear danger and menace we must have faith unity and discipline

2444718 christianity and judaism were also from god as we know moses and jesus were also sent by god i think when we will broaden our thinking and accept everything as part of gods creation and give them the same respect everything will work fine
2444719 we should stop thinking that islam is the only right path to reach to god
2444720 the religion before allah is islam submission to his will nor did the people of the book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other after knowledge had come to them but if any deny the signs of allah allah is swift in calling to account
2444721 say if it be that your fathers your sons your brothers your mates or your kindred the wealth that ye have gained the commerce in which ye fear a decline or the dwellings in which ye delight are dearer to you than allah or his messenger or the striving in his cause then wait until allah brings about his decision and allah guides not the rebellious
2444722 the sectarianism started right after the death of prophet p b u h shia and shunni but still in the time of hazrat umer and even after his regime muslims conquered half of the world then what is the reason that we can not achieve this height glory now

2444815 em escala mundial tamb m o est gio atual do biodiesel comparado ao do lcool nos anos 1980 ainda existe muita gua para passar debaixo da ponte do ponto de vista tecnol gico e o brasil novamente tem vantagens comparativas com outros pa ses
2444816 precisamos fazer o diferencial agora porque fomos apanhados no contrap ao contr rio do etanol n o fomos capazes de perceber no passado a import ncia do biodiesel
2444817 precisamos deixar mais produtivas culturas como o dend tamb m chamado de palma a mamona a canola colza o girassol e at a soja mas isso demora o ponto principal buscar mais densidade energ tica em culturas antes destinadas alimenta o humana ou animal
2444818 a mamona representa 20 e o restante dividido entre outras oleaginosas como dend e nabo forrageiro
2444819 a cultura de soja leva vantagem porque o processo de produ o de leo bem desenvolvido e totalmente dominado pela agroind stria
2444820 pensamos que preciso tamb m programar e fazer o zoneamento das culturas de modo que fiquem mais produtivas em determinadas regi es
2444821 entre 1977 e 1980 quando test vamos v rias mat rias primas uma produtora de suco de maracuj cearense a agrolusa pediu que tent ssemos a produ o de diesel com sementes dessa fruta
2444822 deu certo e as kombis da empresa rodaram por seis meses com esse biodiesel mas depois verificaram que os pre os pagos pela ind stria de cosm ticos para o leo de sementes de maracuj eram bem mais compensadores
2444823 recebi de uma empresa da b lgica 200 litros de leo de peixe que se mostrou muito bom para produzir biodiesel
2444824 no brasil existem dispon veis 700 mil toneladas anuais de sebo bovino para produ o de biodiesel um produto que deixou de ser res duo para se transformar num subproduto
2444825 a gordura animal importante mas pela quantidade ofertada sempre ficar margem dos leos vegetais
2444826 temos uma patente dos equipamentos e do processo de produ o de biodiesel com fibra de vidro
2444827 o mesmo estamos fazendo com a universidade estadual paulista unesp da cidade de ilha solteira nos dois casos pretendemos com os estudos que ser o feitos obter melhoria das nossas usinas em itens que a universidade pode colaborar como automa o e informatiza o

2444831 n s j conseguimos isso mas o m todo ainda n o competitivo
2444832 mas s ser vi vel quando cair para 70 do valor atual do diesel derivado de petr leo usado para queima em caldeiras ou para aquecimento em pa ses de clima frio compensando dessa maneira o menor poder calor fico da glicerina com um pre o menor tamb m no cen rio atual com o pre o da glicerina atingindo os us 700 por tonelada us la em caldeiras para gerar energia ainda invi vel

2444835 estamos elaborando uma patente sobre os catalisadores e o novo processo
2444836 imaginemos que se produzam 2 bilh es de litros de biodiesel no brasil precisamos lembrar que se gastaria no processo mais 1 bilh o de litros de gua que precisam de alguma forma ser recuperados e voltar para produ o
2444837 o etanol quase uma commodity um produto final e us lo estar na contram o do ponto de vista industrial
2444838 principalmente na regi o nordeste o metanol mais barato al m de se usar cerca de 50 a menos que o etanol

2444867 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2444868 now we have a way to do just that to derive pluripotent cells from patients with disease which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever
2444869 this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques

2444883 i can quite clearly say that the investigation is being held up there are people on the island who just dont want us going down the route of this inquiry

2444949 lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water
2444950 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkan kitab kepadamu dengan membawa kebenaran supaya kamu mengadili antara manusia dengan apa yang telah alloh wahyukan kepadamu
2444951 tentang sesuatu apapun kamu berselisih maka putusannya terserah kepada alloh
2444952 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah alloh dan taatilah rasul nya dan ulil amri di antara kamu
2444953 alloh mencela orang orang yang mengaku beriman kepada seluruh kitab suci sedang mereka meninggalkan berhukum kepada al kitab dan as sunah dan berhukum kepada sebagian
2444954 mereka sangat berpaling namun ketika akal dien atau dunia mereka ditimpa musibah dengan syubhat dan syahwat atau jiwa dan harta mereka ditimpa musibah sebagai hukuman atas kemunafikan mereka mereka berkata
2444955 ayat ini berbicara bahwasanya orang yang menentang atau berpaling dari hukum alloh dan rasul nya secara sengaja apalagi setelah ia diajak untuk berhukum dengan keduanya dan diingatkan akan wajibnya hal itu ia telah dari sini kita bisa menerangkankan urgensi mengesakan alloh dalam masalah hukum dan menjelaskan kedudukan berhukum dengan hukum alloh dalam point point berikut
2444956 mereka menjadikan orang orang alimnya dan rahib rahib mereka sebagai rabb rabb selain alloh dan juga mereka menjadikan rabb al masih putera maryam padahal mereka hanya disuruh menyembah ilah yang maha esa tidak ada ilah yang berhak disembah selain dia maha suci alloh dari apa yang mereka persekutukan
2444957 barang siapa menjadikan orang selain rasul wajib ditaati dalam setiap perintah dan larangannya sekalipun menyelisihi perintah alloh dan rasul nya maka berarti ia telah menjadikannya sebagai tandingan bagi alloh
2444958 adapun makna ridha kepada dien nya adalah jika rasulullah bersabda menghukumi memutuskan perkara memerintah atau melarang ia ridha menerima dengan penuh keridhaan penerimaan di hatinya tak tersisa sedikitpun sebaliknya orang yang berbuat syirik kepada alloh dalam masalah hukum maka ia seperti beliau juga berkata
2444959 dan janganlah kalian memakan hewan hewan yang tidak disebutkan nama alloh saat menyembelihnya karena hal itu termasuk kefasiqan dan sesungguhnya setan setan itu benar benar membisikkan kepada kawan kawannya agar mereka membantah kamu jika kamu mentaati mereka tentulah kamu termasuk orang orang musyrik
2444960 bukankah aku telah memerintahkan kepada kalian wahai bani adam supaya kalian tidak menyembah beribadah kepada setan sesungguhnya setan itu musuh yang nyata bagi kalian dan beribadahlah kepada ku inilah jalan yang lurus
2444961 karena itu barangsiapa yang ingkar kepada thoghut dan beriman kepada alloh maka sesunguhnya ia tela berpegang kepada buhul tali yang amat kuat yang tidak akan putus
2444962 tidakkah kamu memperhatikan orang orang yang mengaku beriman kepada apa yang telah diturunkan kepadamu dan apa yang diturunkan sebelummu mereka ingin berhukum kepada thoghut padahal mereka telah diperintah untuk mengingkari thoghut itu dan setan bermaksud menyesatkan mereka sejauh jauhnya
2444963 karena yahudi dan nasrani itu mengharamkan apa yang diharamkan oleh para pendeta dan
2444964 maka bersabarlah hingga alloh menetapkan hukumnya diantara kita dan dia adalah hakim yang sebaik baiknya
2444965 dan tidak mengambil seorangpun sebagai sekutu alloh dalam menetapkan keputusan
2444966 tentang sesuatu apapun kamu berselisih maka putusannya terserah kepada alloh
2444967 di antara ayat ayat alquran yang dengannya alloh menerangan sifat orang yang berhak memegang keputusan dan hak membuat uu adalah firman alloh
2444968 tentang sesuatu apapun kamu berselisih maka putusannya terserah kepada alloh yang mempunyai sifat sifat demikian itulah alloh tuhanku kepada nyalah aku bertawakkal dan kepada nyalah aku kembali dia pencipta langit dan bumi dia menjadikan bagi kamu dari jenis kamu sendiri pasangan pasangan dan dari jenis binatang ternak pasangan pasangan pula dijadikan nya kamu berkembang biak dengan jalan itu tidak ada sesuatupun yang serupa dengan dia dan dia lah yang maha mendengar lagi maha melihat kepunyaan nya lah perbendaharaan langit dan bumi dia melapangkan rezki bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya dan menyempitkan nya sesungguhnya dia maha mengetahui segala sesuatu
2444969 kepunyaan nya lah semua yang tersembunyi di langit dan di bumi alangkah terang penglihatan nya dan alangkah tajam pendengaran nya tak ada seorang pelindungpun bagi mereka selain daripada nya dan dia tidak mengambil seorangpun menjadi sekutu nya dalam menetapkan keputusan
2444970 janganlah kamu sembah di samping menyembah alloh ilah ilah apapun yang lain tidak ada ilah yang berhak disembah melainkan dia tiap tiap sesuatu pasti binasa kecuali alloh bagi nyalah segala penentuan dan hanya kepada nyalah kamu dikembalikan
2444971 maka demi rabbmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim dalam perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
2444972 adapun ridho dengan dien nabi alloh sebagai rasul mencakup kesempurnaan inqiyad melaksanakan perintah dan taslim menyerahkan diri secara mutlaq kepada rasul sehingga ia tidak menerima petunjuk kecuali dari kalimat kalimat ajaran rasul tidak berhukum kecuali kepada beliau tidak menjadikan slainnya sebagai hakim pemutus segala persoalan tidak ridha dengan hukum selain hukum beliau tidak dalam masalah asma nama sifat dan afal perbuatan alloh tidak pula karena ini pula syaikh muhammad bin ibrahim menetapkan bahwa memberlakukan syariah alloh sebagai satu satunya uu adalah makna syahadat bahwa muhammad adalah rasululah
2444973 menjadikan rasul sebagai satu satunya hakim tanpa ada hakim lain selain beliau adalah saudara kandung dari beribadah kepada alloh semata tanpa mensekutukan nya dengan sesuatu apapun
2444974 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatilah alloh dan taatilah rasul nya dan para pemimpin kalian
2444975 maka demi rabbmu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim dalam perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
2444976 ayat dalam ancamaan yang keras ini ada hal yang membuat kulit bergetar dan hati merinding karena sesungguhnya satu hal ini merupakan sumaph alloh dengan nama alloh sendiri yang dikuatkan dengan harfu nafyi bahwa mereka tidak beriman alloh meniadakan iman dari mereka
2444977 alloh menggabungkan perkara lain dari tahkim yaiu tidak adanya kesempaitan rasa berat artinya kesempitan dalam dada
2444978 maka tidak ada iman bagi seoranga hamba sampai ia mau bertahkim kepada rasulullah lalu ia tidak mendapati rasa berat kesempitan dalam hati atas keputusan nabi dan ia menyerahkan dirinya kepada hukum tahkim syariat alloh dan mengembalikan seluruh perselisihan kepada
2444979 menggunakan nakirah dalam kontek sebagai syarat ia umum mengenai segala persoalan yang diperselisihkan oleh kaum muslimin baik dalam masalah agama masalah yang detailnya maupun masalah yang global yang tersembunyi maupun yang nampak
2444980 apa yang diputuskan oleh kitabullah dan sunah rasululah dan diketahui haditsnya shahih maka itulah kebenaran dan tidak ada di luar kebenaran selain kesesatan karena itu alloh berfirman
2444981 apakah kamu tidak memperhatikan orang orang yang mengaku dirinya telah beriman kepada apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dan kepada apa yang diturunkan sebelum kamu mereka hendak berhakim kepada thoghut padahal mereka telah diperintah mengingkari thoghut itu
2444982 ayat ini berbicara bahwasanya orang yang menentang atau berpaling dari hukum alloh dan rasul nya secara sengaja apalagi setelah ia diajak untuk berhukum dengan keduanya dan diingatkan akan wajibnya hal itu ia telah syaikh nashir abdurahman as sadi juga berkata
2444983 dan bagaimana mereka mengangkat kamu sebagai hakim mereka sementara di tangan mereka ada taurat yang memuat hukum alloh kemudian mereka setelah itu berpaling dari keputusanmu dan mereka sungguh sungguh bukan orang beriman
2444984 merupakan dosa besar dan kemungkaran yang dingkari ketika mereka bertahkim kepada rasulullah sehingga rasul memutuskan dengan syariah alloh sementara di sisi lain mereka memeiliki taurat yang juga memuat hukum alloh lalu mereka menyesuai suaikan antara hukum rasul dengan hukum taurat di tangan mereka yang mana alquran datang untuk membenarkannya tapi kemudian mereka berpaling baik mereka berpaling dengan tidak melaksanakan hukum itu ataupun menerima namun tidak ridha
2444985 termasuk dalil yang paling gamblang dalam masalah ini adalah bahwasnya alloh dalam surat an nisa menerangkan orang orang yang ingin berhukum dengan selain syariat nya alloh tidak merasa heran dengan pengakuan iman mereka hal ini tidak lain karena
2444986 dan tidaklah kami mengutus seorang rasulpun kecuali untuk ditaati dengan izin perintah alloh
2444987 hai orang orang yang beriman penuhilah panggilan alloh dan rasul nya jika menyeru kalian kepada apa yang membawa kehidupan bagi kalian
2444988 dan barangsiapa berbuat maksiat kepada alloh dan rasul nya dan melanggar batasan batasan alloh maka alloh akan memasukkannya dalam neraka ia kekal di dalamnya dan baginya adzab yang menghinakan
2444989 dan hendaklah kamu memutuskan perkara diantara mereka menurut apa yang diturunkan alloh dan janganlah kemu mengikuti hawa nafsu mereka dan berhati hatilah kamu terhadap mereka supaya mereka tidak memalingkan kamu dari sebagian apa yang telah diturunkan
2444990 jika para pemimpin telah keluar dari alquran dan as sunah maka mereka telah berhukum dengan selain hukum alloh dan terjadilah perang sesama mereka sebagaimana sabda rasulullah

2445031 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2445032 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2445033 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2445052 weve been telling google about these vulnerabilities for years and they have not made corrective actions
2445053 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2445054 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2445055 well face structural changes so well have to make changes fortunately they are in a stable area of iraq
2445056 they are setting up checkpoints with the border with iran and controlling entry and exit
2445057 it was interesting with how he could relate experiences with his female clients in such a way that made sense there were a lot of useful ideas in this book so while it built on what i learned in
2445058 im not talking about normal swear words im talking about vile language used for one purpose only to inflame others rather than expressing an individuals opinion
2445059 i hope those who know me already will realise im not trying to be clever not trying to be an extremist
2445060 a very small group of fans have been pushing the boundaries all the time we havent had a safety officer in place well now we have and its time to reset those boundaries
2445061 i think stonebridge road the clubs home ground would be a fairly empty ground if everyone who swore at the ref was ejected come on this is football not a tea party
2445062 does the society get any input on this any vote or such like
2445063 will you soon be forcing fans to sit with cups of tea and prawn sandwiches during the match
2445064 the rule will not apply to the supporters who regularly sing and get behind the boys it is for those who crossed the line like at the charlton game
2445065 i think it was the use of the words zero tolerance that caused the problem and everything has been thrown out of proportion now
2445066 everybody in the ground would be thrown out if there truly was a zero tolerance policy to swearing including me and probably the chief executive too
2445067 but i totally support the notion that supporters need to think about what they say because we are trying to attract families to come and watch ebbsfleet play and the behaviour at the charlton game was totally out of order
2445068 this approval of bridion represents the first advance in two decades for anesthesiologists and their patients and has the potential to transform the practice of anesthesia
2445069 this is the first major approval of a product from our combination with organon biosciences and is a significant achievement for schering plough this further validates the value of our combination which closed in november 2007 and is already making a positive contribution to our business
2445070 the ability to rapidly reverse both moderate and deep levels of muscle relaxation during general anesthesia was not possible before bridion
2445071 bridion can provide us with greater flexibility to induce and maintain the level of muscle relaxation with rocuronium or vecuronium necessary throughout surgery and reverse that relaxation quickly when needed
2445072 gospel music is the common wellspring from which we all draw in my mind ive never seen a lot of difference between country music and gospel music the common denominator is that most of us got our start singing in church or were inspired by gospel music when we all get together like this im amazed at the cohesion
2445073 given that wed only kicked one goal those couple of goals got them three goals and all of a sudden they were a couple of goals in front matthews said
2445074 on that basis we would have played for another six months and not picked them up that changed the game
2445075 there was plenty of recognition for crawf and goo brent guerra in his 150th game today but more importantly we got the four points that makes it a certainty to finish in the top four which is what were after clarkson said
2445076 now weve had the disappointment of being taken apart on the scoreboard so its going to take all our resilience and our determination to ensure we come up again next week matthews said
2445077 but that indefinable confidence would have to be a little bit shaky over a couple of guys
2445078 ive seen your flag on the marble arch love is not a victory march
2445079 there was a time when you let me know whats real and going on below but now you never show it to me do you
2445080 and remember when i moved in you the holy dark was moving too and every breath we drew was hallelujah
2445081 maybe theres a god above and all i ever learned from love was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

2445135 ich gebe gerald da vollkommen recht der boden wird das kleinste problem sein
2445136 wenn die bl cke sich jetzt auch noch von oben nach unten bewegen w rden w re es ein
2445137 hallo kann mir mal jemand sagen ob das auch mit der weckfunktion klappt handy soll als
2445138 naja es g be noch die m glichkeit sich sowas st ck f r st ck selber zu drucken und
2445139 genial schade dass ich mir vor 2 woche grad neue candies gekauft hab
2445140 under the instigation and encouragement of a small group of people
2445141 but i think itll fit right in with what hes got planned
2445142 just as long as i dont get hit in the forehead with an errant balloon or anything like that
2445143 we come to the state fair every year we camp here its just a mom and daughter night out kind of fun
2445144 he makes it ok to be a christian not a lot of people do that
2445145 when you get those things mixing together in the air youve got to be careful
2445146 its not an easy answer but my husband says god will provide
2445147 its probably unrealistic to think they all will be bought out
2445148 its basically a well built house but its in the wrong zone the flood zone
2445149 ill go with something simpler something open with not a lot of expense
2445150 i will be an active fiscally responsible voice that will work to ensure that our families have the jobs health care schools and public safety necessary to succeed
2445151 i love to dance and have a good time here
2445152 im an east sider and you have to be amongst them to understand them cunningham said
2445153 i wish i could run into my high school sweetheart
2445154 i always look for him and id love to connect with him again as friends
2445155 i enjoy watching the girls dance and i pull out my cowboy hat just for the fair
2445156 we have a current donated leave policy that covers employees anyway
2445157 but it normally doesnt kick in if you have time on the books
2445158 it will take a lot of the burden off of those who need to take time off work to recuperate after donating an organ
2445159 if it was for profit i wouldnt have any room to cry
2445160 we went over our heads and booked too many bands
2445161 the plan made it clear it was preliminary and subject to change
2445162 the choices facing the school district three years ago were difficult but an honest disagreement over a policy decision and claims of illegality are two very different things
2445163 because people start to question why golf courses are an essential service we should be providing
2445164 i feel a little uncomfortable knee jerk moving ahead just because we have a financial situation
2445165 we had the only public course in the black in the state of iowa at the time we did this but we also saw that professionals in the field would know more about all aspects of golf operations than we do
2445166 the show is very important to iowa because it demonstrates that the state pays attention to creative expression if we do that i think we can solve some of the economic development issues and other challenges were facing these days
2445167 its open to the public anybody can come and the entry fee 6 per item is so low that almost everyone can afford it
2445168 i say to the judges you choose the best work
2445169 heinicke said in the fan cooled gallery where visitors wandered among paintings drawings and three dimensional works
2445170 i was thinking ok maybe an honorable mention but when i walked in and saw my piece hanging front and center i kind of freaked out this is my sixth year and i just moved up to the adult division so it was just a big shock
2445171 when my kids were home we did everything we had a horse in the horse barn and a dog in the competition we entered cakes pies posters everything imaginable but this is my first ribbon
2445172 its fine with me as long as its condition based
2445173 the agreement im sure will be condition based and the fact is that we have succeeded and were winning and whenever you win wars the troops come home
2445174 the major point here is that senator obama said it wouldnt work couldnt work and still refuses to acknowledge that it has succeeded
2445175 senator obama believes it is not in our strategic interest to have an open ended commitment in iraq that is why he has advocated for a safe and responsible draw down over 16 months
2445176 a clear time frame is the best way to pressure the iraqis to make the political concessions necessary to stabilize iraq for the long term
2445177 my mission and my job as president of the united states one of them will be to make sure that every market in the world is open to your products
2445178 his strengths are his experience his understanding of the military
2445179 thats a public service announcement its not an energy policy
2445180 i was so adamant that he was a very authentic person
2445181 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2445182 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2445183 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2445184 we like elizabeth we like john we wanna see them on the white house lawn
2445185 the kids got off elizabeth got off and im looking at this family and i just fell in love with them
2445186 thats why people like me were so devoted to him in 2004 and 2008
2445187 you still have hope but there will be a place for his ideas and those issues
2445188 i feel sad for his family i feel personally sorry for him but i dont blame him
2445189 hes a very powerful articulate handsome guy and i dont feel surprised that he had an affair
2445190 to be honest with you im disappointed but with the understanding that people are human and as such people are going to make mistakes its one that john is going to have to live with and one that he and his family will have to deal with
2445191 i dont know whether thats going to end any political life for john thats yet to be seen there are a lot of politicians that have made mistakes in their lives and theyve admitted that and they have moved on as how it affects john will ultimately be decided by the voting public
2445192 aha bist du also auch ein dummkopf wenn du verlierst
2445193 nee das war auch nicht unfreundlich das war italienisch und hei t du hast schlecht gespielt
2445194 there are no indications of any kind of foul play
2445195 we dont know exactly what happened but we dont think its suspicious
2445196 over the years community shield matches have been between ourselves
2445197 they are not easy to play against especially at their own ground and when you look at the progression in their team we know it will not be an easy game
2445198 harry brought peter crouch into his squad so you can see the direction of the partnership with defoe
2445199 those two will be a handful for anyone hopefully we can cope
2445200 we have the technology we can rebuild her thinner more pert sexier than before
2445201 the top four have enormous resources but over time it must be possible to compete with them
2445202 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2445203 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2445204 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2445205 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2445206 sebagai calon atau wakil presiden harus mempunyai visi misi secara benar memperjuangkan rakyat dan memperbaiki indonesia lebih baik dari sekarang
2445207 akhir 2008 nanti akan saya kumpulkan seluruh kyai ulama nu untuk membicarakan perbaikan dalam tubuh nu yang berimbas pada ukhuwah antar jamaah
2445208 the stated goal of the visit was to arrange for the coordination between iraq and bin laden and establish camps in falluja nasiriya and iraqi kurdistan under the leadership of abdul aziz
2445209 in march 1998 after bin ladins commission spelling public fatwa against the united states two al qaeda members reportedly went to iraq to meet with iraqi intelligence in july an iraqi delegation traveled to afghanistan to meet first with the taliban and then with bin ladin sources reported that one or perhaps both of these meetings were apparently arranged through bin ladins egyptian deputy zawahiri who had ties of his own to the iraqis
2445210 on one occasion we gave them 10 million swiss dinars about 700 000
2445211 is an arabic member of our shura our leadership council also
2445212 apparently at military chief muhammed atef s urging finally decided to give al qaeda planner khalid sheik mohammed the green light for the 9 11 operation
2445213 with the seriousness of the bedouin of the desert about the way he will try to bomb the pentagon after he destroys the white house
2445214 will strike america on the arm that is already hurting i
2445215 will curse the memory of frank sinatra every time he hears his songs
2445216 there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messenger
2445217 its a very strong affirmation and a high tribute to dr beasleys leadership and the traditions of the university
2445218 we have signed a three year agreement with options to extend to move our bluefield base to the raleigh county memorial airport in the beckley area
2445219 we met and talked to some hospitals in the beckley and mercer county areas about our move and i think everyone understands why we are doing this
2445220 we are in the process of going to the emergency medical service groups and other hospitals over the next few weeks to let them know what we are doing
2445221 we have been looking at this move for the past eight months
2445222 this move allows us to reduce costs and reduce flight time averages the raleigh county memorial airport is also at a higher elevation which helps us with fog issues we were having in bluefield
2445223 well be able to reduce that to 1 3 hours
2445224 they may not sound like much but when you look at the increased fuel and other costs it made complete sense to make this move we will continue to support southeast west virginia but we will be able to do a better job of completing our mission volume at a much lower cost
2445225 the helicopters operation will be 24 hours a day seven days a week
2445226 even with that level of experience the orientation program for new crew members exceeds 200 hours
2445227 we are very excited about healthnet bringing its medical helicopter service to this airport
2445228 when it comes to medical care every minute counts and we think our airport will assist them in being able to transport even more patients that need their services
2445229 for the remaining flights our teams respond directly to the scene of an accident
2445230 this reflects the attention to detail safety and quality practiced by the flight team and the administrators
2445231 nationally less than 40 percent of air medical organizations achieve this status
2445232 safety of flight and exceptional patient care are healthnets top priorities
2445233 i could get an engine out of a beetle in six minutes put a new clutch in a volkswagen in 21 minutes and install new brakes all the way around in 21 minutes too you just didnt want to be around me when i was working on a bug or i might run over you
2445234 all volkswagens were pretty simple and easy to work on
2445235 they only had a few parts so there wasnt much of them to wear out
2445236 one of them was owned by kevin basconi who is now living in north carolina
2445237 otis e reid jr bought the other one for his business reid belt and rubber company
2445238 they still do jim hamm said that mr reid bought the bug so the technicians could travel together into the coalfields in three man teams to repair or service belts jim said it was a little crowded but worse than that it was mighty cold in the winter
2445239 you can still get a lot of new stuff for the old beetles
2445240 people who restore something take their time about what theyre doing these cars are 51 years old
2445241 we have the highest gas rates and other utility rates by and large with maybe a few exceptions in this entire state
2445242 this is a serious concern to the city board and this administration as you know we have acted as an intervener taking on the gas increase as well as the transfer of the gas company we at this point are working with our city attorney on how we feel we need to deal with these utilities as they come forward with all of these rate increases
2445243 the people here in bluefield need to make our legislators aware of this situation where we are paying more than anyone else
2445244 and we need some attention to this process in charleston
2445245 again we need our people who will be most affected with the coming fall and winter and with fall being not too far it is a critical matter to involve our legislators
2445246 it is a critical matter particularly when you have gas at about 4 a gallon
2445247 staffs initial recommendation will be due around the beginning of october so the administrative law judge can get out the rates to be effective nov 1
2445248 the interim rate would be subject to refund once the administrative law judge comes up with the final decision
2445249 visitors should pay attention to sea conditions in particular depending on tide times
2445250 its just a case of checking your local weather forecast and the tide ties before you do actually go swimming

2445259 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2445260 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2445261 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2445262 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2445287 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2445288 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2445289 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2445290 darunter sind auch tibeter und uiguren von denen wir wissen dass vielen von ihnen alles andere als zum tanzen zumute ist
2445291 die zuschauer im stadion sind bestens gelaunt vielleicht sollte das auch unsere grundhaltung sein
2445292 da sind stimmen laut geworden war das eine gute idee
2445293 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2445294 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2445295 ich bin sicher er saakaschwili wird wieder eine niederlage erleiden

2445298 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2445299 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2445300 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2445304 he was aware of the political compulsions of being a backward economy and a backward society therefore he was willing to take a pragmatic view on many things so we see in him an ideal representative of the cause of social justice who was willing to look at practical possibilities of taking people with diverse perceptions to move the movement of social justice forward

2445330 pada suatu ketika aku pernah jatuh sakit tetapi aku tidak menemukan seorang dokter atau obat penyembuh lalu aku berusaha mengobati dan menyembuhkan diriku dengan surat al fatihah maka aku melihat pengaruh yang sangat menakjubkan aku ambil segelas air zam zam dan membacakan padanya surat al fatihah berkali kali lalu aku meminumnya hingga aku mendapatkan kesembuhan total selanjutnya aku bersandar dengan cara tersebut dalam mengobati berbagai penyakit dan aku merasakan manfaat yang sangat besar kemudian aku beritahukan kepada banyak orang yang mengeluhkan suatu penyakit dan banyak dari mereka yang sembuh dengan cepat

2445370 you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations
2445371 tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another a journey that will bring a new and better day to america because of you tonight i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
2445372 this has been a long campaign and i will be making no decisions tonight
2445373 i want the 18 million americans who voted for me to be respected
2445374 it has been an honor to contest the primaries with him just as it has been an honor to call him my friend
2445375 the american people didnt get to know me yesterday as they are just getting to know senator obama
2445376 our party and our country are better off because of her
2445377 and i am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with hillary rodham clinton
2445378 she said that if its offered she would take it
2445379 if senator obama asked her to be the v p she certainly would accept that
2445380 you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country she will be central to that victory
2445381 when we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty it will be because she worked to help make it happen
2445382 there are many words to describe john mccains attempt to pass off his embrace of george bushs policies as bipartisan and new

2445384 i went to a private high school and there were a lot of korean people there and so i just became friends with them and through that i developed an interest in korea
2445385 i graduated very early and came to korea i was planning on only staying here for vacation and it ended up being a life choice so i live in korea now
2445386 i did a little bit of modeling in the united states for american apparel and then came to korea right after that i didnt really do anything right off the bat i was going back and forth to japan to model i actually debuted in tokyo collection and that was my runway debut
2445387 there is really no typical day here because everyone is busy and does their own thing
2445388 korea is a small country and i understand that but things like money and pay are very low and sometimes none i think that designers separate themselves from the models there are so many models in korea so everyone wants to be a model its kind of hard for people who really have the potential to do well to be successful
2445389 being foreign helps there arent a lot of foreign models in korea also being young is an advantage because im younger than a lot of foreign models here the language is definitely a plus if i didnt speak korean i would not be a freelancing model it helps with issues like pay
2445390 to be alone for a 12 page spread is a big big accomplishment especially for a foreign model
2445391 the boss campaign has gotten me a lot of calls from other countries and having something like hugo boss in my profile allows me to be viewed on a high fashion level because boss is such a fashion icon
2445392 im trying to make a unique korean sound and bring it to another level
2445393 the music scene in korea was much better in the 90s you could hear all kinds of music and artists were taking more chances
2445394 i want to be on the frontier of electronic music in korea
2445395 steven knows every single tic every talent that every girl has he just pulls it out of them
2445396 mine is not a magazine that can be accused of not using black girls
2445397 its so crazy to live in such a narrow narrow place age weight sexuality race every kind of prejudice
2445398 i love the history of fashion obviously and i love old and i tried to get as many of the older girls as i could
2445399 i wanted to say something about weight and im never allowed to do that
2445400 i met toccara and thought shes beautiful whats the deal with her shes great and shes sexy
2445401 franca doesnt realize what shes done for people of color
2445402 it reminds me of yves using all the black models
2445403 they are the powerful people and the advertisers i have asked my advertising clients so many times can we use a black girl they say no
2445404 what they want and what the reality is are two different things
2445405 they are looking around over their shoulders asking is that cool
2445406 it can only be stated by a certain five people and then they go with it
2445407 what dont you get shes a beautiful woman there was no trick to it
2445408 we are using a lot of black models like iman not only the models of today a lot of different girls
2445409 because nobody is using black girls i see so many beautiful girls and they were complaining that they are not used enough
2445410 this idea came about as a reaction to the models of today
2445411 i go to a fashion show and every girl is blond and blue eyed and they all walk the same and look the same
2445412 i thought we needed to break away from this type of thing
2445413 there are so many beautiful black women not being used
2445414 then models did their own interpretations of the fashions they were wearing but now the girls all look alike
2445415 but we sell the same amount if we have naomi campbell on the cover
2445416 if you honestly assessed yourself would you say that you have at least some feelings of racial prejudice
2445417 blind to the consequences of being the wrong color in america today
2445418 addressing the wounds between white feminists and feminists of color
2445419 not that i want to get into whether or not race or gender are bigger barriers
2445420 i m coming from parties and real time creations so what i m used to is a lot of real time creations what i m doing now is video installations that stay longer in time so that people can enjoy them longer but i still want to bring my past experience from parties and make these new kinds of installations exciting
2445421 they were completely crazy because they didn t invite me so they wanted to know more about me
2445422 because i think this kind of immersive video installation is really cool
2445423 i m moving on my own trying to meet city officials of big cities around the world
2445424 i was here for two months making my installation and not once was i invited to gallery openings or other artistic events
2445425 koreans right now are stronger in electronic designs video games and animation maybe i m wrong but korea is really young now they have the time and money to think about art you can feel it here it s exciting there are so many young people seems like there are young guys and girls running around
2445426 i m really happy to be in korea i love korea it s not easy but i m pleased to be here because there is a lot of energy here
2445427 in the early days of rap conventional wisdom was that only black people were supposed to like hip hop and only white people were supposed to like rock
2445428 of the top six or seven crews in the world id say half of them are from korea
2445429 black music was considered illegal because it was not good for the youth the only music allowed was folk music
2445430 the music scene itself died influential music makers left the country
2445431 the curiosity began and people became hungry for the real thing
2445432 we know theres always somebody trying to catch up with us
2445433 what happens is they practice on the lowdown until theyre up at a level where they can actually come out and shock somebody
2445434 weve been praised for our technical skills but thats because we would practice head spinning all day long thats what sets us apart
2445435 you know how rivers flow rivers flow swiftly and thats also how we move and how we think
2445436 b boys in other countries do it as a hobby but to the korean b boys our life is b boying
2445437 for me growing up in the states i had been called all kinds of names
2445438 kind of dissolved all that racial bullshit i grew up with
2445439 a year later i came back and i just saw there were more b boys
2445440 im watching it and its the radiotron video that i brought out a year ago its been dubbed so many times the screen is shaking
2445441 the minute youre born in korea depending on what your economic background is or who your parents are what network youre in what neighborhood youre in what high school you went to what college you went to your life is pretty much decided for you
2445442 the b boys its not like theyre the most highly educated kids but theyre good at what they do and they put as much effort into practicing as the other kids do into the korean sats
2445443 if theyre not in college they have to do some kind of menial job
2445444 the service will come up when youre 21 22 but they can always extend that using some excuse
2445445 a lot of the b boys now theyre like 26 27 they havent gone they have to go soon they keep putting it off because the culture is kind of peaking now
2445446 the world is a big place man and theres another hungry competitor stepping up
2445447 its a cycle and the cycle is based upon crews like these korean crews who go out and inspire these new fans and then five years from now those new people are going to be saying ok

2445474 we had newer tracks here that we just wanted to get done at one point and it felt stupid waiting for things to happen
2445475 after a while you were trudging through all these samples looking for something to fit and you say why am i doing it like this this is stupid
2445476 so instead of basing the melodies on samples we started writing our own melodies on the keyboards we had the clarinet player and accordion player reproduce those tracks
2445477 the film deals with the costs of hyper consumption and allows the viewers to understand where their goods are coming from making a connection between themselves their tv and the factory work in mexico
2445478 that more than three fourths of the doubling in deaths along the southwest border since 1995 can be attributed to increases in deaths occurring in the arizona desert
2445479 a unprecedented increase in the number of deaths each year among unauthorized border crossers in the deserts and mountains of southern arizona
2445480 to put this death toll in perspective the fortified us border with mexico has been more than 10 times deadlier to migrants from mexico during the past nine years than the berlin wall was to east germans throughout its 28 year existence
2445481 we did believe that geography would be an ally to us it was our sense that the number of people crossing the border through arizona would go down to a trickle once people realized what its like

2445484 apple pulled the app yesterday without giving my sic any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it

2445489 apple runs the app store so youll have to ask them about the availability of this and other apps
2445490 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capabilities at amp t has a number of other options to choose from
2445491 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all nullrivers dan told wired
2445492 i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it
2445493 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2445494 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down

2445506 agreed but that is the wrong question very few of our clients ever asked for java development either all the client wants is working software that meets his needs certainly i or anyone else that i know for that matter never asked facebook to use erlang for its chat feature
2445507 if you can meet your customers requirements and be competitive with what you already know then by all means do so working as a developer in most software houses is not that demanding after all
2445508 however if you have any aspirations to ever work on a startup like facebook twitter or friendfeed or worse start your own then you might need to work a wee bit harder than that
2445509 btw are you this cautious about all new technologies because i think you were somewhat of an early adopter for jpa

2445569 this collaboration with the ada is an example of how healia is working with trusted nonprofit organizations to help people find relevant information and support in order to make important health decisions
2445570 we hope that people with diabetes or those taking care of someone with diabetes will find the diabetes communities on healia to be essential resources for information and support
2445571 were excited about this opportunity to reach out and help even more people affected by diabetes through our relationship with healia communities
2445572 it allows the american diabetes association to give people personalized answers to their questions about diabetes and really dovetails with our mission to improve the lives of all those affected by diabetes
2445573 prevalence of escherichia coli o157 and o157 h7 infecting bacteriophages in feedlot cattle feces

2445578 novartis is committed to delivering high quality influenza vaccine to help protect more people against this potentially serious and contagious disease
2445579 novartis has made a concerted effort to manufacture and deliver a vaccine that includes these three new strains in the most efficient manner
2445580 despite the new composition novartis made sure we were able to deliver a timely and robust supply of influenza vaccine this year

2445585 behavioral hiv prevention works some have been pessimistic that its possible to reduce hiv risk behaviors on a large scale but this concern is misplaced
2445586 we should not confuse the difficulty in changing human behavior with the inability to do so
2445587 in the 21st century reducing risky sex and drug use is absolutely essential for slowing hiv especially since a vaccine or microbicide could take far longer than hoped
2445588 when it comes to reducing hiv risk behaviors a one size fits all approach doesnt work
2445589 that said the successful efforts we reviewed share striking similarities they deliver a combination of proven strategies reflect local needs and circumstances and are widely accessible to those at risk
2445590 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
2445591 the headboard bangs on the wall as they are having sex and it keeps me awake all night i have had to take days off work because of the lack of sleep
2445592 it started with people looking in the window and making comments outside and they told me their points of view that they found it offensive
2445593 other shop traders also told me that people were saying to them that it was offensive and that i should cover her up or move her
2445594 so i put a camisole on emily and someone else made another comment
2445595 all members of the public and media are invited to attend
2445596 one of parliaments core objectives is to enhance the participation of the public in the processes of parliament the publics access to the institution and its members

2445598 there was no evacuation of governmental buildings in tbilisi and there are no plans for decreeing martial law

2445605 the opening ceremony was a display of chinas achievements and its culture and civilization after the olympics china might be more arrogant or more modest taiwan has little choice but to wait for chinas goodwill
2445606 china compromised to avoid taiwan teams boycotting the games and creating an international incident but it is unlikely that china will be lenient to taiwan on the issue of taiwans seeking international space
2445607 beijing olympics will boost chinas self confidence and expand its global influence will china be more flexible and loosen its grasp on key issues with taiwan there arent such signs yet
2445608 but we hope a more self confident china is more willing to seek understanding and reconciliation with taiwan
2445609 by asking for diplomatic truce and freezing arms purchases from the us taiwan has surrendered to china even before the battle began this strategy leans too much towards china and relies too much on chinas goodwill it endangers taiwans security and causes our allies to lose trust in taiwan

2445613 in the 18 19th centuries people tended to punctuate heavily especially in their use of commas
2445614 excessive punctuation was common in the 18th century at its worst it used commas with every subordinate clause and separable phrase

2445658 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2445659 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2445660 i think they need to work through that process of healing
2445661 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2445662 mad she was angry furious would be a good way to describe it

2445673 how did i know and how long did i know about it
2445674 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2445675 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2445676 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2445677 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2445678 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2445679 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2445680 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2445681 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2445682 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2445683 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2445684 i am launching my campaign for next election my party will contest 80 seats in uttar pradesh which means ajit is out there is no pact with him
2445685 when a dalit girl heads the most populated state of up four times and the fourth time with the sole support of her own party then why cant this dalit girl head the country as the pm

2445690 we plant trees we sow seeds the land turns green

2445692 many of our islands are threatened by rising sea levels

2445694 we cannot estimate the total cost as we dont know how severe the impact will be it is already not possible to grow cotton and maize in some areas how much the losses will be is harder to say
2445695 but the procedures are complicated africa is already behind in attracting foreign direct investment the same problems stand in the way of cdm projects
2445696 its a major flaw developed countries need to reduce their emissions by 90 we need more drastic action market forces alone cannot deliver the reductions needed markets caused the problem in the first place
2445697 most adaptation finance will have to come via development aid it must become mainstreamed into the development process
2445698 when africa only has 30 cdm projects out of 1 000
2445699 we urge the public not to use their discretion in this regard but to consult with their medical practitioners immediately

2445702 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2445703 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2445704 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2445705 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2445706 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2445707 what is going on is a massive bombardment of residential quarters in tshkinvali and other towns too
2445708 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2445709 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now

2445712 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2445713 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2445714 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2445715 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2445716 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2445717 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2445718 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2445719 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2445720 if you look at a power station clearly there are many many areas where theres large scale machinery working they are very tall structures

2445793 in europe it is not unusual for a vw golf or opel astra to cost 29 000 euros
2445794 i would have to say that this is probably at the top end of things not to do to your body
2445795 its very demanding on the body every day you come in and some days you dont want to be in here you have to push yourself through those days
2445796 thats the only way i know how to do it dive in head first and lets see what happens
2445797 ive got to do the right things and capitalize business wise too every second that goes by im not getting any younger
2445798 this sport will spell the demise of boxing it already has eclipsed it in pay per view in viewership the young people are growing up with this sport this is what they watch theyre training in this sport theyre not training to be boxers i think the next generation coming up is going to be phenomenal its going to be something that we havent seen yet in this sport the skill level is going to keep getting better and better
2445799 look at boxing its still here to stay and its been around for many years everythings got its ups and downs and right now were at the peak right now business is good for me obviously i dont fight for peanuts and i dont think anybody wants to this is prize fighting
2445800 i wanted to take fighting seriously to do that i had to become a wrestler
2445801 but this is absolutely not just a payday to me
2445802 if you look at this from the beginnings to where ufc kind of changed it became really a sport you see these guys now doing it nearly for free at the level i compete its out of love the money isnt there like in the nfl or in boxing so guys who do this do it because they love it
2445803 i think it will be the biggest sport the world has ever seen i truly believe that
2445804 this is a return to the gladiator days but on a global level some of the best fighters in the world are from russia and brazil theyre bringing all their intensity together i can see it just blowing up because theres nothing more entertaining its pure competition
2445805 to an extent its generational but my dad watches it closely i know
2445806 i think just the excitement factor that comes with it its so appealing to people if you watch some of those fights anything can happen one guy can be totally dominant look at brocks last fight he was totally dominant but it didnt end that way
2445807 thats what draws so many people in anything can happen at any time
2445808 everybody understands fighting one guy gets hit that guy goes down theres no scoring system one guy hits one guy falls
2445809 men women you look at some of the people in the stands the girls show up girls have been showing up for boxing forever theres women boxing theres women wrestling and theres women fighting
2445810 so i think its something where its new and its exciting and people can understand it i think thats why pro wrestling got so intriguing to people one guy is good one guy is bad thats how you walk through life every day gosh i dont like that guy i wish i could everybody has somebody they dislike
2445811 what the hell went on in here mark i just saw angela coming out of here and i knew there was no class here now so thats why i came in wondering why the hell she was in here know i can tell what went on in here and you know that type of thing isnt allowed on school grounds
2445812 now this is a really awkward situation and i dont really know what to do here so mark maybe youve got some suggestions huh
2445813 well miss i really dont know maybe you could just forget it
2445814 we didnt even do what you most likely think we did she just we
2445815 just she was just giving me oral its not like we were in here having wild s sex or anything its not as bad as you think
2445816 not as bad as i think oral sex is still sex and it was still done on school grounds and its not allowed i dont care if you fucked her brains out or if she sucked you off or whatever
2445817 no dont be i deserve the shouting and everything you have every right to be mad just please dont tell anybody
2445818 christ mark fine but i swear i never want to even hear about anything like that going on i have to get back to the teachers lounge and you go on wherever you have to go
2445819 listen mark we need to talk about your performance in class youve been doing fairly bad i know youve gotten accepted to college already and thats why you think you can slack off now am i right
2445820 yeah you got me miss im really sorry but i didnt think i was doing so terrible in this class ill try harder i really will
2445821 will you i dont think you will do you even understand what were talking about in class whenever i look over at you you seem to be either day dreaming or talking to your friends i think you need some tutoring in english
2445822 wha i dont need tutoring in english its english for gods sake id have to be a retard not to understand the subject
2445823 i understand how you feel but try to see where im coming from i dont like seeing kids as bright as you do so poorly and i do this very rarely im willing to tutor you myself after school
2445824 great im proud of you mark we can start tomorrow meet me after this period in the library theres nobody there at that point so itll be nice and quiet
2445825 i think you need some sort of motivation and i understand that

2445856 with the singles market gradually dying and changes to singles charts this could be the last chance for cliff to achieve his sixth decade ambition
2445857 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2445858 its another attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid a trial on the charges of attempted murder in violation of the laws of war conspiracy providing material support for terrorism and spying
2445859 we have no intention of deviating from the course that were on
2445860 our position is the same as the previous liberal governments position that mr khadr should face these charges through a judicial process not a political one and certainly not a media one
2445861 were getting down to the point where omar has been in guantanamo for upwards of six years and we think its high time this proceeding was brought

2445867 i suspect after youve had numerous busts somebodys future plan for growing pot in vineyards is going to be thwarted
2445868 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2445869 the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2445870 now that there is talk that georgia and ukraine might join nato at some point i think russia which has significantly reasserted itself on the world stage has said point blank that this will not happen
2445871 russias voice has been ignored many times by the west on nato expansion on kosovo on iraq and i think this time russia is determined because this is on the russian border and russia assumes that this is a territory where russia has very serious interests
2445872 people are there without water food electricity they cant leave their shelters
2445873 his doctor visited him last night and said he has to have a little operation but it is not serious
2445874 we dont want mauritania to be isolated we want mauritania to return to the fold
2445875 im getting a little more comfortable kind of realizing how i have to pitch up here
2445876 im just trying to get my feet wet and every time out i feel like im getting a little bit better
2445877 they hit a good slider down i made a mistake to shin soo choo and then tried to come back with a changeup and they put it into the gap
2445878 i made a couple of good pitches and some bad pitches thats just the way it goes
2445879 i was trying to get my off speed over a little bit more than i was early i was trying to mix some other stuff in there to keep them off balance but in the end i left a couple of them over the plate
2445880 as far as purcey hes getting there he kept us in the game
2445881 were going to be patient with him and hope he learns something every time out
2445882 to me the last two games i thought he pitched pretty well
2445883 if he stays on top of that ball hes got a pretty good fastball so yeah i think hes getting better
2445884 tom rang to say he was coming home and asked if he could he speak to his mum
2445885 she then handed me an envelope and told me tom said it was ok to give this to me now
2445886 there was the season ticket with a note saying that was for all the tickets id bought him at stoke since he was seven or eight i was emotional anyway thinking that tom was coming home and that was amazing ive got tom a ticket for the villa game as well so that is going to be absolutely brilliant
2445887 i told tom him he didnt have to stick with stoke but he has done and it has been nice to have someone to share the burden with
2445888 it is going to be difficult this season but i just hope everyone gets behind the team and enjoys the rollercoaster ride
2445889 they were looking for leaflets which we dont do and signs which we do but we have federal express
2445890 he loved soccer football motorbikes and generally anything that would get him into dirt and trouble

2445892 sama seperti orang fitnes tiap hari tapi belum bisa jadi binaragawan
2445893 and were off to an exciting start with more scoring fewer penalties and plenty of close and exciting games
2445894 to me it doesnt matter what your age is its what you can do and what youre interested in and what youre capable of accomplishing i think people make too much of age
2445895 so if we do have some sort of even short term disruption to the supply side i wouldnt be surprised to see people opportunistically pushing spot prices higher
2445896 there are no words to describe it i expected a lot but this exceeded my dreams
2445897 the process i was put through is a warning to journalists who would defy radical islam
2445898 i get nervous because its game time you can get as much as you put in
2445899 i think people would look at this and say wow an indian film exotic location it looks really interesting why dont we go see what this is about and then you find its about you
2445900 i think when youre in a place that does seem exotic youre willing to suspend your disbelief a bit more
2445901 one guy e mailed me right after the san francisco festival and said that based on feelings the movie evoked he went home and proposed to his girlfriend
2445902 i said to richie at the first couple of events last year this is weird were actually allowed to be here but now we have this go get it type of attitude and nothing can stop that
2445903 the idea was we want to appeal to the art house crowd but also the indian suburban crowd

2445911 some countries dont have enough need for airlift to purchase their own c 17s

2445913 the c 17 was designed around the cargo load it can convert to airline or cargo seats it can handle a combination of passengers vehicles track vehicles cargo medical evacuations hummers fire trucks helicopters an abrams tank up to 80 000 metric tons
2445914 initially there will only be us personnel manning the c 17s
2445915 but with training the countries will be able to use their own pilots crew aircraft commanders and loadmasters it will take a year and a half to train the countries crew and for them to be comfortable with the c 17 to fly on their own
2445916 the availability of this kind of technology for single engine airplanes is revolutionizing general aviation
2445917 synthetic vision gps waas and safe taxi are among the most important advancements in avionics technology to come along in decades
2445918 the addition of synthetic vision technology to our fleet means mooney will retain its accustomed position as the industrys leaders in value and performance
2445919 because the g1000 is a truly integrated and expandable system all of its major components are designed and manufactured by a single company so that they work together to give pilots the complete picture
2445920 svt was designed as a retrofittable system and we have worked closely with mooney to develop a process whereby customers can add svt to their aircraft with very little downtime

2446001 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
2446002 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
2446003 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

2446055 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2446056 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2446057 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2446058 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2446059 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2446060 i should have known that people would feel that way
2446061 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2446062 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2446063 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go

2446072 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2446073 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2446074 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2446075 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2446076 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2446077 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2446078 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2446079 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2446080 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2446081 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2446082 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2446083 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2446084 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2446085 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2446086 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2446087 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2446088 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2446089 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2446090 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live

2446097 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2446098 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2446099 knowing who im dating and what kind of cereal i eat aint gonna benefit anybody else that kind of thing is not important
2446100 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private
2446101 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later

2446110 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2446111 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them

2446159 you insolent godless dunderhead what harm did the pools and the water do to you see now you also shall wither like a tree and shall bear neither leaves nor root nor fruit
2446160 from where does this child spring since his every word is an accomplished deed
2446161 since you have such a child you cannot dwell with us in the village or else teach him to bless and not to curse for he is slaying our children
2446162 why do you do such things that these people must suffer and hate us and persecute us
2446163 i know that these words are not yours nevertheless for your sake i will be silent but they shall bear their punishment
2446164 the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god

2446168 youre placing the words of paul above the words of jesus

2446180 everywhere i went in the racist movement the confederate flag was flown often times we hear or have been told that the confederate flag has to do with heritage that is does white privilege a heritage that enslaved people and exploited people all in the name of white supremacy and the confederacy today in the 21st century racist organizations know that marching and waving the swastika isnt cool however waving the confederate flag is still acceptable to many in many ways the confederate flag has become the 21st century version of the swastika the swastika didnt start out as a racist symbol of evil its origins are as a symbol of peace and well being over the years it became known and seen as a symbol of hate like the confederate flag
2446181 at aryan nations i was taught what the confederate flag represented 13 stars represented the 13 lost tribes of white israel red was purity of blood white was the color of our skin
2446182 its almost impossible for a politician and particularly a republican to not know about the council of conservative citizens scandal because of what the head of their own party said i cant say whats in each of these politicians heads but i think some politicians are simply pandering to white supremacists for political support

2446218 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2446219 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2446220 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2446221 can the vpn client cisco work with nortel vpn router
2446222 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2446223 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2446224 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2446225 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2446226 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2446230 its a good festival but we should be headlining over scouting for girls who i noticed are playing
2446231 it would be right for us to top the bill maybe scotland has thousands more people who love scouting for girls but we are a much better band
2446232 if the people in scotland think we are one of their favourite bands from england im not worried about what scouting for girls think
2446233 we should be headlining because scouting for girls write good pop songs and do really well but they just write hits and it sounds like they are writing the same song over and over theyre a good band and nice guys but its not my thing
2446234 when you consider how many people are affected by hiv and aids it makes you realise that while there have been huge medical breakthroughs in treatment we still need to keep education and information in the spotlight
2446235 we have a fantastic opportunity to do this with malachys storyline as its a relevant and very much a real life issue
2446236 before reading the scripts i was unaware of the medical developments made to help people living with hiv
2446237 there are a lot of myths surrounding this issue and we are hoping to dispel quite a few but at the same time tell a very heartfelt story of two brothers on a frightening journey together

2446243 i probably did but dont be deceived by the bandages it doesnt reflect the wound claire was playing nurse
2446244 except when she plays nurse what have you been doing today
2446245 answering the phone a lot all the papers have been calling the washington post ws the last one i told them all about it i told them how you punched in the face of that son of a bitch
2446246 maybe i ought to let you handle my public relations
2446247 all the kids at school know about it i was really proud of you dad
2446248 thanks besides dealing with the press what else have you been doing
2446249 i had a very interesting experience i think it was spiritual i went with aaron to his bar mitzvah class with rabbi moreheim
2446250 i dont know i was wondering if theyre not just yours
2446251 if we as jews created god then there must be one if not in the flesh then in our souls and in our hearts
2446252 you always said that man created god and not the other way around all right so man did create god and when he finished he had god if you make a book shelf then you got a book shelf its real its there and the same with god you make god you got god
2446253 i dont know im not sure aaron doesnt have any problems with it he says its comfortable and he just leaves it there hes a jew and im a jew but we dont seem to be in the same place aaron speaks hebrew his father speaks hebrew its supposed to be our holy language i dont speak a word of it just shalom when we were in israel i said shalom and they said shalom back and when it was saturday they said shalom shabbat and i didnt know enough to say shabbat shalom
2446254 im a jew but why what do i do with it i know grandpa was in the war and he fought for israel and grandma too grandpas friend was killed in the war of independence and he wasnt even jewish and grandpa anad grandma planted a forest for him in israel and im named after him but what have i done what am i mom doesnt even light the candles on friday night
2446255 sure but its not just that its a lot of things there are a lot of things i dont understand dad maybe you can explain them to me well talk about it i want to get my thoughts together
2446256 i always felt something was missing i dont know what exactly but today with aaron and rabbi moreheim i felt maybe here it was
2446257 shes in the den i think shes kind of worried
2446258 id better have a word with her and tell her theres nothing to worry about
2446259 on sinais lofty mountain paces from america to israel evoking many of the more controversial aspects of modern jewish identity among them zionism conversion and responses to anti semitism
2446260 the treatment of israeli history has an authentic ring and testifies to painstaking research by du broff whose marriage of fact and fiction is handled on the whole soundly
2446261 i feel remarkably good bill now im sorry i didnt hit him again
2446262 i dont think the defense department will want to become directly involved they wouldnt want to appear too obvious
2446263 ill stop off at the range and get in some target practice
2446264 claire please hurry up ive got a lot of work to do
2446265 i thought i had escaped the perils of a jewish mother and this one isnt even jewish
2446266 im not saying theres anything wrong with being able to hit the target but under the circumstances you may very well be the target they will get in the first salvo and there wont be any opportunity for you to reply
2446267 we know the defense department occupies an inordinately high place in this country too much so they are the tail that wags the american dog
2446268 it will serve notice on them that we are taking the behavior of one of their employees with the utmost gravity we are the ones issuing the complaint and it might he useful to notify the press we have nothing to hide and i think it could be useful protection for you
2446269 i also think that this brady thing has some very deep implications the defense department knows something we dont know a lot warton probably reflected that
2446270 how was i ever lucky enough to have a son like you
2446271 because i was lucky enough to have a father like you
2446272 this is not a book that any zionist can just read and then criticize one dives into this book and swims in it sinks flounders and finishes in one piece if one is lucky
2446273 hes that rotten little jew bastard over at naval intelligence all those rotten jews are traitors theyll sell out to israel every day of the week too bad hitler didnt get them all
2446274 ill get you if its the last thing i ever do
2446275 get me get me now you son of a bitch
2446276 get out of my restaurant and dont ever come back you scum of the earth
2446277 get this man out of here throw him in the gutter
2446278 i found it very interesting it certainly will alert readers to jonathan pollards problem but in some ways what i found even more interesting was the way in which you described the challenges tensions and possiblities within inter faith marriages it was a book that i very much wanted to read to the end
2446279 i could have said and even gone so far as to say
2446280 i suppose that might have something to do with it
2446281 youre feeling isolated as a jew and the person closest to you is a gentile
2446282 of course im part of you my love you are jewish i am jewish what you are i am its never been any other way i wouldnt want it any other way weve been through this before a long time ago i thought it was settled
2446283 maybe it was just in abeyance maybe it was dormant because it didnt matter so much then now i feel its imperative
2446284 logically yes theres never been any doubt emotionally i dont think so i feel that youre holding back something something you wont give all the way
2446285 i would sooner die than hurt you do you believe that
2446286 i cant be a part of your history and your culture no matter how much i study and understand it if we were religious people perhaps i would see it differently but we hve always shared our non religious faith we have always had that in common christianity is not my religion any more than judaism is yours
2446287 judaism isnt my religion but its my life what i am all that has gone before
2446288 no one is denying that your son is jewish its his culture and his history i come from the outside i have joined up with you i am your ally in life in everything that you do i would like to be jewish i would like your history to be mine your culture to be ours i am the one who has been deprived in many ways perhaps in a jewish milieu where i was part of it working with it and in it i would have a different perspective but we never have lived in that milieu your commitment is historical and cultural and perhaps for you that is sufficient but for me i founder it cant mean the same thing for me that it does for you i think that someone in my position has to be involved in it has to earn the right to be jewish
2446289 but the isolation remains at least a part of me you feel remains in the enemy camp
2446290 i have had the opportunity to go over the book and was impressed by the objectivity of the writer mr du broffs efforts on behalf of the pollards as well as his well earned reputation as an author ensure that readers will enjoy this excellent novel
2446291 so i understand its clairs work if it was up to her id be in splints i can take most of it off now now that shes not around
2446292 shes in love with you mark dont be too hard on her
2446293 i dont believe it she must have loads of boy friends shes a remarkable woman i dont know what id do without her shes as involved with this report on the american condition as i am
2446294 i am i dont believe the department of defense is very happy at the moment i expect theyre going to try and retaliate the best thing we can do is get all the publicity we can if the press wants to talk to you you sure do want to talk to them the way i see it its a kind of insurance policy
2446295 im not sure the department of defense wouldnt prefer to ignore the whole thing
2446296 maybe but will warton i dont think he will and i think hell involve defense as much as hes able which brings me to the second point theres someting going on here defense is involved but its bigger than that and it smells worse than any skunk thats been hit on the road mark its to do with alan brady there are a lot of things theyre not telling us here why was he spying for israel
2446297 i assume israel has spies around just like we do
2446298 but why did israel need to thats my point i would have assumed that israel and the united states have some sort of mutual arrangement regarding the pooling of information dont they did they ever have did it come unstuck
2446299 its obviously an incident thats embarrassing to both sides my guess is that they will both choose to ignore it
2446300 except that it wouldnt have made the headlines washington would have waved a finger at israel and said dont do it again and we wouldnt know anything about alan brady if they were preparead to overlook it
2446301 an overt shift in policy regarding israel and an attack on american jews
2446302 jews have a way of ignoring unpleasant facts in the hope that they will go away but they never do
2446303 could be the incident today has a lot to do with it and you sure as heck shouted fire not that im saying theres anything wrong with what you did that bastard really got what he deserved
2446304 this book seems to have everything in it memories of vietnam echoes of the holocaust drama from the establishment of the state of israel intermarriage even immigration and much more

2446356 mon avis est quon ne peut cr er des personnages que lorsque lon a beaucoup tudi les hommes comme on ne peut parler une langue qu la condition de lavoir s rieusement apprise
2446357 in my opinion it is impossible to create characters until one has spent a long time in studying men as it is impossible to speak a language until it has been seriously acquired not being old enough to invent i content myself with narrating and i beg the reader to assure himself of the truth of a story in which all the characters with the exception of the heroine are still alive
2446358 i do not draw from this story the conclusion that all women like marguerite are capable of doing all that she did far from it but i have discovered that one of them experienced a serious love in the course of her life that she suffered for it and that she died of it i have told the reader all that i learned it was my duty
2446359 mon avis est quon ne peut cr er des personnages que lorsque lon a beaucoup tudie les hommes comme on ne peut parler une langue qu la condition de lavoir s rieusement apprise
2446360 diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve i do not know it the result will be as agreeable as you describe but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say

2446362 then only dartagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty her constantly meeting him in the antechamber the corridor or on the stairs those touches of the hand every time she met him and her deep sighs but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady he had disdained the soubrette he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of the sparrow

2446368 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2446369 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2446370 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2446371 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2446372 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2446373 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2446374 she is the breadwinner and looks after her grandchildren she told us her pension grant was not enough to provide for her and her grandchildren
2446375 we were shocked to find out that such an old woman was responsible for such an offence
2446376 police officers working with the dare programme have issued this warning if you are driving after dark and see an oncoming car with no headlights on do not flash your lights at them this is a bloods gang member initiation game
2446377 the new gang member under initiation drives with no headlights and the first car to flash their headlights at him is now his target he is required to turn around and chase that car then shoot and kill every individual in the vehicle in order to complete his initiation requirements
2446378 anyone who may have taken drugs from these batches should see a doctor as a short inadvertent exposure to nevirapine might render the individual resistant to nevirapine therefore eliminating nevirapine as a future treatment option

2446382 it was not something where we were like alright guys thats it weve done all we can its time to shut the door and move on it was just circumstances that worked out in such a way that we went our diferent paths but we always left the door open that if ever the opportunity arose that we could get some work together then sure why not
2446383 but fortunately there is the internet and we trade a lot of files over the net
2446384 well be doing more vocals when basti comes back and since we dont tour anymore there is a lot more time to work on this album
2446385 we have a number of songs that lack vocals and arrangements but i am happy that well finish this and hopefully youll hear some of it on the radio soon
2446386 it just so happened that with my going back in december the door opened
2446387 and it was a big door and a good door so we started putting our heads together and writing some new material
2446388 who knows if the opportunity arises and we do put this thing together and everything works out and we tour why not id love to tour again
2446389 certain persons of a certain company have been soliciting donations on their website and in the newspapers for the removal of animals from robben island
2446390 in reality we should be cheaper because of petrol shading resulting from petrol subsidies in queensland where unleaded was yesterday selling for as little as 1 33
2446391 this price difference hits our region particularly hard because it is rich in lifestyle and poor in income
2446392 there is so much denial around rising petrol prices and the fact the nrma is gathering evidence and have been so strong on this issue is really good
2446393 this price rise isnt like the price rise for bananas after the cyclone because with bananas people could substitute them with another fruit and understood why the price went up
2446394 with petrol you cant substitute it with anything and its hard to understand the reason for the rise
2446395 its good to see theres so many props in there
2446396 outside backs are out there for show and thats coming from an outside back
2446397 tim deserves to be there hes an absolute gentleman and hes without a doubt the best player playing around here
2446398 we are coming up against a top front row tweed coast
2446399 i might be a bit biased but i wouldnt swap my two front rowers for anyone
2446400 if we win we definitely move up to fourth maybe even third but if we lose we are definitely out
2446401 if you cant beat the good sides at this time of year you deserve to be out youd just be making up the numbers
2446402 we are not far off a really good performance weve been doing it over 60 minutes and letting ourselves down in patches
2446403 but coming up against these top sides you cant afford 10 minutes off
2446404 this is the first time i can remember where i couldnt tell you whos going to win the competition
2446405 byron bay have plateaued a bit like us lower clarence had been playing really well but came back down to earth last week
2446406 grafton ghosts keep winning because they go the 80 minutes theyre a good side theyre not the most talented side but theyre in the box seat whoever goes down there has to play some damn good football to beat them
2446407 it needed to happen a long time ago prior to this theyd be selected by the ais only out of nationals
2446408 so the development they get prior to nationals is probably a lot better through this
2446409 the program is designed to go until 2010 and hopefully to 2012 and athletes that come out hopefully will go to australian trials and get selected in australian teams we do have an athlete there in beijing now
2446410 the rest ill put money on for the end of they year that theyll be national champions or close to it
2446411 arthur maloney has been well known for coaching indigenous boxers for a long time
2446412 what made me enthusiastic about coaching were the indigenous boxers i met under arthur
2446413 but we can see huge potential in the technology and we are working to get it commercialised in the next 12 months
2446414 we wont make money out of permo drive for 12 months so well have to get involved with other things to compensate for that were looking around
2446415 i reckon they are flukes if they go in they go in ive seen plenty of people play good shots that didnt go in
2446416 i had my first one in the year 2000 and by then i had been playing golf for 40 years
2446417 you play a lot of good shots that go close and its a bonus if they do go in a bit of enjoyment
2446418 they were a bit of a distraction to be honest they put you off your game
2446419 ive had a letter from my lawyer where the church says id be forced into the situation of having to sell my home if i continued with the proceedings
2446420 unless he succeeds against our client on all components of his claim he is likely to remain liable for a substantial sum of money
2446421 in light of your clients impecuniosity which means a lack of money and absent substantial recovery and set off he will be unable to meet the taxed proportion of those costs without selling his homestead
2446422 on any view the continuation of these proceedings against the second defendant pell cannot be in the interests of your client
2446423 if the offer set out in this letter is not accepted we will produce this letter to the court in support of an application by our client for whatever costs order is properly then available depending on the outcome of the case
2446424 the archbishop said hed review the matter and create a new panel to look into it but i havent heard anything and im sure anthony hasnt heard anything either

2446430 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2446431 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2446432 they got their freedom back after having been in captivity for a long time the local elders and puntland authorities helped their release
2446433 they are now in bossaso and will be soon flown to their country
2446434 we succeeded in gaining the release of the german hostages late last night after discussing with the kidnappers they are now free
2446435 everything is ok now the situation of the hostages is under control they are safe puntland ministers are controlling the matter

2446449 pulled what appeared to be a body from the van and carried it into the house
2446450 there was also duck brand tape wrapped around the items giving the appearance that something had been wrapped inside them
2446451 one of the blood stains on a recovered blanket matched garcias dna profile
2446452 that her daughter was dead but claimed it was an accident for which hollinquest was responsible
2446453 this may not be the final charges with the case
2446454 until we have conclusive evidence to the contrary it will still be investigated as a missing persons case
2446455 that house is hard to stay in with all the memories
2446456 we are very proud of him and expect him to do well
2446457 everything you do is timed you have to think fast and move quick
2446458 i was curious to find out how well i would do

2446462 un itinerario alla scoperta della filiera del cibo dalla semina alla comprensione della stagionalit dei prodotti alla degustazione
2446463 it was an ideal preparation it was a very pacy game we wanted an intense game and i think ajax gave us more than we wanted they fought for every ball and played well some players are still a bit short physically but im not really concerned we were much better defensively in the second half
2446464 in first half our position on the pitch was not right we changed that at half time and from then on it was much more difficult for ajax to play
2446465 you know arsenal we always create a lot of chances and dont always score all of them but its difficult to complain as well when you score three goals
2446466 in the whole game we were always dangerous going forward but they took advantage of two lapses of concentration and scored two fantastic goals both goals were unstoppable great finishes they were sharp incisive and took advantage of every mistake we made
2446467 we missed nasri tonight who has a little knock we missed diaby and we missed song whos at the olympics i dont know if our midfield tonight was ideal but its certainly not far from the midfield well play wednesday night
2446468 im not concerned about that but i would have been very concerned tonight if we had one or two injuries in midfield we canot afford that at the moment with nasri and diaby out its very positive for us that we have no injuries tonight
2446469 i said many times we are one body short and if you ask me who i cannot answer the question because i dont know more than you
2446470 they have intelligent strikers i was impressed by their efficiency and their movement off the ball and it could be they have a coach who was a striker
2446471 im not too much concerned about the defence because i think we played against a good attack
2446472 installer 4 beta is included it is added in any mode by default the main installer package management interface within pwnagetool isnt enabled yet and will report that installer app isnt available but the actual installer app package is added as a default option in both modes
2446473 i see the bottles when i take the grand kids there on a sunday morning i have to take a towel with me because they pour beer down the banana slide
2446474 there were boys there throwing stones at a nine year old girl the other day
2446475 and sometimes in the cut there are 14 or 15 year olds smoking pot though that is rare
2446476 it makes your heart beat a little faster when you have to walk past a group of youths in the park
2446477 i dont agree with closing the play area why should the little ones go without you should employ someone to keep an eye on it to control it rather than get rid of it you need police walking around getting to know people
2446478 we need people to report every incident these get logged and at the end of the month we can see how many there are in each area so we know where police are most needed and we can show the statistics to government as proof we need more resources
2446479 a lot stems from disrespectful play i think people are less tolerant these days of kids playing in the street while the kids are more confident so if you get someone coming out of their house to talk to them it can escalate
2446480 about 18 500 people have been to see mamma mia in carlisle since it opened a month ago and its not dropping off the sales have been overwhelming
2446481 usually when a film has been on for a couple of weeks we see a drop off of about 25 to 50 per cent but this hasnt happened with mamma mia its just getting bigger and bigger we had about 16 000 ticket sales for indiana jones
2446482 we have pretty much sold all of the 350 seats every night and were getting a lot of people who dont normally come to the cinema they just expect to walk in and see it but weve been having to turn people away
2446483 mamma mia has outsold batman the dark knight and thats got twice as many shows that was supposed to be the summer blockbuster
2446484 we moved mamma mia into the biggest screen we anticipate that we will have it on our screens for another three to four weeks
2446485 its been absolutely manic we didnt realise it was going to be that busy
2446486 it was kind of slow to start with but then word spread and before long it was packed out
2446487 theyre up singing and dancing and its the only film ive known which gets a round of applause at the end

2446489 i dont think its unreasonable to say the temperature got up to 130 degrees
2446490 i think some people think we might get cold but you dont
2446491 it is a big help gas prices are through the roof
2446492 without that i wouldnt have been able to afford to go to school
2446493 occurred in the same area where heavily armed mexican soldiers riding in a humvee shot at a border patrol agent in 2002 a 50 caliber bullet ripped through the agents rear window as he sped away
2446494 its getting harder and harder to get into atlanta because our degree is getting higher and higher ranked
2446495 we just dont have the capacity in atlanta especially the first two years
2446496 its just one of the best bachelors program jobs there is
2446497 it will help to attract more companies to the area knowing that youre tied in with an engineering school
2446498 this investigation is not over and until we know more we have to sit tight
2446499 we need to wait until all the information comes in
2446500 what is there for me to check i dont farm i dont fish
2446501 the only thing i can do is try to clean it up
2446502 its an unfortunate situation but its something i have no control over
2446503 the majority of the pupils that took the remediation passed all their course work
2446504 if we feel like were doing the right thing for the student thats the important thing
2446505 if some parents waited until wednesday or thursday to file an appeal those meetings will spill over into next week
2446506 we wanted to be educated to experience the crisis of hunger and poverty and sickness we just wanted to see it with our own eyes
2446507 we get so bombarded by advertisements that say we need need need
2446508 we really need nothing but what god has given us it really put a theme through the entire record
2446509 itll be different its going to be more of a storytellers where we take the time to talk and share the back story
2446510 ive been a father for a little over a year
2446511 im trying to learn how to be a father and how to balance road life with home life
2446512 im always writing i try to be prepared for when that next record comes
2446513 life is an ever changing thing so well always have something new to talk about theres always something rich there
2446514 i try to rely on the spirit of god and the nudging of him it is really easy to be burned out
2446515 ive always tried to take your approach that isnt typical that isnt mainstream or popular or hot
2446516 ive been a believer about 10 years a bigger percentage of my life was as an unbeliever
2446517 there wasnt a lot of music out that i identified with
2446518 when i became a believer i loved worship and i loved connecting with god theres something universal about it that breaks down walls and barriers
2446519 were trying and were not just trying one thing its a shotgun approach
2446520 it may be a little thing but its a little thing on a large scale
2446521 he just had a baby boy he didnt need to be on the road right now
2446522 i had a lot of fun i learned a lot and grew a lot
2446523 its going to be more scaled down like what people will hear live
2446524 whatever comes out of my heart im going to write i dont want to be pigeonholed as a christian artist
2446525 i want to get a whole new crowd in that can get into the music and theyll eventually see my heart and what im about it doesnt have to have labels on it
2446526 we cant do everything to help them but we can make a difference
2446527 ive got tattoos im a bigger guy its funny to me to go into places and see how people related to bikers
2446528 they hate 6 a m but love 9 oclock theyre already done
2446529 weve seen an increase in drivers switching to motorcycles due to the rise in gas prices
2446530 i started driving a lot more when gas prices started going up
2446531 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2446532 visitors should pay attention to sea conditions in particular depending on tide times
2446533 its just a case of checking your local weather forecast and the tide ties before you do actually go swimming
2446534 i was leaving a lot of my good friends but once i got here i realized this was best for my golf game
2446535 when you have guys like that on your team that are competing against you trying to crack that lineup and theyll still sit there and try to help you
2446536 that just shows the character of the players the character of the school and the character of the coaches and the job they did
2446537 once i stood on that campus i absolutely fell in love with it
2446538 the best move had to be from baton rouge to here
2446539 if i continue to practice and work the way i have i can see myself cracking the lineup
2446540 if i dont crack the lineup and ive been playing really well id be glad for one of those guys to take that spot if they play better
2446541 we have nine 10 guys that can come in this year and just take a spot were so deep that you can put out any lineup and were going to do well
2446542 tonight the hawks organization received an offer sheet from the memphis grizzlies for josh smith
2446543 we are happy to announce that we will match their offer sheet
2446544 ownership management and the team are happy to have josh return as a member of the hawks
2446545 no i cant hang out because i have to study
2446546 this great performance was a brilliant distillation of 5 000 years of glorious history
2446547 china will embrace the world with openness self confidence and warmth
2446548 it started with grim paramilitary goons in blue track suits accompanying the olympic torch on its embarrassing tour of democratic countries
2446549 and now the games begin with broken promises on press freedom and shipping in party members to forcibly replace ordinary chinese hoping to see the torch relay
2446550 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2446551 at a time when tibet darfur and chinas broader human rights record are proving delicate issues for beijing organisers the move to present thousands of drilled sobersided army officers was surprising for its brazenness a none too subtle projection of strength
2446552 all of the military arms have have wonderful acrobats and opera troupes we should make use of such resources
2446553 especially before the lighting of the cauldron my heart was pounding so hard there was only one chance and not a single mistake was allowed
2446554 the world wants to see chinese elements so we put our focus on those unique and typical such as the four great inventions chinese calligraphy chinese painted scroll taiji martial arts and others
2446555 the eu will play its full role in reviving the peace process in the region on the political and economic levels
2446556 we have discussed a broad range of challenges what the eu can do what the european parliament can do
2446557 it is my ambition as president of parliament to promote with all modest means of course the peace process in the middle east
2446558 i am personally and deeply convinced that a peace in the middle east to solve the palestine problem which is one of the core questions is really decisive for the relations between the european union and the muslim and arab world
2446559 ripped off the people despite the discourse of self rule
2446560 in order to save our honor we decided to sell our hotels
2446561 asked ytl 200 million from turkey but ankara did not give them any money
2446562 israel is disappointed that turkey has invited for an official visit a leader who denies publicly the holocaust and thus grants him legitimacy
2446563 the visit will give legitimacy to a leader calling daily for the destruction of another country
2446564 solving the iranian nuclear issue diplomatically is one thing but there is a difference between trying to solve it diplomatically and giving legitimacy to a leader of a country which calls for the destruction of another country i think it is a bad idea to invite him and to host him at a time when iran is not giving any signs of cooperating with the international community
2446565 our major concern is that the international community remain united in its message to iran that it must give up its nuclear ambition
2446566 we understand turkey is neighbors with iran we hope that it gives the right messages to iran
2446567 the draft law for protecting personal datas philosophy is to protect human rights
2446568 we will not have ad messages to our mobile phones or not to deal with junk e mails filling out our mailboxes
2446569 the draft law for protecting personal data prevents the individual from being transparent in front of the state
2446570 the law states the ways to protect personal data but immediately after that it brings exceptions
2446571 turkey is a democratic state governed by the rule of law the act of parliament regarding the rector appointments has been in effect for 12 years there were similar cases during the presidency of ahmet necdet sezer who appointed the rector candidates ranked third and even the fourth on the list however this never came up on the agenda
2446572 the election is a race that should be undertaken with equal conditions for all sides it was not quite so in our case akayd n employed 198 people as well as 113 administrators within four years which means there was a serious cluster supporting him and his administration meanwhile i have not employed a single person in my life
2446573 if a university has a school of medicine it is quite unlikely for the candidates from the faculty of social sciences to be appointed as rector akdeniz university was governed by the academics from the school of medicine for years
2446574 being a professor at the history department i have been elected the new rector in such an environment i also came forward as a candidate in 2004 getting a total of 90 votes
2446575 i have been working as a historian for 17 years i am also a member of the turkish armed forces atat rk research and education center i have been giving lectures on kemalism democracy secularism and modernity for years i will never make a concession in these principles whatsoever
2446576 they talk for instance this one tells me every autumn to stay around as it completely turns pink
2446577 when i was 19 my father called me for the family business but all my mind was at the mountains i was thinking about my retirement
2446578 this is a scientific center this is a gene center all these should live
2446579 the commissions statement isnt satisfactory to explain such a high number of deaths
2446580 the commission making a verbal statement instead of a written one is interesting the statement is far from explaining the reasons of the deaths and is solely aimed at relieving the effects of reactions
2446581 which institution is responsible for the infant deaths the health ministry or the hospital the ministry didnt take any responsibility on the matter
2446582 the hospital is responsible for the situation the bodies cant be transferred without a coffin this is absolutely prohibited the hospital has to have a coffin
2446583 all opposition to turkeys european union accession is built on lack of knowledge about turkey in my 20 years in turkey i have organized for more than 100 french businessmen to visit turkey they were all extremely surprised
2446584 i am a real frenchman but i have lived in foreign countries all my life
2446585 it was on june 21 1985 i never forget the date because it was the first time that i saw the bosporus i discovered istanbul i knew nothing about it it was a complete surprise
2446586 these were fascinating years because these were the years of the new developing turkey
2446587 we thought the traffic was horrible back then it is even more dangerous now
2446588 ive had and interesting life here i worked first for the french state then for a cement company and now as a consultant to foreign companies in turkey
2446589 i felt immediately at ease with turks especially with bakkal grocery store owner kap c superintendent of apartment building fishermen because their hearts are close to their minds they are very spontaneous and show hospitality
2446590 there is a tradition of hospitality among turks and foreigners are happy when that hospitality is extended to them also
2446591 the total turnover of trade between the countries is 9 billion euros this could be even better i am optimistic for the future
2446592 these show that the french market is open to turkish companies but it also shows that the potential has not been discovered
2446593 we need to face it today the average french citizens knowledge of modern turkey is low
2446594 the french media mentions turkey when there are honor crimes bombings or because of the headscarf issue
2446595 the armenian issue sarkozy these negative events actually had a positive side the more people hear turkeys name mentioned the more people become curious about turkey
2446596 the eurovision song contest held in istanbul a couple of years ago was fantastic public relations for turkey in between songs they would show images of turkey and millions were looking at these images
2446597 it is time for teenagers of both countries to come together
2446598 you go to a supermarket and tarkan is playing in the place this is the way interest grows among youth
2446599 in turkish culture there is no distinction between work life and private life strangely i have grown used to it
2446600 the delivery room was moved to a compound with insufficient sanitary conditions prone to infections
2446601 two or three women are made to wait on the same stretcher before giving birth and sometimes three newborn babies are put in the same incubator
2446602 there are 27 people still being treated at hospitals for their injuries there are none who are in critical condition but still we are closely following their state i can happily say that the matter is solved we have irrefutable evidence and have detained most of the suspects those who aided and abetted the bombers are also under arrest the terrorist group is responsible for the attack we see this as an important success for our police department
2446603 integration with the eu is state policy and a strategic decision but it cannot run at an idle speed the process should be hastened
2446604 we should take on the eu target with determination the reform process cannot be in tatters there is a need to focus turkey on the eu target and put it in a comprehensive reform process a reform campaign should be launched
2446605 when the size of military is taken into account it is interesting that ya didnt discuss any reports on anti secular activities i think that there is a warm relationship between the government and the general staff
2446606 professors who vote know candidates for 10 or 20 years
2446607 even if there is an interference with the university decision reasons must be adequately laid out
2446608 you go do an interview with someone and you think they are so full of s but youre cutting out large parts of your perception to do the job its whats underneath this hunger rage sex birth death that youre not getting in a profile
2446609 in journalism youre supposed to see through things but youre not supposed to say it
2446610 two people can get up with nothing in their minds and riff off of one another
2446611 these are the kinds of things ive looked for and couldnt find in new york and paris
2446612 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it mutt williams and the search for elvis
2446613 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2446614 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2446615 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2446616 i like when you focus on making movies you make movies and people go to see them
2446617 but theres this whole other industry thats been created which the world hasnt quite adjusted to or caught up to or figured out
2446618 all paths are the same if they end in god
2446619 all paths to god are my paths all those who follow the path towards god no matter they are muslims christians jews or buddhists are my brothers and sisters
2446620 we all are the followers of the same path the one that leads us to the eternal light
2446621 anatolia is a magical world peoples have similar characteristics in terms of emotions
2446622 in that inn i want to perform all melodies dedicated to god
2446623 if i fail to internalize the emotions in a lullaby ballad or any song i just do not share it with my cello which is my companion
2446624 we have no right to consume the culture of these lands so unconsciously
2446625 whenever i play that ancient lullaby which was told by a mother after her childs death i do cry
2446626 ill try to remove the seal on peoples hearts with sounds of rivers winds birds that is to say with the melodies of god in my next album
2446627 always i am an istanbullu in part i love istanbul for the city the beauty and memories istanbul is all together
2446628 i was happy in paris progressed in my work on colors and sculpting and had good friends
2446629 new york is top of the world the top of the himalayas
2446630 in the 1980s new york was very different than now but i loved the atmosphere if you have the energy you are welcome in this city
2446631 i had two big shows in brussels it was a fruitful time
2446632 i call it an accident in the sea two people try to hold each other in a storm the sea is the political and social arena with critical moments
2446633 i try to attack humoristically and i use black humor in my work
2446634 i want to show political and social problems in turkey
2446635 the body has always been a problem in turkish society in political and social terms take for instance the women problems and their delicate situations these were present during all my career
2446636 the body is untouchable i work around it and like to open it
2446637 i always try to put in something political whether this has to do with repression the military push or turkish people
2446638 animals give new possibilities of forms in the past i took my son to the zoo and i was looking more than my child did
2446639 subconsciously i put all the forms and shapes in my head i started to do that automatically and used it later in my work
2446640 the modern red car represents turkey it wants to be fast the driver is enormous he is overly present and there is no second place
2446641 the driver is reading a letter and at the same time somebody puts a geographic map of turkey on the front side of the car this is done by a second person who comes out of the front wheel of the car he wants to show the route to the driver but he is only paying attention to his own reading
2446642 in this painting there are so many hidden stories it can be the government the military push or the problems in the east of turkey related to pkk kurdistan workers party
2446643 normally i prefer painting but actually i am equal in that sense the possibility to do two arts at the same quality level of work is the same
2446644 there is no age for this there is no age for painting
2446645 i would like to work for one more period in france around paris not in paris i like calm living
2446646 historically greece hasnt offered good quality wines because the money wasnt around to make them
2446647 it wasnt until recently that the greek economy was ready to make the necessary investments she says
2446648 critics and sommeliers have strong reservations about greek wines says anne kokotos who founded domaine helios in 1976 with her husband george he is sailing the river styx on his boat as a break from overseeing production with the sallas banking family
2446649 and the greek wine industry doesnt have the promotion budget to fight back
2446650 i dont think grande reserve sells at too cheap a price
2446651 a wine doesnt need to be expensive to be prestigious
2446652 its not in the greek character to guard wine until maturity she says
2446653 we are too impatient we want to drink it now
2446654 it wasnt until the 1990s that greece started to make some wines that could be aged
2446655 theres already a winery in california named domaine helios so we need to rebrand before offering grand reserve in america
2446656 the tube tunnel will make istanbuls traffic better although private cars should not be used as a major transportation instrument
2446657 the tunnel may not solve the problem but should at least ease the congestion in central areas like mecidiyek y and taksim we need any investment in transportation we can get
2446658 we support public transportation and railway like the marmaray project private cars should not be encouraged anymore in istanbul
2446659 having the longest tunnel for the automobiles is not a good idea if traffic congestion happens in the tunnel people may be poisoned with the exhaust fumes furthermore the roads that go to the entrances of the tunnel are already too crowded those places cannot tolerate a greater attraction of traffic
2446660 the land where the tunnels entrances are planned to be built isnt cheap but the prices will certainly increase after the tunnel has opened
2446661 people living in those places are middle class in general and they may be replaced by high income owners after the tube tunnel is opened
2446662 the cleaning pipes cannot always filter all the particles in the exhaust and those places where the air in the tunnel is released will be dangerous for public health the same problem happened in countries like japan
2446663 the project is too risky financially the cost is high and we will be paying this with our taxes if the company cannot meet its costs in a certain year in the end not the company but the state will make a loss
2446664 the project is highly significant not only for istanbul but also for turkey
2446665 this second immersed tube under the bosporus will be a first in the world for it will be constructed at a greater depth than that of the marmaray tunnel
2446666 we are trying to make a choice among seven foreign funds at the moment this partnership which will be established by the end of 2008 will bring the company revenues of 1 5 billion we will be able to open hilton garden inn hotels in 81 cities of the country by means of this revenue
2446667 we have been expanding in turkey at a consistent and fast pace
2446668 the land prices were extremely high because we had to compete with companies that would construct residences and shopping centers however the prices decreased up to 300 percent in the aftermath of the stagnation in the sector
2446669 we have increased our objective of the construction of 20 hotels to the construction of 81 hotels we focus on all the cities in the country to which people travel for business
2446670 we are extremely concerned about constructing hotels boasting advantageous transportation facilities we will build hilton hotels that will encompass restaurants bars gyms and business centers with at least a 160 room capacity
2446671 yap kredi grew as it bought a mid size bank in the first half of the year
2446672 reaching ytl 64 6 billion worth asset size as of june the bank yielded a return on equity of 32 percent
2446673 we grew 83 percent in consumer credits in annual basis while the small and medium size enterprises smes loans increased 72 percent this figures show our growth rates exceed the sector average
2446674 while we performed well in the first half of the year the bank expenditures raised 13 percent and the balance sheet quality increased
2446675 the ratio between securities and assets has been 22 percent with a 4 percent decline in the same period and yap kredi is still the market leader in credit cards with 18 percent share
2446676 despite the slowdown in economy total living credit volume increased 19 percent on an annual basis and 43 percent compared to the first six months of last year and it reached ytl 34 1 billion
2446677 reaching ytl 39 5 billion our total deposit increased 23 percent compared to the same period of 2007
2446678 our aim is organic growth in turkey however we are always open to purchasing another bank if the opportunity emerges
2446679 we are not satisfied with our current market share of about 3 percent
2446680 in fact this is an assertive target however as ing we are assertive in order to grow in turkey we will provide all kinds of support particularly in finance to the team here
2446681 we saw the future opportunities in turkey we will see together how the potential will come to life as the reforms continue
2446682 our target is to take steps along the growth path and reach our targets should opportunities in acquiring new banks emerge we will also assess them
2446683 we approach the countries we enter with a long term perspective and aim to contribute to them
2446684 he said adding the situation was the same for russia
2446685 we are here in turkey looking for opportunities in turkeys development and growth we will also contribute to this development
2446686 we have changed oyakbanks name to ing but we still want to be a turkish bank
2446687 we did not consider bringing new technologies to turkish banking since the country already has every kind of technology there is also intense competition as ing bank we will still try to create a difference in this climate of competition
2446688 we do not feel panic in a fluctuating climate but guide our teams there is fluctuation in turkey however apparently there will be an uptrend in the economy in the long run we envisage a very good future in turkey
2446689 this is telling us that sales have stabilized this raises some hopes that weve flattened out which doesnt mean the problem is solved
2446690 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2446691 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
2446692 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2446693 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2446694 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaeda in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2446695 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2446696 indicate a continued weakening outlook for all the major seven economies
2446697 the latest data for non oecd member economies tentatively point to expansion in china and brazil and a downturn in india and russia
2446698 is designed to provide early signals of turning points peaks and troughs between upswings and downswings in the growth cycle of economic activity
2446699 growth figures for mid 2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year
2446700 while our economy faces substantial difficulties that will continue to be a drag on growth in the short term it is important to remember that our long term fundamentals are strong
2446701 challenges and difficulties are growing for maintaining fast and stable economic growth due to rising international uncertainties and problems in the domestic economy
2446702 as of last night that was one of the issues being discussed between the two sides there is no agreement yet but this is what the iraqis are asking for
2446703 we feel theres a serious intention by the american forces for a withdrawal timetable at the very least
2446704 it should not be considered an end to the mehdi army but its a halfway step to dissolving the mehdi army if the u s began to implement a withdrawal timetable we shall complete the path to dissolution
2446705 this will not mean ending the ceasefire it will depend on whats going on on the ground
2446706 the key challenge now is to place the economy on a sustainable high growth path which in our view requires reinvigoration of the reform agenda
2446707 some items of manufacturing particularly textiles continue with negative growth rates and the automotive industry doesnt look good either
2446708 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
2446709 oil is driving the foreign trade deficit up which is reflecting on the current account
2446710 a higher current account deficit means we need more financing from abroad
2446711 theres this giant elephant in the room hillary clinton that he still has to contend with
2446712 the party is fighting an uphill battle to unify itself and this would have happened no matter who was the nominee there are a lot of unhappy democrats still out there
2446713 i am going to continue to do whatever i can to help senator obama and democrats across the country win in the november elections
2446714 she is very enthusiastic about the need for a unified party
2446715 i think he should be taking this very seriously as the last thing the democrats want to do is project a divided image at the convention
2446716 in this era of fragmented media and targeted communications this is really the only time a presidential hopeful has a forum to speak to the nation as a whole
2446717 the rumors that they are close to a settlement are not unfounded
2446718 both citigroup and merrill lynch announced retail programs the one that ubs is rumored to announce will also cover institutional clients
2446719 today the iraqi oil ministry celebrates a return to work by iraqi oil exploration teams after 20 years of interruption
2446720 flight 406 had to return after the bomb threat no one was injured once the safety of the airplane is confirmed the plane will take off soon
2446721 the areas are underexplored but considered as highly prospective drilling areas
2446722 units of the 58th army have set off to help russian peacekeepers and they are now close to tskhinvali
2446723 calls on the parties to stop military action and negotiate directly with each other
2446724 a conflict environment that could threaten regional peace and security
2446725 turkey has both historical cultural and traditional relationship with caucasia so we expect neutral attitude from turkey governments toward the dispute between tbilisi and breakaway regions which will also prompts peace drive in the region until now turkey cannot achieve these goals but its still not late
2446726 turkey should benefit from its potential and historic relationship to develop fresh solutions for caucasia crisis but as we witnessed in the past turkey generally prefers non reacting approach toward the caucasian disagreement
2446727 leaders around the world condemned the strike and call for peaceful solutions but the united states and georgia last week launched a joint military exercise in the south caucasus state while russian troops were taking part in a drill in the nearby region tbilisi cannot attempt this adventure if it does not has backing from the international community
2446728 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2446729 we have russian tanks moving in we have continuous russian bombardment since yesterday specifically targeting the civilian population
2446730 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2446731 the georgian leadership has resorted to very aggressive actions he said
2446732 there are casualties including among russian peacekeepers this is very sad and this will incur a response
2446733 this morning our forces came into contact with the warriors we killed two more now the number of the dead has gone up from 10 on monday to 12 as i speak
2446734 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2446735 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2446736 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2446737 what ultimately happened in spite of the system was justice
2446738 they chose to make this a test case but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff
2446739 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2446740 asking for 30 years to life not only was ill advised and wholly inappropriate but was also soundly rejected by the panel
2446741 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2446742 i am fond of the turks it is my special intention as an exercise in mortification to learn the turkish language
2446743 a favorite thing in turkish grammar how lame can you get
2446744 he isnt here he probably went out but i didnt actually see him leave
2446745 i dont think it will be a significant ratcheting up of the sanctions
2446746 i dont think anyone really has the stomach for that
2446747 the more people wait the more enrichment the iranians do
2446748 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
2446749 iran has a strong hand the price of oil being what it is gives them a nice cushion
2446750 it will be really hard for awhile then one day it wont be
2446751 who has time to read those pages and worse whoever had the time to write them
2446752 it is not as if oxford was in anl urfa and i failed to be enrolled
2446753 i was so ashamed that she was wearing such a dress it was not tatl ses who asked me to shoot her i did it on my own i am sorry bo
2446754 i never asked anyone to kill anyone but bozan was threatening me from prison
2446755 surely the road to the european union will prohibit this
2446756 now every self respecting egyptian will admit there is a problem
2446757 come previsto il traffico molto intenso sulla a1 autostrada del sole da milano verso napoli e sulla a14 adriatica da bologna verso la riviera romagnola dice il comunicato il traffico si manterr molto intenso fino al tardo pomeriggio
2446758 study at school is more important than prayer at the mosque
2446759 a single pole university will give more tragic results than single pole politics
2446760 we are aiming to enhance freedoms and introduce standards for our youth
2446761 but the real united nations almost invisible to the general public is an action oriented u n this real u n feeds 90 million people in more than 70 countries a thin blue line between hungry people and starvation it wipes out debilitating diseases like smallpox and polio and vaccinates 40 percent of the worlds children
2446762 let us remember that talking sometimes achieves things too its the talk that put u n peacekeepers on the ground in 18 countries on four continents its the talk that raises the money and mandates the programs that feed so many of the worlds hungry its the talk that marks the worlds first steps towards dealing with climate change the global food crisis and a daily array of humanitarian crises
2446763 youve got a choice either you end your writing or your life will end
2446764 we will not allow anyone to talk or write against the democratic process of krg anyone who doesnt obey will have to take the consequences
2446765 we have both graduated and are going to be married this double excitement is only eased by the experiences we have gained at school
2446766 i will continue my life as us rather than me i vow to love you all my life
2446767 atasoy was an officer with no prospect of him for escape that is why no handcuffs were used during his transfer the fact that other police officers were hugging him should be evaluated as friendly support
2446768 the contractor that built our complex constructed the pier and the restaurant on it we turned this place into an area where youngsters do sports
2446769 i do not keep telling myself that i am 67 when i am riding
2446770 la situazione continua a deteriorare i civili continuano a morire
2446771 coloro i quali sono responsabili per questa catastrofe umanitaria dovrebbero sopportare le conseguenze per quello che hanno fatto
2446772 unit tattiche hanno completamente liberato tskhinvali dai militari georgiani e hanno cominciato a spingere le unit georgiane oltre la zona di responsabilit dei peacekeepers
2446773 its been proven scientifically that the thermal water has decreased in the region and if used wastefully there will be a scarcity of thermal water in this heaven on earth pamukkale
2446774 we will take the necessary precautions i believe that the meeting will help us solve the problem
2446775 the classical and uncontrolled methods of water usage threaten the water sources and were worried about the future of thermal water in the region well give great importance for the superstructure in pamukkale because infrastructure works have been going on since 1990 and they have been completed
2446776 weve decided to hold this meeting to discuss how to use natural resources more efficiently
2446777 our governor shows a lot of effort to make sensible decisions about the water problem in pamukkale its an advantage for us and well solve the problem working in collaboration well set a target to prevent a possible thermal water scarcity in pamukkale
2446778 i most of the time use a spatula when i paint
2446779 this is a known technique but i like establishing relations with patterns and installations
2446780 ala at was not a place that would come to mind to open an exhibition
2446781 i felt that they really gave importance and value to my works the k rm z ard ku u gallery tries to improve the cultural life in the neighborhood thats what made me say yes to display my works in ala at
2446782 the ones in ala at s k rm z ard ku u gallery are just part of the series that i am still working on
2446783 there was great interest and i was really surprised by the number of visitors coming to see my works
2446784 the ones who own my prior works can understand the wholeness easily
2446785 there is always time for everything if you can put your plans in right order and if you take advantage of your time you can do everything
2446786 in didim teda has been torturing the tradesmen for years yet this year the power cuts have been worse
2446787 who will cover my loss the season is not good anyway and these power cuts make business even worse there were eight cuts last night i witnessed that some of the british were getting scared after the fifth or sixth cut
2446788 ive never seen or heard anything like last night most of the documents in my computer are now gone teda is practically torturing us i will file a complaint
2446789 in this case it is a matter of the relationship between pictorial and cinematic representation as for example the film cuts from a painting of an urban landscape to a filmic image of the same landscape or makes a painted train come alive by cutting to a real train coming out of a station the truth is that they are both representations what differs is the mode or mechanism of representation
2446790 that begin to articulate his concept of cinematic language the use of sequence shots and tableaux vivants a theatrical mise en sc ne an economical use of camera movement an emphasis on spoken language a sustained exploration of the relationship between literature theater and the cinema a certain literalness of adaptation a specific mode of representation by his actors and a high degree of self reflexivity
2446791 represents the culmination of oliveiras exploration of the relationship between film and theater

2446795 a carbon tax will raise energy prices but lower and middle income people especially will find ways to reduce carbon emissions so as to come out ahead product demand will spur economic activity and innovation the rate of infrastructure replacement thus economic activity can be modulated by how fast the carbon tax rate increases the tax is progressive the poorest benefiting most with profligate energy users forced to pay for their excesses
2446796 denise says it is a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue
2446797 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohamed
2446798 i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder

2446808 due to lack of credibility of the threat the building lapd and mgm are not recommending that we take any actions
2446809 currently farmers have few options to reduce the contribution that livestock make to greenhouse gas production

2446853 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
2446854 women and girls especially young girls are the most unprotected people of afghanistan they are raped kidnapped and murdered
2446855 in order for a rape to be validated victims must have four male witnesses to the crime if not the victims can be charged with fornication or adultery
2446856 i have sought the advice of fifa vice president concacaf and cfu president and special advisor to the ttff mr
2446857 it is mr warner and the ttff who are responsible for assisting in my education and development both as a coach and a person
2446858 and it is they who have given me temporary leave to work with the gff and guyana football
2446859 on the advice of mr warner and based on my own personal assessment of this matter i will not be drawn into taking any side nor become part of the continuation of what has now become a dispute
2446860 instead i offer myself to part of the solution and would advise that cfu concacaf and ultimately the fifa has an avenue to deal with our problems disputes and conflicts that will come up in our football though we have constitutions
2446861 my first advice is for a forum to be made available for the stakeholders in guyanas football to sit down face to face with someone appointed by the cfu to talk to listen to each other and then look to solutions
2446862 i am bombarded every day by members of the public in guyana to state my position and i hear hurt pain good things and bad things
2446863 conveniently activists like to say that the voice of the people is the voice of god but i disagree the voice of the people can also at times be the voice of ignorance
2446864 and it is because of this i suggest that the gff establish such a forum similar to the fifa comunity conference and get cfu to send an independent arbitrator and lets talk before this matter reaches to constitutional stage of conflict

2446875 particularly troubling from a regulator perspective was the fact that the guyana geology amp mines commission ggmc sent in someone to investigate some of the claims that had been made by persons living in the area at the same time that the sn reporter visited but the ensuing report was unresponsive to the main concerns the report for the ggmc failed to adequately address the damage that had been done and the urgency of swift action

2446877 if we want to transform our country and increase our level of prosperity we need to be working and producing and growing and developing at rates of 10 to 20 percent per year we need to change some of our attitudes in getting things done there is need for us to adopt methods that would popularize aquaculture
2446878 i think the future is bright for aquaculture the commissioning of the facility will certainly allow guyana in the near future to become a significant player in the global aquaculture business

2446890 d por sentado que acatar la decisi n del tribunal constitucional
2446891 dentro de la legalidad se est n cerrando todas las puertas
2446892 la respuesta que se est dando por parte de zapatero a la cuesti n de la consulta es desproporcionada unilateral y dif cilmente entendible
2446893 rodr guez zapatero ha tomado la decisi n unilateral y personal de suspender la consulta porque aqu su voluntad es imponer que los vascos no podamos hacer nada que desde madrid no quieren que hagamos ya nos han dicho en m s de una ocasi n que no tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro futuro y ahora nos est n diciendo que no tenemos derecho ni siquiera a opinar
2446894 es lo que estamos defendiendo en las reuniones que estamos manteniendo con el resto de formaciones pol ticas queremos convencerles de que la consulta se tiene que hacer y desgraciadamente a d a de hoy el pnv ya dej sentado que ellos van a acatar la decisi n del tc que es lo mismo que decir que no van a empujar para que la consulta se haga
2446895 paso importante en torno a la cuesti n de la materializaci n del derecho a decidir
2446896 si nos cierran esta v a inventaremos nuevas v as
2446897 es quiz esa falta de unidad o de uniformidad en las opciones de otras formaciones pol ticas las que impiden que proyectos importantes como el de ley de consulta no hayan sido socializados
2446898 es sacar el derecho a decidir del centro del debate pol tico y por eso es tan importante para zapatero que el pr ximo ejecutivo vasco no sea nacionalista
2446899 un candidato teledirigido desde madrid no va a defender los intereses de los vascos
2446900 se va a dedicar m s a las genuflexiones ante zapatero y el gobierno espa ol que a empujar por las necesidades de los vascos
2446901 desde madrid se rechazan sistem ticamente las iniciativas que se aprueban con el respaldo mayoritario del parlamento vasco
2446902 los vascos no se pueden permitir un lehendakari que no cree en el derecho a decidir
2446903 tendr a que haber un art culo en el estatuto o en la constituci n que excluyera expresamente esa posibilidad
2446904 una reflexi n en profundidad entre los partidos las formaciones pol ticas sindicales asociaciones etc porque se nos est cerrando el futuro y tenemos un cors que nos aprieta demasiado
2446905 ese pueblo siempre ha acatado y actuado sometido a la legalidad pero tambi n tenemos que ser conscientes de que dentro de esa legalidad se nos han ido cerrando todas las puertas no tenemos margen de evoluci n de desarrollo como pueblo y va siendo hora de abrir un debate estrat gico entre las formaciones pol ticas para dar pasos en otro sentido de superaci n del actual marco jur dico y creo sinceramente que tenemos que colaborar las formaciones pol ticas que somos independentistas

2446963 two years ago our consultants predicted that west eggs landfill which is used for garbage disposal would be completely filled within five years during the past two years however town residents have been recycling twice as much aluminum and paper as they did in previous years next month the amount of material recycled should further increase since charges for garbage pickup will double furthermore over ninety percent of the respondents to a recent survey said that they would do more recycling in the future because of our residents strong commitment to recycling the available space in our landfill should last for considerably longer than predicted
2446964 during the past year alta manufacturing had thirty percent more on the job accidents than nearby panoply industries where the work shifts are one hour shorter than ours experts believe that a significant contributing factor in many on the job accidents is fatigue and sleep deprivation among workers therefore to reduce the number of on the job accidents at alta and thereby increase productivity we should shorten each of our three work shifts by one hour so that our employees will get adequate amounts of sleep
2446965 we have recently been offered the opportunity to buy the rights to produce a video game based on the soon to be published childrens book
2446966 there is evidence that consumers are becoming more and more interested in growing their own vegetables a national survey conducted last month indicated that many consumers were dissatisfied with the quality of fresh vegetables available in supermarkets and locally the gardening magazine great gardens has sold out at the village news stand three months in a row thus we at green thumb gardening center can increase our profits by greatly expanding the variety of vegetable seeds we stock for gardeners this coming spring
2446967 over 80 percent of the respondents to a recent survey indicated a desire to reduce their intake of foods containing fats and cholesterol and today low fat products abound in many food stores since many of the food products currently marketed by old dairy industries are high in fat and cholesterol the companys sales are likely to diminish greatly and their profits will no doubt decrease we therefore advise old dairy stockholders to sell their shares and other investors not to purchase stock in this company
2446968 two years ago our neighboring state lucria began a state lottery to supplement tax revenues for education and public health today lucria spends more per pupil than we do and lucrias public health program treats far more people than our states program does if we were to establish a state lottery like the one in lucria the profits could be used to improve our educational system and public health program the new lottery would doubtless be successful because a survey conducted in our capital city concludes that citizens of impecunia already spend an average of 50 per person per year on gambling
2446969 walnut groves town council has advocated switching from ez disposal which has had the contract for trash collection services in walnut grove for the past ten years to abc waste because ez recently raised its monthly fee from 2 000 to 2 500 a month whereas abcs fee is still 2 000 but the town council is mistaken we should continue using ez ez collects trash twice a week while abc collects only once moreover ez which like abc currently has a fleet of 20 trucks has ordered additional trucks finally ez provides exceptional service 80 percent of respondents to last years town survey agreed that they were satisfied with ezs performance
2446970 in an attempt to improve highway safety prunty county recently lowered its speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 45 on all major county roads but the 55 mph limit should be restored because this safety effort has failed most drivers are exceeding the new speed limit and the accident rate throughout prunty county has decreased only slightly if we want to improve the safety of our roads we should instead undertake the same kind of road improvement project that butler county completed five years ago increasing lane widths and resurfacing rough roads today major butler county roads still have a 55 mph speed limit yet there were 25 percent fewer reported accidents in butler county this past year than there were five years ago
2446971 one year ago tickets for double rices concerts in stadiums around the country took on average at least 24 hours to sell out if they sold out at all but the band has been enjoying a surge in nationwide popularity among 14 to 25 year olds and the 30 000 tickets for a recent concert in megalopolis sold out in 12 minutes clearly the ticket sales in megalopolis are a result both of the bands increased popularity and of the advertising campaign run in megalopolis by the ad lib advertising agency thus in order to ensure that the bands success in megalopolis is repeated across the country the band should hire ad lib to duplicate the megalopolis ad campaign on a nationwide scale
2446972 the population of balmer island increases to 100 000 duing the summer months to reduce the number of accidents involving mopeds and pedestrians the town council of balmer island should limit the number of mopeds rented by each of the islands six moped and bicycle rental companies from 50 per day to 30 per day during the summer season by limiting the number of rentals the town council is sure to attain the 50 percent reduction in moped accidents that was achieved last year in the neighboring island of torseau when torseaus town council enforced similar limits on moped rentals
2446973 five years ago at a time when we had difficulties in obtaining reliable supplies of high quality wool fabric we discontinued production of our deluxe alpaca overcoats now that we have a new fabric supplier we should resume production this coat should sell very well since we have not offered an alpaca overcoat for five years and since our major competitor no longer makes an alpaca overcoat there will be pent up customer demand also since the price of most types of clothing has risen in each of the past five years customers should be willing to pay significantly higher prices for alpaca overcoats than they did five years ago and our company profits will increase
2446974 over the past five years the population of steel city has increased by more than 20 percent and family incomes in steel city have risen much faster than the national average nationwide sales of houses priced above 150 000 have increased more than have sales of lower priced houses such data indicate that we should make changes in our business to increase company profits first we should build fewer low priced houses than we did last year and focus instead on building houses designed to sell at above 150 000 second we should hire additional workers so that we can build a larger total number of houses than we did last year
2446975 in order to reduce costs we should close some of our existing small assembly plants and build a large central plant grandview would be an ideal location for this new plant first of the locations that we have considered grandview has the largest adult population so that we will be able to staff our plant quickly and easily second since the average wage earned by workers in grandview is less than that in the other locations we should be able to keep production costs low last as an inducement for us to build there grandviews town council has offered to allow us to operate for the first three years without paying city taxes
2446976 two years ago the town of ocean view built a new municipal golf course and resort hotel during the past two years tourism in ocean view has increased new businesses have opened there and ocean views tax revenues have risen by 30 percent the best way to improve hopewells economy and generate additional tax revenues is to build a golf course and resort hotel similar to those in ocean view
2446977 for the past five years mr charles schade has been the music director at steel city high school and during that time the school band from steel city high has won three regional band competitions in addition the quality of the music rehearsal facilities and musical instruments at steel city high has improved markedly over the past five years because of such successes at steel city high the saluda school board should hire mr schade to plan and direct the general music education programs for the entire saluda school system
2446978 it has come to my attention that sparks inc the manufacturing company that just moved into our state is advertising job openings at salaries that are twice as high as those paid to our experienced assembly line workers some of our employees have already left to work for sparks in order to keep our best staff we must pay them salaries equal to those sparks pays its employees otherwise we will continue to lose employees in the future because sparks must staff the additional new plants that it plans to build in the state
2446979 a recent six month study in which breakfast was made available at school for 100 schoolchildren ages five to twelve found that children on the breakfast plan were less likely than other children to be absent from or late for school clearly eating breakfast before school plays a role in reducing student absenteeism and tardiness it is also well known that children who regularly eat a healthful breakfast tend to perform better in school therefore in order to reduce absenteeism and tardiness and to improve academic performance in all of mylars elementary and secondary schools we should provide breakfasts for all students before each school day
2446980 some states are creating new laws that restrict the use of of handheld cell phones by drivers of automobiles such legislation however is sheer folly although some people with cell phones undoubtedly cause problems on the road including serious accidents the majority do not besides problems are also caused by drivers who are distracted by any number of other activities from listening to the radio to disciplining children since there is no need to pass legislation restricting these and other such activities it follows that there is no need to restrict peoples freedom to use a device that they find convenient or helpful in emergencies
2446981 the discovery of distinctively shaped ceramic pots at various prehistoric sites scattered over a wide area has led archaeologists to ask how the pots were spread some believe the pot makers migrated to the various sites and carried the pots along with them others believe the pots were spread by trade and their makers remained in one place now analysis of the bones of prehistoric human skeletons can settle the debate high levels of a certain metallic element contained in various foods are strongly associated with people who migrated to a new place after childhood many of the bones found near the pots at a few sites showed high levels of the metallic element therefore it must be that the pots were spread by migration not trade
2446982 salicylates are members of the same chemical family as aspirin a medicine used to treat headaches although many foods are naturally rich in salicylates for the past several decades food processing companies have also been adding salicylates to foods as preservatives this rise in the commercial use of salicylates has been found to correlate with a steady decline in the average number of headaches reported by participants in our twenty year study recently food processing companies have found that salicylates can also be used as flavor additives for foods with this new use for salicylates we can expect a continued steady decline in the number of headaches suffered by the average citizen of mentia
2446983 twenty years ago dr field a noted anthropologist visited the island of tertia and concluded from his observations that children in tertia were reared by an entire village rather than by their own biological parents however my recent interviews with children living in the group of islands that includes tertia show that these children spend much more time talking about their biological parents than about other adults in the village this research proves that dr fields conclusion about tertian village culture is false and thus that the observation centered approach to studying cultures is invalid because they are using the interview centered method my team of graduate students working in tertia will establish a much more accurate understanding of child rearing traditions there and in other island cultures
2446984 an innovative treatment has come to our attention that promises to significantly reduce absenteeism in our schools and workplaces a study reports that in nearby east meria where fish consumption is very high people visit the doctor only once or twice per year for the treatment of colds clearly eating a substantial amount of fish can prevent colds since colds are the reason most frequently given for absences from school and work we recommend the daily use of ichthaid a nutritional supplement derived from fish oil as a good way to prevent colds and lower absenteeism
2446985 last year the number of students who enrolled in long distance degree programs at omni university increased by 50 during the same year omni showed a significant decrease from prior years in expenditures for dormitory and classroom space most likely because instruction in the long distance programs takes place via interactive video computer connections in contrast over the past three years enrollment at humana college has diminished and costs of maintaining buildings have risen thus to increase enrollment and solve the problem of budget deficits at humana college we should initiate and actively promote long distance degree programs like those at omni
2446986 the marine sanctuary on tria island was established to protect certain marine mammals its regulations ban dumping and offshore oil drilling within 20 miles of tria but fishing is not banned currently many fish populations in trias waters are declining a situation blamed on pollution in contrast the marine sanctuary on omni island has regulations that ban dumping offshore oil drilling and fishing within 10 miles of omni and omni reports no significant decline in its fish populations clearly the decline in fish populations in trias waters is the result of overfishing not pollution therefore the best way to restore trias fish populations and to protect all of trias marine wildlife is to abandon our regulations and adopt those of omni
2446987 workers should be allowed to reduce their workload from 40 to 25 or even 20 hours per week because it is clear that people who work part time instead of full time have better health and improved morale one store in workville which began allowing its employees to work part time last year reports that fewer days of sick leave were taken last year than in previous years in contrast the factory in workville which does not allow any of its employees to work part time had a slight increase in the number of days of sick leave taken last year in addition a recent survey reports that most of the store employees stated that they are satisfied with their jobs while many of the factory employees stated that they are dissatisfied with their jobs
2446988 academia high school should abolish its after school performing arts programs and replace them with computer technology programs when nearby techno high school did so last year total enrollment in all of its after school activities remained about the same moreover on entering college many techno students chose a major directly related to their after school activities on the other hand last year only 10 percent of academias graduating seniors chose performing arts as their major field of study in their first year of college clearly indicating that most students do not have a strong interest in the performing arts
2446989 new writers usually cannot convince large prestigious publishers that their work is marketable so they must first publish with smaller less well known presses to establish a sales record but the editors of mystery writers magazine have good news for aspiring writers the number of mystery novels published in the last two years has grown significantly and more people read mysteries than any other type of novel in addition almost half of the mystery novels published last year were written by first time novel writers since there is apparently an expanding market for mystery novels all publishers will want to increase the number of mystery novels they publish therefore new writers should write mystery novels to increase their chances for first time publication with a larger prestigious company
2446990 over the past year our late night news program has devoted increasingly more time to covering national news and less time to covering weather and local news during the same time period most of the complaints we received from viewers were concerned with the stations coverage of weather and local news in addition several local businesses that used to run advertisements during our late night news program have just cancelled their advertising contracts with us therefore in order to attract more viewers to our news programs and to avoid losing any further advertising revenues we should expand the coverage of weather and local news on all our news programs
2446991 as part of our new educational reform program we identified ten schools most in need of immediate improvement an advisory committee is now recommending that we hire consultants to study further the schools problems and to propose a plan of action only two years ago however another group of consultants determined that several schools in our district had problems because their principals were inexperienced thus if we want to see immediate improvement in our schools and save the district the money it would spend on hiring more consultants we should replace all the principals in the ten worst schools with ten of our most experienced principals in the district
2446992 at present mason city residents seldom use the nearby mason river for any kind of recreational activity even though surveys of the regions residents consistently rank water sports swimming fishing and boating as a favorite form of recreation since there have been complaints about the quality of the water in the river residents must be avoiding the river because they think that it is not clean enough but that situation is about to change the agency responsible for rivers in our region has announced plans to clean up mason river therefore recreational use of the river is likely to increase so the mason city council will need to increase its budget for improvements to the publicly owned lands along the mason river
2446993 we should abandon our current five year plan to purchase additional buses to serve the campus of southside university because students there are unlikely to use them consider the results of the recent campaign sponsored by the environmental club at southside university in a program on the campus radio station the club asked students to call in and pledge that they would commute to school by bus instead of by automobile at least one day per week only ten percent of the students called in and pledged in view of the campaigns lack of success we can assume that the bus service we currently offer will continue to be sufficient to serve the university
2446994 one study at lee university found that first semester grades of teenage students who had always attended public tax supported schools were slightly lower than the grades of students who had received some home schooling instruction by parents at home although the grade differences disappeared in the second semester these results suggest that home schooling is the best way to educate teenage children therefore instead of spending more money on public education the government should provide financial incentives so that home schooling is an option for more parents after all children schooled at home receive more attention since they are taught by the best possible teacher a parent who has a high stake in educating them well
2446995 during her seventeen years as a professor of botany professor thomas has proved herself to be well worth her annual salary of 50 000 her classes are among the largest at the university demonstrating her popularity among students moreover the money she has brought to the university in research grants has exceeded her salary in each of the last two years therefore in consideration of professor thomas demonstrated teaching and research abilities we recommend that she receive a 10 000 raise and a promotion to department chairperson without such a raise and promotion we fear that professor thomas will leave elm city university for another college
2446996 over the past year the consolidated copper company ccc has purchased over one million square miles of land in the tropical nation of west fredonia mining copper on this land will inevitably result in pollution and environmental disaster since west fredonia is home to several endangered animal species but such disaster can be prevented if consumers simply refuse to purchase products that are made with cccs copper until the company abandons its mining plans
2446997 your recent article on corporate downsizing in the united states is misleading the article gives the mistaken impression that many competent workers who lost jobs as a result of downsizing face serious economic hardship often for years before finding other suitable employment but this impression is contradicted by a recent report on the united states economy which found that since 1992 far more jobs have been created than have been eliminated the report also demonstrates that many of those who lost their jobs have found new employment two thirds of the newly created jobs have been in industries that tend to pay above average wages and the vast majority of these jobs are full time
2446998 the librarians in our towns school system have reported that the number of trips that our students make to their school library on a voluntary basis has decreased significantly in recent years for example the average seventh grade student visited the school library five times last year but four of those visits were part of required classroom activities this shows that our students are reading less than in the past to address this problem our town needs to improve the atmosphere of the libraries so that they will be comfortable places in which to work if students view the libraries as uncomfortable then they are unlikely to want to spend much time there
2446999 although the sales of whirlwind video games have declined over the past two years a recent survey of video game players suggests that this sales trend is about to be reversed the survey asked video game players what features they thought were most important in a video game according to the survey players prefer games that provide lifelike graphics which require the most up to date computers whirlwind has just introduced several such games with an extensive advertising campaign directed at people 10 to 25 years old the age group most likely to play video games it follows then that the sales of whirlwind video games are likely to increase dramatically in the next few months
2447000 mayor brown was recently re elected by a clear majority of 52 percent of monroetowns voters her re election however does not show that most people in our town favored mayor browns proposal for tax reduction over that of her opponent mr greene who proposed raising taxes to improve education it has been shown that voters nationwide tend to re elect people already in office regardless of candidates proposals in fact a local survey after the election showed most people in monroetown disagreed with mayor browns proposal clearly most people in monroetown favor improving education and therefore approve of mr greenes proposal despite the fact that they did not vote for him
2447001 since our mechanics are responsible for inspecting and maintaining our aircraft get away airlines should pay to send them to the quality care seminar a two week seminar on proper maintenance procedures i recommend this seminar because it is likely to be a wise investment given that the automobile racing industry recently reported that the performance of its maintenance crews improved markedly after their crews had attended the seminar these maintenance crews perform many of the same functions as do our mechanics including refueling and repairing engines the money we spend on sending our staff to the seminar will inevitably lead to improved maintenance and thus to greater customer satisfaction along with greater profits for our airline
2447002 the decline in the numbers of amphibians worldwide clearly indicates the global pollution of water and air two studies of amphibians in yosemite national park in california confirm my conclusion in 1915 there were seven species of amphibians in the park and there were abundant numbers of each species however in 1992 there were only four species of amphibians observed in the park and the numbers of each species were drastically reduced the decline in yosemite has been blamed on the introduction of trout into the parks waters which began in 1920 trout are known to eat amphibian eggs but the introduction of trout cannot be the real reason for the yosemite decline because it does not explain the worldwide decline
2447003 former mayor durant owes an apology to the city of atticus both the damage to the river bridge which connects atticus to hartley and the traffic problems we have long experienced on the bridge were actually caused 20 years ago by durant after all he is the one who approved the construction of the bridge if he had approved a wider and better designed bridge on which approximately the same amount of public money would have been spent none of the damage or problems would have occurred instead the river bridge has deteriorated far more rapidly over the past 20 years than has the much longer derby bridge up the river even though the winters have been severe in the past several years this is no excuse for the negligence and wastefulness of durant
2447004 erosion of beach sand along the shores of tria island is a serious threat to our island and our tourist industry in order to stop the erosion we should charge people for using the beaches although this solution may annoy a few tourists in the short term it will reduce the number of people using the beaches and will raise money for replenishing the sand replenishing the sand as was done to protect buildings on the nearby island of batia will help protect buildings along our shores thereby reducing these buildings risk of additional damage from severe storms and since the areas along the shore will be more attractive as a result the beaches will be preserved and the areas tourist industry will improve over the long term
2447005 ever since the 1950s when television sets began to appear in the average home the rate of crimes committed by teenagers in the country of alta has steadily increased this increase in teenage crime parallels the increase in violence shown on television according to several national studies even very young children who watch a great number of television shows featuring violent scenes display more violent behavior within their home environment than do children who do not watch violent shows furthermore in a survey conducted by the observer over 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime time television programs that are shown between 7 p m and 9 p m should show less violence therefore in order to lower the rate of teenage crime in alta television viewers should demand that television programmers reduce the amount of violence shown during prime time
2447006 in a study of the effects of exercise on longevity medical researchers tracked 500 middle aged men over a 20 year period the subjects represented a variety of occupations in several different parts of the country and responded to an annual survey in which they were asked how often and how strenuously do you exercise of those who responded the men who reported that they engaged in vigorous outdoor exercise nearly every day lived longer than the men who reported that they exercised mildly only once or twice a week given the clear link that this study establishes between longevity and exercise doctors should not recommend moderate exercise to their patients but should instead encourage vigorous outdoor exercise on a daily basis
2447007 too much emphasis is placed on the development of reading skills in elementary school many students who are discouraged by the lonely activity of reading turn away from schoolwork merely because they are poor readers but books recorded on audiocassette tape provide an important alternative for students at this crucial stage in their education one the school board should not reject merely because of the expense involved after all many studies attest to the value of allowing students to hear books read aloud there is even evidence that students whose parents read to them are even more likely to become able readers thus hearing books on tape can only make students more eager to read and to learn therefore the school board should encourage schools to buy books on tape and to use them in elementary education
2447008 we distributed a survey to senior management at international mega publishing inc the result of the survey clearly indicates that many employees were well prepared in business knowledge and computer skills but lacked interpersonal skills to interact gracefully with customers international mega publishing decided to improve customer satisfaction by sending their newly hired employees to our one day seminars since taking advantage of our program international mega publishing has seen a sharp increase in sales an indication that the number of their disgruntled customers has declined significantly your company should hire dickens and let us turn every employee into an ambassador for your company
2447009 as a local merchant i wish to support the development of a ski resort in the state park north of our township along with many other merchants who favor the proposal by ski the slopes incorporated i would of course experience a growth in my business but i also know how much more prosperous not to mention lively and interesting our community would be if tourism increased since the main opposition comes from a few environmentalists who do not even live in this community i see no reason to give in to their views the first national bank has finally researched the project and agreed to fund it as a result i see no reason to delay development of the resort
2447010 several factors indicate that radio station know should shift its programming from rock and roll music to a continuous news format consider for example the number of older people in our listening area has increased dramatically while the total number of our listeners has recently declined also music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music finally continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful and a survey taken just before the recent election shows that local citizens are interested in becoming better informed about politics
2447011 recently we signed a contract with the fly away pest control company to provide pest control services at our fast food warehouse in palm city but last month we discovered that over 20 000 worth of food there had been destroyed by pest damage meanwhile the buzzoff pest control company which we have used for many years continued to service our warehouse in wintervale and last month only 10 000 worth of the food stored there had been destroyed by pest damage even though the price charged by fly away is considerably lower our best means of saving money is to return to buzzoff company for all our pest control services
2447012 in order to strengthen its lagging economy last year the government of the nearby country of bellegea began an advertising campaign to promote ecologically sound tourism ecotourism this year the number of foreign visitors arriving at bellegeas main airport doubled and per capita income in bellegea increased by ten percent to provide more income for the population of paraterra and also preserve the natural environment of our tiny country we too should begin to promote ecotourism to ensure that our advertising campaign is successful we should hire the current director of bellegeas national tourism office as a consultant for the campaign
2447013 despite its downtown location the rialto movie theater a local institution for five decades must make big changes or close its doors forever it should follow the example of the new apex theater in the mall outside of town when the apex opened last year it featured a video arcade plush carpeting and seats and a state of the art sound system furthermore in a recent survey over 85 percent of respondents reported that the high price of newly released movies prevents them from going to the movies more than five times per year thus if the rialto intends to hold on to its share of a decreasing pool of moviegoers it must offer the same features as apex
2447014 monarch books should open a caf in its store to attract more customers and better compete with regal books which recently opened a caf monarch which has been in business at the same location for more than twenty years has a large customer following because it is known for its wide selection of books on all subjects opening the caf would clearly attract more customers the caf would require relatively little space space could be made for the caf by discontinuing the childrens book section which will likely become less popular given that the last national census indicated a significant decline in the percent of the population who are under age ten
2447015 arctic deer live on islands in canadas arctic region they search for food by moving over ice from island to island during the course of a year their habitat is limited to areas warm enough to sustain the plants on which they feed and cold enough at least some of the year for the ice to cover the sea separating the islands allowing the deer to travel over it unfortunately according to reports from local hunters the deer populations are declining since these reports coincide with recent global warming trends that have caused the sea ice to melt we can conclude that the decline in arctic deer populations is the result of deer being unable to follow their age old migration patterns across the frozen sea
2447016 twenty years ago one half of all citizens in corpora met the standards for adequate physical fitness as then defined by the national advisory board on physical fitness today the board says that only one quarter of all citizens are adequately fit and suggests that spending too much time using computers may be the reason but since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit instead as shown by this years unusually low expenditures on fitness related products and services the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause and fitness levels will improve when the economy does
2447017 for the past decade most health experts have advised teenagers to avoid eating greasy foods in order to prevent acne and related skin conditions but the number of teenagers who sought medical help for these skin problems has actually risen over the same period in a recent study teenagers who avoided greasy foods for a month reported approximately as many outbreaks of acne and related skin conditions as did those who ate an average of two servings of greasy food per day such data indicate that eating greasy foods is unlikely to be a cause of acne and related skin conditions therefore health experts should no longer recommend that people avoid such foods
2447018 as earth was being formed out of the collision of space rocks the heat from those collisions and from the increasing gravitational energy of the planet made the entire planet molten even the surface any water present would have evaporated and gone off into space as the planet approached its current size however its gravitation became strong enough to hold gases and water vapor around it as an atmosphere because comets are largely ice made up of frozen water and gases a comet striking earth then would have vaporized the resulting water vapor would have been retained in the atmosphere eventually falling as rain on the cooled and solidified surface of earth therefore the water in earths oceans must have originated from comets
2447019 doctors have long suspected that secondary infections may keep some patients from healing quickly after severe muscle strain this hypothesis has now been proved by preliminary results of a study of two groups of patients the first group of patients all being treated for muscle injuries by dr newland a doctor who specializes in sports medicine took antibiotics regularly throughout their treatment their recuperation time was on average 40 percent quicker than typically expected patients in the second group all being treated by dr alton a general physician were given sugar pills although the patients believed they were taking antibiotics their average recuperation time was not significantly reduced therefore all patients who are diagnosed with muscle strain would be well advised to take antibiotics as part of their treatment
2447020 several well known retired architects were interviewed in architecture today about changes in the field only one had earned a college degree in architecture all others had come into the field at an early age by serving apprenticeships that required them to work under the direct supervision of an experienced architect several of the colleges that we recruit from report that many promising architecture students leave school early in their undergraduate career therefore because finding talented architecture graduates is becoming more difficult baobob inc should start an aggressive apprenticeship program and hire students who express an interest in architecture directly out of high school rather than wait for them to get out of college
2447021 a recent research study reported the experience of dentists whose patients had over a period of five years regularly used flux dental floss as part of their dental hygiene routine the report indicates that these dentists had 50 percent fewer cases of gum disease than did dentists whose patients did not use flux regularly in addition most of the flux users who were surveyed by their dentists agreed that fluxs mint flavor would encourage people to floss more often thus even though flux may cost more than other brands of floss it is clearly a worthwhile investment for those who want to be assured of healthy teeth and gums
2447022 commuters are complaining that the rush hour traffic on blue highway between shady village and bright city has doubled their commuting time some commuters have asked that an additional traffic lane be built but the recent creation of such a lane on nearby green highway apparently attracted more commuters judging from the fact that rush hour traffic jams actually increased there this past winter to reduce rush hour traffic on blue highway a bicycle lane should be added instead of a traffic lane this approach will succeed because many citizens of shady village are avid bicyclists 75 percent of respondents to a recent questionnaire distributed there said they would like to bicycle more hours per week than they currently do
2447023 although the multimineral zorba pill was designed as a simple dietary supplement a study of first time ulcer patients who took zorba suggests that zorba actually helps prevent ulcers the study showed that only 25 percent of those ulcer patients who took zorba under a doctors direction developed new ulcers compared to a 75 percent recurrence rate among ulcer patients who did not take zorba clearly then zorba will be highly effective in preventing recurrent ulcers and if health experts inform the general public of this fact many first time ulcers can be prevented as well
2447024 in 1888 a stone was unearthed in northern wisconsin with an inscription in an old scandinavian alphabet and bearing the date 1362 scandinavians were not however exploring or emigrating to northern wisconsin in the fourteenth century recent analysis proves in fact that the stone had been buried in the spot where it was found for no more than 100 years moreover the community near the discovery site was home to a group of people who had formed a club to study medieval scandinavian culture a period that includes the fourteenth century the stone therefore is not a genuine artifact of medieval scandinavian culture inscribed in the fourteenth century but most likely a hoax perpetrated by the group
2447025 according to the available medical records the six worst worldwide flu epidemics during the past 300 years occurred in 1729 1830 1918 1957 1968 and 1977 these were all years with heavy sunspot activity that is years when the earth received significantly more solar energy than in normal years people at particular risk for the flu should therefore avoid prolonged exposure to the sun
2447026 several national medical studies suggest that older people who have pets tend to enjoy better health than those who do not have pets those who have pets have lower rates of high blood pressure and arthritis it seems clear that having to care for an animal promotes good health for the older person therefore glenntown should establish a program to give a small pet such as a dog or cat to all of its citizens who are over the age of 65 this will help to insure that our senior citizens enjoy good health and have fewer medical bills
2447027 nationally the average ratio of computers to students in kindergarten through grade 12 k 12 is 1 5 educators indicate that this is very good ratio this means that across the country all students have access to and can use computers daily in their classrooms in eylerias k 12 schools the ratio of computers to students is 1 7 this number is sufficient to ensure that all of eylerias students by the time they graduate from high school will be fully proficient in the use of computer technology thus there is no reason to spend any of the schools budget on computers or other technology in the next few years
2447028 only seven of our states high schools offer even one course in latin but over 80 percent of the graduates who study latin at those seven schools enroll in college furthermore a recent study shows that students who have mastered latin perform much better in logic and critical thinking thus in order to increase the percentage of our high school students who graduate from college as well as to ensure that they receive a better education in critical thinking omni state university should begin an intensive program to prepare our future teachers to teach high school latin
2447029 for many years all the stores in our chain have stocked a wide variety of both domestic and imported cheeses last year however the five best selling cheeses at our newest store were all domestic cheddar cheeses from wisconsin furthermore a recent survey by cheeses of the world magazine indicates an increasing preference for domestic cheeses among its subscribers since our company can reduce expenses by limiting inventory the best way to improve profits in all of our stores is to discontinue stocking many of our varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses
2447030 homes in the northeastern united states where winters are typically cold have traditionally used oil as their major fuel for heating last year that region experienced 90 days with below average temperatures and climate forecasters at waymarsh university predict that this weather pattern will continue for several more years furthermore many new homes have been built in this region during the past year because of these developments we predict an increased demand for heating oil and recommend investment in consolidated industries one of whose major business operations is the retail sale of home heating oil
2447031 both the villages of castorville and polluxton have experienced sharp declines in the numbers of residents who pay property taxes to save money and improve service the two villages recently merged their once separate garbage collection departments into a single department located in castorville and the new department has reported few complaints about its service last year the library in polluxton had 20 percent fewer users than during the previous year it follows that we should now further economize and improve service as we did with garbage collection by closing the library in polluxton and using the library in castorville to serve both villages
2447032 to avoid a budget deficit next year the city of grandview must eliminate its funding for the grandview symphony our citizens are well aware of the fact that while the grandview symphony orchestra was struggling to succeed our city government promised annual funding to help support its programs last year however private contributions to the symphony increased by 200 percent and attendance at the symphonys concerts in the park series doubled the symphony has also announced an increase in ticket prices for next year such developments indicate that the symphony can now succeed without funding from city government and we can eliminate that expense from next years budget this action will surely prevent a budget deficit
2447033 ten years ago long term car leasing became available in our country of mohilia as an alternative to outright car ownership and leasing has steadily risen in popularity for each of the last five years the number of people leasing new cars has surpassed the number buying new cars the average age of cars driven in mohilia is six years hence if new car leases again outnumber purchases this year it is likely that the majority of drivers will be driving leased not individually owned cars therefore we should change the focus of our business from selling cars to leasing them
2447034 the average annual earnings of high school dropouts are significantly less than the average annual earnings of high school graduates to address this problem the state governor has proposed that the state should establish free vocational training programs for high school dropouts but the availability of such programs would probably encourage some students who would otherwise have graduated to drop out in order to pursue vocational training hence the proposed programs would lower not raise the average earning potential of young people therefore the state should not establish the vocational training programs but should instead focus on improving academic programs in our high schools
2447035 the proportion of children in the united states who are overweight is greater now than ever before obesity rates among children have been increasing since the 1970s and during that same time period the proportion of children living in suburbs has increased whereas children in rural areas tend to have outdoor active chores and children in cities often walk to school or other places they need to go children in suburbs are typically driven everywhere thus the increase in childhood obesity is probably due mainly to the suburbanization of america and the associated decrease in the opportunities children have for exercise
2447036 a group of volunteers participated in a study of consumer responses to the new luxess face cream every morning for a month they washed their faces with mild soap and then applied luxess at the end of that month most volunteers reported a marked improvement in the way their skin looked and felt thus it appears that luxess is truly effective in improving the condition of facial skin
2447037 archaeologists excavated a cave that had been inhabited by prehistoric people for thousands of years these people hunted wild animals many of whose bones were found at levels corresponding to different times of habitation most of the bones at the oldest levels over 40 000 years old were from a deer species whose modern day descendants are known to prefer woodland habitats whereas most of the bones at more recent levels dating from 30 000 to 10 000 years ago were from a gazelle species whose modern day descendants are known to prefer grasslands we can thus conclude that the climate of the area changed dramatically between 40 000 and 30 000 years ago causing the terrain to change from woodland to grassland
2447038 the longhaul trucking company was concerned that its annual accident rate the number of accidents per mile driven was too high it granted a significant pay increase to its drivers and increased its training standards it also put strict limits on the number of hours per week each driver could drive the following year its trucks were involved in half the number of accidents as before the changes were implemented a survey of other trucking companies found that the highest paid drivers were the least likely to have had an accident therefore trucking companies wishing to reduce their accident rate can do so simply by raising their drivers pay and limiting the overall number of hours they drive
2447039 clormium 5 is an odorless tasteless and generally harmless industrial by product that can enter the water supply a preliminary study has linked cooking with water containing clormium 5 to an increased incidence of allergies and skin rashes tests of the drinking water in several areas have revealed the presence of clormium 5 although it is possible to remove clormium 5 from water the costs of routine testing and purification are higher than many communities can afford therefore in order to prevent allergies and skin rashes communities that cannot afford to rid their drinking water of clormium 5 should replace drinking fountains in public buildings such as schools and libraries with bottled water coolers
2447040 in many countries wood is the primary fuel used for heating and cooking but wood smoke can cause respiratory and eye problems and extensive use of wood causes deforestation a major environmental problem in contrast charcoal made by partially burning wood in a controlled process is a fuel that creates less smoke than wood does moreover although charcoal costs slightly more than wood less charcoal is needed to produce the same amount of heat therefore people who use wood as their primary fuel can without experiencing economic hardship switch to charcoal and can thereby improve their health and preserve the environment
2447041 most business analysts for the drugstore industry have stated that even when a nations economy is weak drugstores profits are unlikely to decline appreciably while consumers might put off some kinds of purchases when the economy is slow prescription and over the counter drug purchases are dictated by consumers health needs which are independent of the economy therefore medicine inc is likely to continue to have increasing profits and should plan to open an additional drugstore next year
2447042 our school cafeteria should make changes in the lunches that it serves in order to improve the health of our students several teachers and i have observed that students who eat these meals tend to eat the main course and the dessert but seldom finish the vegetable portion this pattern means that students are missing the vital nutritional benefits of fruits and vegetables which are typically rich in vitamins and minerals therefore the school cafeteria should serve larger fruit and vegetable portions along with smaller main course and dessert portions this change will be effective because according to research conducted at the rose childrens hospital children eat the same amount of food served to them about 55 percent on average no matter what the main course is
2447043 under governor winslows leadership over the past four years myria has enjoyed unprecedented prosperity average wage increases this year are higher than they have been at any time since the 1970s the number of people who report being unemployed has decreased by 10 percent and construction of new homes is up by one third in contrast over the past four years governor winslows opponent mr homer has been mayor of a city in which only a small number of new businesses have opened if myrians want another four years like the past four years they should reelect governor winslow
2447044 mason elementary school is faced with a shortage of classroom space at the same time parents in our district are increasingly expressing the desire to see improvements in their childrens reading abilities therefore we should reduce the number of physical education classes at mason elementary and convert part of the gymnasium to class room space the school will gain the additional space for classrooms without the cost of extending the building and can use the time that students would have spent in physical education classes to provide more reading instruction this plan will lead to improvements in students reading skills
2447045 several major newspapers have recently run articles noting an increased interest in pottery the number of potters in this country has risen by eighteen percent in the past five years and pottery is particularly gaining popularity on college campuses in order to take advantage of these trends christines should immediately begin carrying a larger volume of pottery supplies since several of our stores have recently experienced a decrease in sales of painting supplies all store managers should reallocate shelf space from the painting area for the display of pottery stores should display posters showing pottery that is designed to appeal to college age individuals these actions will undoubtedly increase our profits dramatically
2447046 according to saurias leading nutritional experts a diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in fat is optimal for good health and longevity because this was the diet of the people who lived in ancient sauria one would expect them to have had long and healthy lives yet the mummified remains of saurias ruling classes from two to three thousand years ago show the existence of many medical problems among the ancient saurians including dental problems elevated blood pressure obesity heart disease and early mortality clearly the diet of the ancient saurians was responsible for these problems the high incidence of high blood pressure obesity and heart disease in sauria today even among those who have tried low fat high carbohydrate diets further proves that saurias leading nutritional experts are wrong
2447047 speed limits on our states highways should be eliminated in order to increase our states prosperity because greater speed means more efficient travel commercial deliveries will be faster increasing business profits elimination of speed limits will also make driving more attractive to motorists so that more people will use the highways providing more highway toll revenues for the state at the same time safety on our highways will not be affected daytime speed limits were eliminated last year in the western states of our country and no significant increase in the number of accidents in these states has been reported
2447048 some pharmacies now feature ultrasound machines that screen for an elevated risk of stroke for a fee a technician presses a probe against the neck to determine whether any plaque has thickened the walls of the main artery leading to the brain researchers have shown that a thickening of artery walls is associated with elevated stroke risk and such scans typically find that anywhere from 5 to 20 percent of clients have detectable plaque all pharmacies should offer this service because early detection of increased risk for stroke will encourage clients to consult with their doctors and make important life style changes to reduce their risk of having a stroke this in turn will cause a decrease in overall medical costs in corpora
2447049 dieticians have long known that professional athletes who eat a lot of nuts have higher levels of endurance than those who do not researchers have recently discovered that the particular combination of vitamin n and fiber found in some nuts provides a boost for those who participate in strenuous physical activities daily both vitamin n and fiber supplements are easily synthesized and widely available as a result all those who participate in athletic activities will be able to increase their endurance and win more games by taking vitamin n along with a fiber supplement
2447050 many working parents report that problems related to their childcare arrangements are a major reason for absenteeism from their jobs bridgewell corporation a tele communications company implemented an on site childcare program and after one year the company reported that unscheduled absences had declined by 25 percent since techforce has had an increase in unscheduled employee absences over the past year we should therefore implement our own on site childcare program the program will undoubtedly reduce our unscheduled employee absences resulting in significantly increased productivity
2447051 ten years ago our company had two new regional office buildings built in two different regions the buildings were erected by two different construction companies alpha and zeta even though the two buildings had virtually identical floor plans the building constructed by zeta cost 30 percent more to build and its expenses for maintenance last year were twice those of the building constructed by alpha furthermore the energy consumption of the zeta building has been higher than that of the alpha building every year since its construction such data plus the fact that alpha has a stable workforce with little employee turnover indicate that we should use alpha construction company rather than zeta for all future building projects
2447052 a nationwide survey reveals that the two most desired home features are a bathroom with a whirlpool tub and a large kitchen homes in a nearby development built by our competitor domus construction have whirlpool tubs and have sold much faster and at significantly higher prices than the average to increase our sales and profits we should include whirlpool tubs and larger kitchens as standard features in all our new homes since our recent buyers have voiced no complaints about small yards we can also increase profits by decreasing the size of our yards
2447053 census data indicate that the number of retired couples without children who are moving into sophia county is steadily rising private schools in our county report substantial increases in enrollment and a statewide survey of parents shows that over 10 percent now support the idea of home schooling instead of public schooling funded by the county government such demographic trends suggest that our county will not have to construct new school buildings and that we can therefore decrease the budget for county funded public schools
2447054 a recent study of several nutritional supplements showed that subjects who took a daily pill containing luceen had significantly better vision of distant objects than subjects in the study who took other nutritional supplements luceen appears naturally in a tasty fruit that grows on the island of bonopia and very few inhabitants of that island wear eyeglasses or other corrective lenses such evidence suggests that people who develop vision problems should take regular luceen supplements
2447055 a nationwide survey reveals that a sizeable majority of men would like to see additional sports programs on television after television station wack increased its sports broadcasts its share of the television audience in its viewing area almost doubled to gain a larger audience share in our area and thus increase company profits kick should also revise its broadcast schedule to include more sports coverage
2447056 in a laboratory study of liquid antibacterial hand soaps a concentrated solution of nadasept killed 40 percent more bacteria than the liquid hand soaps currently used in our hospitals during a subsequent test of nadasept at our hospital in saluda that hospital reported significantly fewer cases of patient infection than did any of the other hospitals in our group therefore to prevent serious patient infections we should supply nadasept at all hand washing stations throughout our hospital system
2447057 using a newly developed variety of seed farmers in our neighboring country abundia produced 80 percent more rice last year than in any previous year to increase the income of farmers in our own country we should encourage them to cultivate this new variety of rice rather than some of their traditional crops such high yields of rice will also improve our countrys balance of trade by enabling us to begin exporting it
2447058 the development of an extensive computer based long distance learning program will enhance the reputation of xanadu college this program would allow more students to enroll in our courses thereby increasing our income from student tuition traditional courses could easily be adapted for distance learners as was shown by the adaptation of two traditional courses for our distance learning trial project last year also by using computer programs and taped lectures faculty will have fewer classroom obligations and more time to engage in extensive research thereby enhancing the reputation of xanadu
2447059 despite opposition from some residents of west roseville the arguments in favor of merging the townships of roseville and west roseville are overwhelming first residents in both townships are confused about which authority to contact when they need a service for example the police department in roseville receives many calls from residents of west roseville this sort of confusion would be eliminated with the merger second the savings in administrative costs would be enormous since services would no longer be duplicated we would have only one fire chief one tax department one mayor and so on and no jobs in city government would be lost employees could simply be reassigned most importantly the merger will undoubtedly attract business investments as it did when the townships of hamden and north hamden merged ten years ago
2447060 in recent years liber has unfortunately moved away from its original mission to publish the works of regional small town authors instead of those of big city authors just last year 90 percent of the novels we published were written by authors who maintain a residence in a big city although this change must have been intended to increase profits it has obviously backfired because liber is now in serious financial trouble the only way to address this problem is to return to our original mission if we return to publishing only the works of regional small town authors our financial troubles will soon be resolved
2447061 never once in our 150 year history as a university have we clarified our objectives how then can we hope to adapt as an institution to the new challenges facing higher education as a first step in this evolutionary process therefore we should send out questionnaires asking faculty members why they teach asking students what they want from this university and asking former students what they gained from their own education here when the replies come in we can tabulate them and formulate an official statement of our educational mission this will surely result in improved programs at our university
2447062 at the small nonprofit hospital in the town of saluda the average length of a patients stay is two days at the large for profit hospital in the nearby city of megaville the average patient stay is six days also the cure rate among patients in the saluda hospital is about twice that of the megaville hospital the saluda hospital has more employees per patient than the hospital in megaville and there are few complaints about service at the local hospital such data indicate that treatment in smaller nonprofit hospitals is more economical and of better quality than treatment in larger for profit hospitals
2447063 with continuing publicity about the need for healthful diets and with new research about the harmful effects of eating too much sugar nationwide demand for sugar will no doubt decline therefore farmers in our state should use the land on which they currently grow sugar cane to grow peanuts a food that is rich in protein and low in sugar farmers in the neighboring country of palin greatly increased their production of peanuts last year and their total revenues from that crop were quite high
2447064 last october the city of belleville installed high intensity lighting in its central business district and vandalism there declined almost immediately the city of amburg has recently begun police patrols on bicycles in its business district but the rate of vandalism there remains constant since high intensity lighting is apparently the most effective way to combat crime we should install such lighting throughout amburg by reducing crime in this way we can revitalize the declining neighborhoods in our city
2447065 throughout the country last year as more and more children below the age of nine participated in youth league softball and soccer over 80 000 of these young players suffered injuries when interviewed for a recent study youth league softball players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure from coaches and parents to win games furthermore education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities since the disadvantages apparently outweigh any advantages we in parkville should discontinue organized athletic competition for children under nine
2447066 several recent surveys indicate that homeowners are increasingly eager to conserve energy and manufacturers are now marketing many home appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners that are almost twice as energy efficient as those sold a decade ago also new technologies for better home insulation and passive solar heating are readily available to reduce the energy needed for home heating therefore we anticipate that the total demand for electricity in our area will not increase and may decline slightly since our three electric generating plants in operation for the past 20 years have always met our needs construction of new generating plants should not be necessary
2447067 in the last three quarters of this year under the leadership of our president pat salvo our profits have fallen considerably thus we should ask for her resignation in return for a generous severance package in pats place we should appoint rosa winnings rosa is currently president of starlight jewelry a company whose profits have increased dramatically over the past several years although we will have to pay rosa twice the salary that pat has been receiving it will be well worth it because we can soon expect our profits to increase considerably
2447068 clearly the successful use of robots on missions to explore outer space in the past 20 years demonstrates that robots could be increasingly used to perform factory work more effectively efficiently and profitably than human factory workers the use of robots in factories would offer several advantages first robots never get sick so absenteeism would be reduced second robots do not make mistakes so factories would increase their output finally the use of robots would also improve the morale of factory workers since factory work can be so boring that many workers would be glad to shift to more interesting kinds of tasks
2447069 so that we can better accomplish waymarsh universitys academic goals we should adopt the job opportunity job op program offered at plateau technical college and strongly encourage all students at waymarsh to participate in it the success of the job op program at plateau is evident over the past two years more than 75 of the freshmen at plateau have enrolled in the optional job op program moreover at plateau the grades of job op students are consistently higher than those of other students 90 of the job op students receive job offers within a month after their graduation and most former job op students report much success in their careers
2447070 in the past the body styles of patriot cars have been old fashioned and our cars have not sold as well as have our competitors cars but now since many regions in this country report rapid increases in the numbers of newly licensed drivers we should be able to increase our share of the market by selling cars to this growing population thus we should discontinue our oldest models and concentrate instead on manufacturing sporty cars we can also improve the success of our marketing campaigns by switching our advertising to the youth advertising agency which has successfully promoted the countrys leading soft drink
2447071 because of declining profits we must reduce operating expenses at armchair videos ten video rental stores raising prices is not a good option since we are famous for our special bargains instead we should reduce our operating hours last month our store in downtown marston reduced its hours by closing at 6 00 p m rather than 9 00 p m and reduced its overall inventory by no longer stocking any film released more than two years ago since we have received very few customer complaints about these new policies we should now adopt them at all other armchair video stores as our best strategies for improving profits
2447072 during last years severe drought when the water supply in the grandview city reservoir fell to an extremely low level the city council imposed much more rigid water rationing rules but just after these rules were imposed industrial growth in the area declined this clearly shows that the new rationing rules have hurt industry in grandview therefore to promote the health of the local economy the city council should now stop water rationing
2447073 because of its spectacular natural beauty and consistent climate clearview should be a top choice for anyone seeking a place to retire as a bonus housing costs in clearview have fallen significantly during the past year and real estate taxes remain lower than those in neighboring towns nevertheless clearviews mayor promises many new programs to improve schools streets and public services retirees in clearview can also expect excellent health care as they grow older since the number of physicians in the area is far greater than the national average
2447074 now is the time to invest in a power lift gym franchise so that you can profit from opening one of our gyms in your town consider the current trends power lift gyms are already popular among customers in 500 locations and national surveys indicate increasing concern with weight loss and physical fitness furthermore last years sales of books and magazines on personal health totaled more than 50 million and purchases of home exercise equipment almost doubled investing now in a power lift gym franchise will guarantee a quick profit
2447075 last year sales of our fierce fighter toy airplane declined sharply even though the toy had been a top seller for three years our customer surveys show that parents are now more worried about youthful violence and are concerned about better education for their children therefore to maintain profits we should discontinue all our action toys and focus exclusively on a new line of educational toys several other toy companies have already begun marketing educational toys and report sales increases last year of 200 percent and since the average family income is growing sales of new hyper go toys should also increase
2447076 for the third year in a row the average household income in our country has risen significantly that prosperity means that families are likely to be spending more time and money on leisure activities megamart stores should therefore concentrate on enlarging and promoting its line of products typically used in leisure activities athletic and outdoor equipment televisions gourmet cooking equipment and luggage and travel accessories
2447077 in a recent survey most students who were studying beginning russian gave higher course evaluation ratings to classes taught by non native russian speakers than to classes taught by native russian speakers the reason that the non native speakers were better teachers of russian is easy to see the non native speakers learned russian later in life themselves and so they have a better understanding of how the language can be taught effectively therefore in order to improve instruction for all languages and also save money our university should hire non native speakers as language instructors instead of trying to find and recruit native speakers
2447078 among all students who graduated from hooper university over the past five years more physical science majors than social science majors found permanent jobs within a year of graduation in a survey of recent hooper university graduates most physical science majors said they believed that the prestige of hooper universitys physical science programs helped them significantly in finding a job in contrast social science majors who found permanent employment attributed their success to their own personal initiative therefore to ensure that social science majors find permanent jobs hooper university should offer additional social science courses and hire several new faculty members who already have national reputations in the social sciences
2447079 even though a high percentage of coleville citys businesses failed last year we who live in coleville city should keep in mind the fact that the coleville region has attracted a great many new businesses over the last three years it is well known that new businesses are on average much more likely to fail than are long established ones so the business failures should not be considered a sign of poor economic health indeed many analysts regard the presence of a significant number of new companies among a regions businesses as a sign of economic health thus coleville city appears to be in good not poor economic shape
2447080 sales of better bran have declined in recent years for reasons that management has now identified first better bran is a cereal with high sugar content and recent research studies have found that most consumers say they are concerned about the amount of sugar added to their breakfast cereal second the price of better bran has increased by 5 percent in each of the last three years therefore to increase our companys profits we need to reduce the amount of sugar in better bran and lower better brans price
2447081 during her three years in office governor riedeburg has shown herself to be a worthy leader since she took office crime has decreased the number of jobs created per year has doubled and the number of people choosing to live in our state has increased these trends are likely to continue if she is reelected in addition ms riedeburg has promised to take steps to keep big companies here thereby providing jobs for any new residents anyone who looks at ms riedeburgs record can tell that she is the best qualified candidate for governor
2447082 because the demand for our automobiles is expected to increase dramatically we need to open a new manufacturing plant as soon as possible in order to continue to thrive our marketing projections indicate that 80 million people will want to buy our automobiles yet our existing plant can only produce 40 million automobiles the new plant can be opened on a part time basis with workers from our existing site rotating responsibilities until an operational staff can be trained a major airplane manufacturer was extremely successful using this part time rotating strategy when it opened its new plant five years ago
2447083 in order to attract visitors to central plaza downtown and to return the plaza to its former glory the city should prohibit skateboarding there and instead allow skateboarders to use an area in monroe park at central plaza skateboard users are about the only people one sees now and litter and defaced property have made the plaza unattractive in a recent survey of downtown merchants the majority supported a prohibition on skateboarding in the plaza clearly banning skateboarding in central plaza will make the area a place where people can congregate for fun or for relaxation
2447084 in order to promote economic growth in the city city residents should vote yes on the state governments proposal to build a new expressway linking the outlying suburbs directly to the city center a direct link to the city center will enable downtown businesses to receive deliveries more frequently so that downtown retailers will no longer run out of stock and city manufacturers will not be affected by shortages of materials booming businesses will attract qualified workers from all over the state workers who will be able to take advantage of the new expressway to commute to work in our city in addition to these advantages hundreds of workers will be employed to build the expressway further stimulating the local economy
2447085 our new plan will help us better protect our staff against exposure to toxic chemicals we are fitting each new safety suit with an alarm that will sound in the main control booth when the suit is punctured the control booth will notify the managers on duty who will then take the necessary steps to ensure employees safety in addition to the obvious safety related benefits the fast reaction time will ensure minimal work stoppage and thus result in increased worker productivity and company profitability
2447086 ten years ago as part of a comprehensive urban renewal program the city of transopolis adapted for industrial use a large area of severely substandard housing near the freeway subsequently several factories were constructed there crime rates in the area declined and property tax revenues for the entire city increased to further revitalize the city we should now take similar action in a declining residential area on the opposite side of the city since some houses and apartments in existing nearby neighborhoods are currently unoccupied alternate housing for those displaced by this action will be readily available
2447087 the members of the town school board should not be reelected because they are not concerned about promoting high quality education in the arts in our local schools for example student participation in the high school drama club has been declining steadily and this year the school board refused to renew the contract of the drama director even though he had received many awards for his original plays meanwhile over 300 000 of the high school budget goes to athletic programs and the head football coach is now the highest paid member of the teaching staff
2447088 many popular radio and television commercials use memorable tunes and song lyrics to call attention to the products being advertised indeed a recent study of high school students showed that 85 percent could easily recognize the tunes used to advertise leading soft drinks and fast food restaurants despite our companys extensive advertising in magazines during the past year sales of our home appliances declined therefore to boost company profits we should now switch to advertisements featuring a distinctive song
2447089 the surface of a section of route 101 paved two years ago by mcadam road builders is now badly cracked and marred by dangerous potholes in another part of the state a section of route 66 paved by appian roadways more than four years ago is still in good condition appian roadways has recently purchased state of the art paving machinery and it has hired a new quality control manager because of its superior work and commitment to quality we should contract with appian roadways rather than mcadam road builders to construct the access roads for all our new shopping malls
2447090 there is now evidence that the relaxed manner of living in small towns promotes better health and greater longevity than does the hectic pace of life in big cities businesses in the small town of leeville report fewer days of sick leave taken by individual workers than do businesses in the nearby large city of mason city furthermore leeville has only one physician for its one thousand residents but in mason city the proportion of physicians to residents is five times as high and the average age of leeville residents is significantly higher than that of mason city residents these findings suggest that people seeking longer and healthier lives should consider moving to small communities
2447091 several factors indicate that radio station know should shift its programming from rock and roll music to a continuous news format consider for example the number of older people in our listening area has increased dramatically while the total number of our listeners has recently declined also music stores in our area report decreased sales of recorded music finally continuous news stations in neighboring cities have been very successful and a survey taken just before the recent election shows that local citizens are interested in becoming better informed about politics
2447092 the solano school district should do away with its music education programs after all music programs are not especially popular in our schools only 20 percent of our high school students participated in music programs last year furthermore very few of the solano districts college bound students are interested in majoring in music at the university level also when the school district of our neighboring town of rutherford eliminated its music programs two years ago the overall grade point average in the high school increased by 10 percent the next year surely the money spent on solano music programs could be better used to improve the quality of traditional academic courses
2447093 according to a government report last year the city of dillton reduced its corporate tax rate by 15 percent at the same time it began offering relocation grants and favorable rates on city utilities to any company that would relocate to dillton within 18 months two manufacturing companies moved to dillton where they employ a total of 300 people therefore the fastest way for beauville to stimulate economic development and hence reduce unemployment is to provide tax incentives and other financial inducements that encourage private companies to relocate here
2447094 at nearby green mountain college which has more business courses and more job counselors than does mira vista college 90 percent of last years graduating seniors had job offers from prospective employers but at mira vista college last year only 70 percent of the seniors who informed the placement office that they would be seeking employment had found full time jobs within three months after graduation and only half of these graduates were employed in their major field of study to help mira vistas graduates find employment we must offer more courses in business and computer technology and hire additional job counselors to help students with their resum s and interviewing skills
2447095 when the neighboring town of williamsville adopted a curfew four months ago that made it illegal for persons under the age of 18 to loiter or idle in public places after 10 p m youth crime in williamsville dropped by 27 percent during curfew hours in williamsvilles town square the area where its citizens were once most outraged at the high crime rate not a single crime has been reported since the curfew was introduced therefore to help reduce its own rising crime rate the town of dalton should adopt the same kind of curfew a curfew that keeps young people at home late at night will surely control juvenile delinquency and protect minors from becoming victims of crime
2447096 to serve the housing needs of our students buckingham college should build a new dormitory buckinghams enrollment is growing and based on current trends should double over the next fifty years thus making existing dormitories inadequate moreover the average rent for an apartment in our town has increased in recent years consequently students will find it increasingly difficult to afford off campus housing finally an attractive new dormitory would make prospective students more likely to enroll at buckingham
2447097 when xyz lays off employees it pays delany personnel firm to offer those employees assistance in creating resum s and developing interviewing skills if they so desire laid off employees have benefited greatly from delanys services last year those who used delany found jobs much more quickly than did those who did not recently it has been proposed that we use the less expensive walsh personnel firm in place of delany this would be a mistake because eight years ago when xyz was using walsh only half of the workers we laid off at that time found jobs within a year moreover delany is clearly superior as evidenced by its bigger staff and larger number of branch offices after all last year delanys clients took an average of six months to find jobs whereas walshs clients took nine
2447098 tocombat the recently reported dramatic rise in cheating among college and university students these institutions should adopt honor codes similar to grovetons which calls for students to agree not to cheat in their academic endeavors and to notify a faculty member if they suspect that others have cheated grovetons honor code replaced an old fashioned system in which students were closely monitored by teachers and an average of thirty cases of cheating per year were reported the honor code has proven far more successful in the first year it was in place students reported twenty one cases of cheating five years later this figure had dropped to fourteen moreover in a recent survey conducted by the groveton honor council a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without
2447099 previous experience has shown that our stores are most profitable in areas where residents are highly concerned with leading healthy lives we should therefore build our next new store in plainsville which has many such residents plainsville merchants report that sales of running shoes and exercise clothing are at all time highs the local health club which nearly closed five years ago due to lack of business has more members than ever and the weight training and aerobics classes are always full we can even anticipate a new generation of customers plainsvilles schoolchildren are required to participate in a fitness for life program which emphasizes the benefits of regular exercise at an early age
2447100 seven years ago homeowners in nearby brookville community adopted a set of restrictions on how the communitys yards should be landscaped and what colors the exteriors of homes should be painted since then average property values have tripled in brookville in order to raise property values in deerhaven acres we should adopt our own set of restrictions on landscaping and housepainting
2447101 in megalopolis the number of law school graduates who went to work for large corporate firms declined by 15 percent over the last three years whereas an increasing number of graduates took jobs at small general practice firms even though large firms usually offer much higher salaries law school graduates are choosing to work for the smaller firms most likely because they experience greater job satisfaction at smaller firms in a survey of first year students at a leading law school most agreed with the statement that earning a high salary was less important to them than job satisfaction this finding suggests that the large corporate firms of megalopolis will need to offer graduates more benefits and incentives and reduce the number of hours they must work
2447102 of the two leading real estate firms in our town adams realty and fitch realty adams is clearly superior adams has 40 real estate agents in contrast fitch has 25 many of whom work only part time moreover adams revenue last year was twice as high as that of fitch and included home sales that averaged 168 000 compared to fitchs 144 000 homes listed with adams sell faster as well ten years ago i listed my home with fitch and it took more than four months to sell last year when i sold another home i listed it with adams and it took only one month thus if you want to sell your home quickly and at a good price you should use adams
2447103 given that the number of people in our country with some form of arthritis is expected to rise from 40 million to 60 million over the next twenty years pharmaceutical companies that produce drugs for the treatment of arthritis should be very profitable many analysts believe that in ten years becton pharmaceuticals which makes xenon the best selling drug treatment for arthritis will be the most profitable pharmaceutical company but the patent on xenon expires in three years and other companies will then be able to produce a cheaper version of the drug thus it is more likely that in ten years the most profitable pharmaceutical company will be perkins pharmaceuticals maker of a new drug called xylan which clinical studies show is preferred over xenon by seven out of ten patients suffering from the most extreme cases of arthritis
2447104 a jazz music club in monroe would be a tremendously profitable enterprise currently the nearest jazz club is 65 miles away thus our proposed club the c note would have the local market all to itself plus jazz is extremely popular in monroe over 100 000 people attended monroes jazz festival last summer several well known jazz musicians live in monroe and the highest rated radio program in monroe is jazz nightly which airs every weeknight finally a nationwide study indicates that the typical jazz fan spends close to 1 000 per year on jazz entertainment it is clear that the c note cannot help but make money
2447105 in the next mayoral election residents of clearview should vote for ann green who is a member of the good earth coalition rather than for frank braun a member of the clearview town council because the current members are not protecting our environment for example during the past year the number of factories in clearview has doubled air pollution levels have increased and the local hospital has treated 25 percent more patients with respiratory illnesses if we elect ann green the environmental problems in clearview will certainly be solved
2447106 mesa foods a manufacturer of snack foods that currently markets its products within a relatively small region of the country has strong growth potential mesa enjoyed a 20 percent increase in profits last year and its best selling product diabolique salsa has had increased sales over each of the past three years since omni inc is interested in reaching 14 to 25 year olds the age group that consumes the most snack food we should buy mesa foods and concentrate in particular on marketing diabolique salsa throughout the country
2447107 fifteen years ago omega university implemented a new procedure that encouraged students to evaluate the teaching effectiveness of all their professors since that time omega professors have begun to assign higher grades in their classes and overall student grade averages at omega have risen by thirty percent potential employers apparently believe the grades at omega are inflated this would explain why omega graduates have not been as successful at getting jobs as have graduates from nearby alpha university to enable its graduates to secure better jobs omega university should now terminate student evaluation of professors
2447108 your recent article on corporate downsizing in the united states is misleading the article gives the mistaken impression that many competent workers who lost jobs as a result of downsizing face serious economic hardship often for years before finding other suitable employment but this impression is contradicted by a recent report on the united states economy which found that since 1992 far more jobs have been created than have been eliminated the report also demonstrates that many of those who lost their jobs have found new employment two thirds of the newly created jobs have been in industries that tend to pay above average wages and the vast majority of these jobs are full time
2447109 as a local merchant i wish to support the development of a ski resort in the state park north of our township along with many other merchants who favor the proposal by ski the slopes incorporated i would of course experience a growth in my business but i also know how much more prosperous not to mention lively and interesting our community would be if tourism increased since the main opposition comes from a few environmentalists who do not even live in this community i see no reason to give in to their views the first national bank has finally researched the project and agreed to fund it as a result i see no reason to delay development of the resort
2447110 over 70 percent of the respondents to a recent survey reported that they are required to take more work home with them from the workplace than they were in the past since valu mart has not seen impressive sales in its office supply departments in the past we should take advantage of this work at home trend by increasing at all valu mart stores the stock of home office machines such as printers small copy machines paper shredders and fax machines we will also increase stock of office supplies such as paper pens and staplers with these changes our office supply departments will become the most profitable component of our stores
2447111 in order to save a considerable amount of money rockinghams century old town hall should be torn down and replaced by the larger and more energy efficient building that some citizens have proposed the old town hall is too small to comfortably accommodate the number of people who are employed by the town in addition it is very costly to heat the old hall in winter and cool it in summer the new larger building would be more energy efficient costing less per square foot to heat and cool than the old hall furthermore it would be possible to rent out some of the space in the new building thereby generating income for the town of rockingham
2447112 as a result of numerous consumer complaints of dizziness and nausea promofoods requested that eight million cans of tuna be returned for testing last year promofoods concluded that the cans did not after all contain chemicals that posed a health risk this conclusion is based on the fact that the chemists from promofoods tested samples of the recalled cans and found that of the eight chemicals most commonly blamed for causing symptoms of dizziness and nausea five were not found in any of the tested cans the chemists did find that the three remaining suspected chemicals are naturally found in all other kinds of canned foods
2447113 people should not be misled by the advertising competition between coldex and cold away both popular over the counter cold medications that anyone can purchase without a doctors prescription each brand is accusing the other of causing some well known unwanted side effect coldex is known to contribute to existing high blood pressure and cold away is known to cause drowsiness but the choice should be clear for most health conscious people cold away has been on the market for much longer and is used by more hospitals than is coldex clearly cold away is more effective
2447114 some studies conducted by bronston college which is also located in a small town reveal that both male and female professors are happier living in small towns when their spouses are also employed in the same geographic area therefore in the interest of attracting the most gifted teachers and researchers to our faculty and improving the morale of our entire staff we at pierce university should offer employment to the spouse of each new faculty member we hire although we cannot expect all offers to be accepted or to be viewed as an ideal job offer the money invested in this effort will clearly be well spent because if their spouses have a chance of employment new professors will be more likely to accept our offers
2447115 one year ago we introduced our first product bargain brand breakfast cereal our very low prices quickly drew many customers away from the top selling cereal companies although the companies producing the top brands have since tried to compete with us by lowering their prices and although several plan to introduce their own budget brands not once have we needed to raise our prices to continue making a profit given our success selling cereal bargain brand should now expand its business and begin marketing other low priced food products as quickly as possible
2447116 our poorest selling magazine issues over the past three years were those that featured international news stories on their front covers over the same period competing news magazines have significantly decreased the number of cover stories that they devote to international news moreover the cost of maintaining our foreign bureaus to report on international news is increasing therefore we should decrease our emphasis on international news and refrain from displaying such stories on our magazine covers
2447117 we recommend that grove college preserve its century old tradition of all female education rather than admit men into its programs it is true that a majority of faculty members voted in favor of coeducation arguing that it would encourage more students to apply to grove but eighty percent of the students responding to a survey conducted by the student government wanted the school to remain all female and over half of the alumni who answered a separate survey also opposed coeducation keeping the college all female therefore will improve morale among students and convince alumni to keep supporting the college financially
2447118 all students should be required to take the drivers education course at centerville high school in the past two years several accidents in and around centerville have involved teenage drivers since a number of parents in centerville have complained that they are too busy to teach their teenagers to drive some other instruction is necessary to ensure that these teenagers are safe drivers although there are two driving schools in centerville parents on a tight budget cannot afford to pay for driving instruction therefore an effective and mandatory program sponsored by the high school is the only solution to this serious problem
2447119 a recent study indicates that venadial a new margarine currently produced only in the country of alta actually reduces cholesterol levels derived from the resin of pine trees venadial works by activating a metabolic response that is not yet well understood however cholesterol levels fell ten to fifteen percent among participants in the study who consumed venadial daily and the risk of heart attack by one third in addition the new margarine is so popular that stores in alta are unable to keep it on their shelves therefore if our company obtains the exclusive right to sell venadial internationally our profits are sure to increase substantially within a very short time
2447120 membership in oak citys civic club a club whose primary objective is to discuss local issues should continue to be restricted to people who live in oak city people who work in oak city but who live elsewhere cannot truly understand the business and politics of the city it is important to restrict membership to city residents because only residents pay city taxes and therefore only residents understand how the money could best be used to improve the city at any rate restricting membership in this way is unlikely to disappoint many of the nonresidents employed in oak city since neighboring elm citys civic club has always had an open membership policy and only twenty five nonresidents have joined elm citys club in the last ten years
2447121 in order to save money we at the national brush company have decided to pay our employees for each brush they produce instead of for the time they spend producing brushes we believe that this policy will lead to the production of more and better brushes will allow us to reduce our staff size and will enable the company factories to operate for fewer hours resulting in savings on electricity and security costs these changes will ensure that the best workers keep their jobs and that the company will earn a profit in the coming year
2447122 it would be a mistake to rehire the good taste company to supply the food in our employee cafeteria next year it is the second most expensive caterer in the city in addition its prices have risen in each of the last three years and it refuses to provide meals for people on special diets just last month three employees complained to me that they no longer eat in the cafeteria because they find the experience unbearable our company should instead hire discount foods discount is a family owned local company and it offers a varied menu of fish and poultry i recently tasted a sample lunch at one of the many companies that discount serves and it was delicious an indication that hiring discount will lead to improved employee satisfaction
2447123 many other companies have recently stated that having their employees take the easy read speed reading course has greatly improved productivity one graduate of the course was able to read a five hundred page report in only two hours another graduate rose from an assistant manager to vice president of the company in under a year obviously the faster you can read the more information you can absorb in a single workday moreover easy read costs only 500 per employee a small price to pay when you consider the benefits to acme included in this fee is a three week seminar in spruce city and a lifelong subscription to the easy read newsletter clearly acme would benefit greatly by requiring all of our employees to take the easy read course
2447124 one recent research study has indicated that many adolescents need more sleep than they are getting and another study has shown that many high school students in our city are actually dissatisfied with their own academic performance as a way of combating these problems the high schools in our city should begin classes at 8 30 a m instead of 7 30 a m and end the school day an hour later this arrangement will give students an extra hour of sleep in the morning thereby making them more alert and more productive consequently the students will perform better on tests and other assignments and their academic skills will improve significantly
2447125 one month ago all the showerheads on the first five floors of sunnyside towers were modified to restrict the water flow to approximately 1 3 of its original force although actual readings of water usage before and after the adjustment are not yet available the change will obviously result in a considerable savings for sunnyside corporation since the corporation must pay for water each month except for a few complaints about low water pressure no problems with showers have been reported since the adjustment clearly restricting water flow throughout all the 20 floors of sunnyside towers will increase our profits further
2447126 in a recent telephone survey of automobile factory workers older employees were less likely to report that having a supervisor present increases their productivity among workers aged 18 to 29 27 percent said that they are more productive in the presence of their immediate supervisor compared to 12 percent for those aged 30 or over and only 8 percent for those aged 50 or over clearly if our printing company hires mainly older employees we will increase productivity and save money because of the reduced need for supervisors
2447127 a new discovery warrants a drastic change in the diets of people living in the united states two scientists have recently suggested that omega 3 fatty acids found in some fish and fish oils play a key role in mental health our ancestors who ate less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fat including omega 3 fatty acids were much less likely to suffer from depression than we are today moreover modern societies such as those in japan and taiwan that consume large quantities of fish report depression rates lower than that in the united states given this link between omega 3 fatty acids and depression it is important for all people in the united states to increase their consumption of fish in order to prevent depression
2447128 since college bound students are increasingly concerned about job prospects after graduation foley college should attempt to increase enrollment by promising to find its students jobs after they graduate many administrators feel that this strategy is a way for foley to compete against larger and more prestigious schools and to encourage students to begin preparing for careers as soon as they enter college furthermore a student who must choose a career path within his or her first year of college and who is guaranteed a job after graduation is more likely to successfully complete the coursework that will prepare him or her for the future
2447129 no my desk is next to the door but that is a good point the man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window and his printer is working fine
2447130 okay alan lets press the control and escape keys at the same time
2447131 in a recent study subjects who ate soybeans at least five times per week had significantly lower cholesterol levels than subjects who ate no soy products by fortifying our wheat o cereal with soy protein we can increase sales by appealing to additional consumers who are concerned about their health this new version of wheat o should increase company profits and at the same time improve the health of our customers
2447132 after a major airline chose yorkville as its regional flight hub the number of businesses in that city almost doubled and local tax revenue increased by 50 percent in addition as travel to yorkville became easier most respondents to a survey of the countrys top executives identified yorkville as a desirable place to transact business to secure efficient transportation for tudor city and stimulate our local economy we should build a new airport like the one in yorkville that is suitable for a regional flight hub
2447133 according to a recent study people with many social ties report catching colds less often than do people with few social ties consequently researchers conclude that having an active social life probably helps strengthen the immune system the researchers note that catching a cold one of a family of highly contagious viruses gives the cold sufferer temporary immunity to that virus in the future but not to the many other related viruses merely being exposed to a new cold virus however is not enough for a person to catch a cold since a strong immune system can successfully fight off some new viruses thus in order to prevent catching a cold people should strengthen their immune systems by becoming more active socially
2447134 the eliot valley region was primarily agricultural twenty years ago in the past twenty years however many computer chip manufacturers have opened factories there a recent study found that water pollution in the region was worse than in any other region in the country moreover the computer chip factories which use large quantities of water to manufacture the chips are probably responsible for the low levels of water in the regions lakes and reservoirs therefore if the regions computer chip makers had limits placed on the amount of water they could use water quality would improve
2447135 seatown has a large port exclusively for fishing boats whose owners pay fees for the upkeep of the docks and for facilities for cleaning engines and repairing nets in recent years declining fish populations have decreased fishing revenue and forced many owners to stop fishing altogether as a result the port has a high vacancy rate and port managers are considering allowing pleasure boats including cruise ships and other large vessels to use the port in order to increase revenue but allowing pleasure boats into the port would be a mistake because the fishing boats would be forced out of the port we should preserve the port for the fishing fleet which unlike pleasure boats contributes to the prosperity of seatown
2447136 the brenton power plant draws water from scotts river for its cooling system and releases the warmed water back into the river the town council recommends that the plant install a more efficient cooling system that uses less water claiming it will be more environmentally sound however in uptown where the new system is used a study found that the complex network of pipes in the new system tends to accumulate algae the build up of algae can be avoided by scrubbing the pipes which is costly or by adding an herbicide to the water in the pipes to prevent algae accumulation but water containing the herbicide cannot be released back into the river and it is known that low water levels can harm river ecosystems accustomed to higher levels therefore brenton power plant should continue to use the old cooling system exclusively
2447137 twenty years ago pine city established strict laws designed to limit the number of new buildings that could be constructed in the city since that time the average housing prices in pine city have increased considerably chestnut city which is about the same size as pine city has over the past twenty years experienced an increase in average housing prices similar to pine city but chestnut city never established any laws that limit new building construction so it is clear that laws limiting new construction have no effect on average housing prices so if maple city were to establish strict laws that limit new building construction these laws will have no effect on average housing prices
2447138 it appears that the lighting in sherwood highs classrooms which have large windows but minimal overhead light sources is impairing student academic performance and teacher morale records show that during december and january the two months with the fewest hours of daylight attendance rates fall average daily class participation drops and grades decline teacher resignations are also highest during these months according to a study of tundra vocational school which experiences entire seasons with little daylight students grade point averages increased when day glow light bulbs which mimic sunlight were installed in classrooms this study suggests that sherwood can improve students academic performance and teachers morale by using day glow light bulbs in winter
2447139 a recent study of dura sock wearers suggests that our company is wasting the money it spends on its patented
2447140 franklin airport which is on a bay is notorious for flight delays the airport management wants to build new runways to increase capacity but can only do so by filling in 900 acres of the bay the bay coalition organization objects that filling in the bay will disrupt tidal patterns and harm wildlife but the airport says that if it is permitted to build its new runways it will fund the restoration of 1 000 acres of wetlands in areas of the bay that have previously been damaged by industrialization this plan should be adopted for it is necessary to reduce the flight delays and the wetlands restoration part of the plan ensures that the bays environment will actually be helped rather than hurt
2447141 three years ago so low launched a nationwide ad campaign focusing heavily on sunny regions and distributing free sunglasses there but although so low sunglasses cost less than higher priced brands they block a smaller proportion of the suns rays including the type of rays known to damage the eyes even when the person wearing the sunglasses feels no discomfort a recent study suggests that so low sunglasses can actually increase the risk of damage to peoples eyes by creating a false sense of security the study shows a sharp increase in the incidence of vision problems in the sunny regions over the past three years these findings suggest that anyone concerned about eye damage from the sun should avoid so low brand and instead either pay for higher priced brands or wear no sunglasses at all
2447142 a popular fashion magazine recently conducted a survey of consumers opinions about clothing prices using prepaid mailing envelopes
2447143 the new grocery town store in elm city located near a new residential development has a high low pricing policy where average prices are relatively high but deep discounts are offered on some items in weekly specials this store has been showing increased profits every month as the nearby residential development gets closer to full capacity it follows that people prefer a pricing policy where they can find bargains on specific items since there is a new residential development planned in oak city we should change the pricing policy at all of our oak city stores from our current everyday low prices policy to a high low policy this will increase the profits at all of our stores in oak city
2447144 over 70 percent of the respondents to a recent survey reported that they are required to take more work home with them from the workplace than they were in the past since valu mart has not seen impressive sales in its office supply departments in the past we should take advantage of this work at home trend by increasing at all valu mart stores the stock of home office machines such as printers small copy machines paper shredders and fax machines we will also increase stock of office supplies such as paper pens and staplers with these changes our office supply departments will become the most profitable component of our stores
2447145 various sources are predicting higher than average temperatures across the country next winter including in sun city the traditional location of our yearly winter conference higher winter temperatures are sure to result in higher than usual tourism in sun city a location already known for its attractive beaches and good weather hotels will have fewer rooms available transportation will be more difficult to reserve and public places such as parks and restaurants will be more crowded these conditions are likely to significantly reduce attendance at the conference we should therefore move our conference to a city less popular with winter tourists
2447146 traffic problems here in waymarsh are obviously reaching record levels while just three months ago it would take me 15 minutes to get to work it now takes closer to 25 waymarsh should follow the example of our neighboring city gearsville last year gearsville implemented a policy that rewards people who share rides to work with coupons for free gas pollution levels in gearsville have dropped since the policy was implemented and several friends who live in gearsville tell me that their trip to work is quicker than it used to be with the terrible traffic and high pollution in waymarsh we must implement a policy similar to gearsvilles
2447147 a ten year nationwide study of the effectiveness of wearing a helmet while bicycling indicates that ten years ago approximately 35 percent of all bicyclists reported wearing helmets whereas today that number is nearly 80 percent another study however suggests that during the same ten year period the number of accidents caused by bicycling has increased 200 percent these results demonstrate that bicyclists feel safer because they are wearing helmets and they take more risks as a result thus to reduce the number of serious injuries from bicycle accidents the government should concentrate more on educating people about bicycle safety and less on encouraging or requiring bicyclists to wear helmets
2447148 all of our customer service employees recently attended a two day retreat during which they received retraining in effective customer service subsequently cyberells employee performance study showed that the retreat benefited new employees those who have worked with cyberell for less than two years far more than it did experienced employees according to the study after the retreat new employees were able to handle an average of ten percent more calls per hour and the total number of customer complaints about new employees decreased but experienced employees showed little improvement in these areas therefore cyberell should send only new employees to future retreats and should use the resulting savings to double the length of the retreats so that the retreats will be more likely to yield optimum employee performance
2447149 fifteen years ago pine city launched an electricity conservation program that reimbursed residents some of the cost for replacing energy wasteful motors home office equipment and home appliances with energy efficient ones for ten years spending on this program increased annually and annual total energy consumption declined but spending on the program began to decline five years ago and since then pine citys total electricity consumption has increased sharply if this increased usage continues the city will have to build a costly new power plant obviously the best way to avoid this expense is to increase reimbursement to residents for replacing energy wasteful equipment this will reduce energy usage to the levels of five years ago
2447150 eating a heavy meal may increase the risk of heart attack a recent survey of 2 000 people who had had a heart attack revealed that 158 of them said they had eaten a heavy meal within 24 hours before their heart attack and 25 of them said they had eaten a heavy meal within 2 hours before their heart attack eating and digesting food releases hormones into the bloodstream and temporarily increases heart rate and blood pressure slightly both of these things put stress on the heart therefore people who are at risk of having a heart attack can lower that risk by not overeating
2447151 to expand the home delivery service of our national newspaper we should concentrate on the state of urba rather than on the state of sylva first the population of sylva is more widely dispersed which would require us to spend more money to deliver our papers in that area resulting in less profit per customer second a long term study of television viewing habits suggests that sylvans prefer local to national news since they spend twice as much time viewing local news programs as they do viewing national programs finally because events in urba receive more coverage in our newspaper than do events in sylva we can expect urbans to be more interested in reading our newspaper
2447152 whereas appleby college holds class reunions every five years edelston college holds annual reunions for all classes during which edelstons alumni are treated to banquets lectures and student performances enhancing their loyalty to the college and their willingness to donate money edelston college receives most of its alumni donations during or shortly after these reunions therefore the best way for appleby to increase its alumni donations is to offer similar reunion activities and to have each graduating class hold annual reunions
2447153 it has long been believed that getting at least eight hours of sleep a night is good for health but a recent six year study of adult sleeping habits found that people who reported sleeping eight or more hours a night had a higher rate of certain health problems than did those who reported sleeping seven hours a night people who reported sleeping five hours a night also had an increased rate of the health problems but this increase was slight compared to that for people who reported sleeping eight or more hours a night clearly people should try to get seven hours of sleep and they should worry more about getting too much sleep than too little
2447154 in an effort to improve our employees productivity we should implement electronic monitoring of employees internet use from their workstations employees who use the internet from their workstations need to be identified and punished if we are to reduce the number of work hours spent on personal or recreational activities such as shopping or playing games by installing software to detect employees internet use on company computers we can prevent employees from wasting time foster a better work ethic at climpson and improve our overall profits
2447155 to address the parking problems in our downtown business district it has been proposed that the city increase parking capacity by building a four story parking garage however this project would cost more than it would to improve the downtown pedestrian plaza because the pedestrian plaza is an important attraction that draws people to the downtown area improvements to it will increase business for downtown merchants the merchants higher profits will ultimately produce increased tax revenues for the city therefore we should invest in the plaza improvements first and then use the revenues thus generated to pay for the construction of the parking garage
2447156 a recent study reported that pet owners have longer healthier lives on average than do people who own no pets specifically dog owners tend to have a lower incidence of heart disease in light of these findings sherwood hospital should form a partnership with sherwood animal shelter to institute an adopt a dog program the program would encourage dog ownership for patients recovering from heart disease which will help reduce medical costs by reducing the number of these patients needing ongoing treatment in addition the publicity about the program will encourage more people to adopt pets from the shelter which will reduce the risk of heart disease in the general population

2447170 d por sentado que acatar la decisi n del tribunal constitucional
2447171 dentro de la legalidad se est n cerrando todas las puertas
2447172 la respuesta que se est dando por parte de zapatero a la cuesti n de la consulta es desproporcionada unilateral y dif cilmente entendible
2447173 rodr guez zapatero ha tomado la decisi n unilateral y personal de suspender la consulta porque aqu su voluntad es imponer que los vascos no podamos hacer nada que desde madrid no quieren que hagamos ya nos han dicho en m s de una ocasi n que no tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro futuro y ahora nos est n diciendo que no tenemos derecho ni siquiera a opinar
2447174 es lo que estamos defendiendo en las reuniones que estamos manteniendo con el resto de formaciones pol ticas queremos convencerles de que la consulta se tiene que hacer y desgraciadamente a d a de hoy el pnv ya dej sentado que ellos van a acatar la decisi n del tc que es lo mismo que decir que no van a empujar para que la consulta se haga
2447175 paso importante en torno a la cuesti n de la materializaci n del derecho a decidir
2447176 si nos cierran esta v a inventaremos nuevas v as
2447177 es quiz esa falta de unidad o de uniformidad en las opciones de otras formaciones pol ticas las que impiden que proyectos importantes como el de ley de consulta no hayan sido socializados
2447178 es sacar el derecho a decidir del centro del debate pol tico y por eso es tan importante para zapatero que el pr ximo ejecutivo vasco no sea nacionalista
2447179 un candidato teledirigido desde madrid no va a defender los intereses de los vascos
2447180 se va a dedicar m s a las genuflexiones ante zapatero y el gobierno espa ol que a empujar por las necesidades de los vascos
2447181 desde madrid se rechazan sistem ticamente las iniciativas que se aprueban con el respaldo mayoritario del parlamento vasco
2447182 los vascos no se pueden permitir un lehendakari que no cree en el derecho a decidir
2447183 tendr a que haber un art culo en el estatuto o en la constituci n que excluyera expresamente esa posibilidad
2447184 una reflexi n en profundidad entre los partidos las formaciones pol ticas sindicales asociaciones etc porque se nos est cerrando el futuro y tenemos un cors que nos aprieta demasiado
2447185 ese pueblo siempre ha acatado y actuado sometido a la legalidad pero tambi n tenemos que ser conscientes de que dentro de esa legalidad se nos han ido cerrando todas las puertas no tenemos margen de evoluci n de desarrollo como pueblo y va siendo hora de abrir un debate estrat gico entre las formaciones pol ticas para dar pasos en otro sentido de superaci n del actual marco jur dico y creo sinceramente que tenemos que colaborar las formaciones pol ticas que somos independentistas
2447186 situado en el centro del debate pol tico el derecho a decidir
2447187 las negociaciones contin an no se han terminado y seguiremos ma ana
2447188 estamos dispuestos a sentarnos a negociar con todas las partes pero primero debe haber un alto al fuego

2447217 los acontecimientos de ayer entre georgia y rusia al hilo de la distracci n planetaria que representan unos juegos ol mpicos hacen temer una guerra real de consecuencias imprevisibles en una regi n tan inflamable y llena de agravios como el c ucaso en la que la peque a y prooccidental georgia representa una pieza estrat gica que conecta el petr leo del caspio con europa
2447218 de ah la alarmada reacci n de washington la ue y la otan
2447219 el c ucaso es una zona explosiva y nadie puede dudar del desenlace del conflicto si mosc decide implicarse a fondo militarmente
2447220 lo peor que podr a ocurrir en este escenario es que el t ndem medv dev putin est dispuesto a poner a prueba hasta qu punto llega esa entente de eeuu y la ue con su enemigo georgiano
2447221 los enfrentamientos en el c ucaso ponen de manifiesto que la tregua ol mpica no es m s que una leyenda
2447222 la violencia amenaza con extenderse a toda la regi n en forma de una guerra tnica y territorial similar a la que sacudi los balcanes
2447223 la tensi n y los ataques se han visto avivados desde la proclamaci n de independencia de kosovo que gener un precedente en todos los movimientos separatistas y puso de manifiesto la incoherencia pol tica de la ue
2447224 bruselas permiti irresponsablemente la secesi n kosovar pero se opone a la independencia de osetia del sur
2447225 los combates en osetia del sur acompa ados de la intoxicaci n informativa marcan un punto de peligrosa inflexi n en el conflicto entre georgia y rusia
2447226 el c ucaso es uno de los patios traseros de rusia con estados como georgia que aspiran a unir su suerte a la de la otan
2447227 un motivo a adido de preocupaci n para una rusia en fase de recuperaci n de su autoestima y de su influencia

2447229 el choque de intereses y fronteras de rusia y georgia ha desatado un inquietante conflicto armado en la explosiva zona del c ucaso con osetia del sur como campo de batalla
2447230 la reciente independencia de kosovo en los balcanes bajo los auspicios de eeuu y la ue ha dado nuevos argumentos a los separatistas osetios
2447231 a este giro no son ajenos los movimientos de rusia para afianzarse en una regi n de indudable importancia geoestrat gica

2447257 come musicista ho sempre avuto la passione per il jazz e tutto ci che lo circonda quando ero ragazzo ascoltavo anche molto il cantautorato di quegli anni mi piacevano claudio lolli fabrizio de andr ivano fossati ma ascoltando jazz avevo un po approccio diverso alla musica commerciale

2447276 not only is the origin of the fetuses immoral and inhumane there are medical problems and complications associated with the injections
2447277 this savage and repulsive brave new world of human sacrifices in the quest for eternal youth is a prime example of the end results when all moral boundaries are destroyed

2447292 this is the true joy in life the being used for a purpose recognised by yourself as a mighty one the being thoroughly worn out before you are thrown on the scrap heap the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy

2447311 ze waren niet op zoek naar mij maar naar een andere bewoner die niet aanwezig was deze heeft zich later gemeld en zat korte tijd vast
2447312 ik heb nog met de politie staan praten maar ze waren helemaal niet in mij ge nteresseerd ik heb er ook nooit iets van gemerkt dat de politie mij als een verdachte zou hebben gezien

2447315 the uk does remain subject to high levels of covert non military activity by foreign intelligence organisations they are increasingly combining traditional intelligence methods with new technical attacks for example attempting to penetrate computer networks via the internet
2447316 this should be sufficient to treat a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2447317 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession the government urgently needs to step in
2447318 i have said on a number of occasions that we are looking at all the options and stamp duty is one of them but ive also always said that stamp duty and removing it in itself may not kick start the market in the way that people think it might stamp duty represents a small amount of the upfront costs so we have to look at all these issues
2447319 bumped into making a decision before the pre budget report
2447320 what we have done is put 10m behind more debt advice for people 90 per cent of our county courts now have free legal advice and we know that if people get the right advice something like 85 per cent of repossessions can be avoided but we are also looking at more ways in which we can help people facing difficulties
2447321 the governments position on stamp duty is a toxic combination of chaos and denial
2447322 the government must create a statutory code of practice to ensure that lenders only ever repossess as a last resort if we are to avoid the mass repossessions we saw during the tory recession of the 1990s
2447323 there was no previous work done on an archive like the omagh bombs

2447327 i realise its a sensitive time and different people will react differently but i cant legislate for how some families are going to react
2447328 i very much respect the decision of individual family members not to attend
2447329 it was always going to be very difficult to get 100 per cent consensus around what the council should or shouldnt do but we consulted widely and we took the best decision that we could

2447340 i have lived there throughout all the previous conflicts including the war in the early 1990s and they were always fought by soldiers against other soldiers
2447341 now the difference is that its the civilian population thats taking the brunt of the aggression
2447342 i saw bodies on the streets in cars its impossible to count them there is hardly a single building undamaged

2447356 noi il biglietto non lo facciamo mai e della multa non ci frega niente
2447357 perch quando becchiamo un cazzone come te nessuno ci crede e allora meglio avere testimoni
2447358 il biglietto non lo facciamo mai e della multa non ci frega niente
2447359 in genere come con le cartine quando stanno per finire ti organizzi magari rallenti il ritmo del resto se stai finendo i verbali vuol dire che ne hai fatti troppi o meglio ne hai fatti abbastanza per esserti guadagnato la giornata

2447449 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2447450 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left kewell has gone aurelio is injured and leto cannot get a work permit
2447451 babel is away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area
2447452 england is still in the back of my mind i want to be in the squad and playing for fulham can only help that
2447453 i only played a limited amount of games and when i did play i was up there on my own and could not get going
2447454 i played for england when i was in the championship with crystal palace so i dont think being at fulham is a factor
2447455 it was ideal preparation because it was a pacy game
2447456 we wanted an intense game and i think ajax gave us more than we wanted they fought for every ball and played well
2447457 in the whole game we were always dangerous going forward but they took advantage of two lapses of concentration and scored two fantastic goals
2447458 some players are still a bit short physically but i am not really concerned
2447459 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2447460 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service

2447498 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde
2447499 insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2447500 wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt
2447501 sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der em 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg
2447502 no thank you were on our way to view the mosque
2447503 its a shame that the hagia sophia closes so early have you seen the cisterna basilica yet its still open
2447504 yes thats one of the things ive wanted to see
2447505 let me show you where the entrance is its just a block from here
2447506 i know but it is really no trouble and will save you some time how long are you in turkey for
2447507 the entrance is just here make sure that you walk through all of the passages some people just go into the cisterna take a look and then come back up there is a whole passage to follow and youll see the pillars of minerva and eventually come out about a block down the street
2447508 ill wait for you at the exit in case youd like to have a glass of tea and see our showroom there wont be any pressure for you to buy anything but as long as youre in istanbul you should get to know what types of things are on sale
2447509 thank you but were not buying anything today if we buy anything it will be on our last day
2447510 i didnt say anything about buying anything after all no one needs to buy a rug but this will just give you a chance to get educated and no museums or mosques will be open at that time anyhow and it will be too early for dinner
2447511 did you get to take any pictures can i see them
2447512 and now maybe you would honor me by taking some time to have a glass of tea relax and learn about turkish carpets my shop is just 20 meters this way
2447513 come sit down let me explain the different types of rugs to you and educate you so youll know a good rug from a cheap one here have some tea
2447514 you know no one comes to turkey to buy a rug its not something that you need yet most people end up buying one why because its art its something they decide that they like and its something that they will have and enjoy for the rest of their lives a good rug will last for over 100 years
2447515 you know we really do need to replace the rug in the dining room sometime as well as the rug in rosies our daughter room but we do not need to purchase a rug at this time
2447516 if you could have one of these rugs and if you didnt have to pay for it can you see any of them working in your room
2447517 you have very good taste that rug is 100 wool look here thats how you can tell that they dyes are natural and not artificial look at the weave this is how you can tell it is not machine made it takes someone three to four months working full time to make a rug like this
2447518 i know that you are not looking to purchase a rug in the summer i would start off with a price of around 3 000 for this rug and we would easily sell it for more than 2 500 but if you were interested at all id offer you this rug at 1 800
2447519 thank you but we really are not interested in purchasing a rug right now
2447520 nearly everyone who comes to turkey is not interested in buying a rug but you know nearly everyone who comes ends up buying one because they find something that they really like something that is going to last them the rest of their lives and something that they will forever remember their trip to turkey with
2447521 is there any price where if you could own this rug for that price you would walk out of here happy
2447522 yes and you may end up not purchasing one but is there any price where you would say i am happy to buy that rug
2447523 i guess if i could have that rug for 800 id probably be happy
2447524 this is a rug that i would be selling in the summer for over 2 500 but you know
2447525 you are a very lucky young lady to have a father who has the means and the desire to purchase something like this for you that you really want i hope you appreciate him
2447526 wait a minute thats a line that ive used in sales training before that comes right from joe girardi
2447527 im in education but i used to sell and i used to train sales people
2447528 i think we can come to a deal how about 1 500 for the rug
2447529 i really didnt come here to buy a rug i said that id be happy to purchase the rug for 800 but it really wasnt my intent to purchase one
2447530 i just cannot sell it for 1 000 lets say we have a deal at 1 100
2447531 oh this is the reciprocation technique dont feel that you need to reciprocate only purchase if you want the item
2447532 it was not natural fire faris realized it blazed pale gold and green menarys wild halo in its own way it was beautiful as cold and strange as the northern lights

2447534 be careful if you dont know where youre going because you might not get there
2447535 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2447536 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2447537 they got their freedom back after having been in captivity for a long time the local elders and puntland authorities helped their release
2447538 they are now in bossaso and will be soon flown to their country
2447539 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2447540 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2447541 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2447542 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2447543 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2447544 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2447545 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2447546 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2447547 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2447548 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2447549 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2447550 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2447551 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2447552 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2447553 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2447554 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2447555 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2447556 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2447557 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2447558 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2447559 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2447560 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2447561 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2447562 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2447563 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2447564 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2447565 we are on the 5th floor at the comics connection
2447566 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2447567 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2447568 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2447569 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2447570 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2447571 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2447572 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2447573 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2447574 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2447575 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2447576 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2447577 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2447578 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2447579 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2447580 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2447581 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2447582 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2447583 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2447584 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2447585 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2447586 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2447587 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2447588 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2447589 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2447590 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2447591 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2447592 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2447593 there are still lots of young writers artists photographers who come here for the seclusion of the dunes
2447594 i imagine that if youre working on a book you dont want to hear things like the 80 harley davidsons we had going down the main street of provincetown i couldnt even hear the phone on my desk
2447595 i had a big wild turkey blocking my way in here the other day
2447596 i sat here waiting for him to move and he just stared at me finally i had to get out and shoo him away
2447597 but there were as many as 40 over the years noreasters winds have taken a lot of em down some burned down some just fell down
2447598 there was a cement company here in the 1940s and legend has it that the office of that company is still buried out here somewhere when they open the shacks at the beginning of the season
2447599 its not unusual to have to shovel the sand out of them
2447600 they control the renting of the shacks if you want to apply you have to buy an annual membership its about 50 then if your name is selected you can take the shack for a week or two weeks
2447601 sometimes when were driving along the trails therell be a broom handle with an envelope stuck on it inside the envelope itll have a grocery list and a cheque and well take it downtown and pick up the stuff
2447602 there are blueberry bushes bayberry lichens scrub oak rose hips the portuguese people in provincetown pick the berries and boil them for rose hip tea very very high in vitamin c
2447603 and there are whitetail deer red fox snakes hawks osprey lots of coyotes theyre going to have to do something about that situation pretty soon the coyotes are starting to come into town at night and take domestic pets
2447604 my nephew made 21 000 on six fish he caught here
2447605 tunas the smallest was 400 pounds the biggest was 900 pounds
2447606 that means there are some environmental people out here doing some type of study on the vegetation
2447607 the beach is closed when the piping plovers are nesting
2447608 its an endangered seabird and the minute the rangers spot one of the nests they close the whole beach to vehicles you can still walk on the beach but you cant drive on it
2447609 it behooves me to advise clients of anything i know about which might affect their property values
2447610 as realtors we have resources that our clients dont always have
2447611 ik had steeds het idee de slechtste man in koers te zijn maar dat kan niet als je de hele dag op kop rijdt ik heb mijn werk voor de ploeg kunnen doen we hebben nooit achter de feiten aan hoeven te rijden en uiteindelijk zijn onze beste mensen in koers gebleven

2447615 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2447616 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2447617 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2447686 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2447687 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2447688 the power of art has the ability to engage in a different language what the future of vermont might be
2447689 is the artist going to pick up on the roads or the cost of living or the native vermonter every artist is very personal so likely everyone will focus on something different

2447697 momenteel sta ik 15e van alle deelnemers een plaats in de halve finales zou haalbaar moeten zijn
2447698 zo goed zelfs dat ik soms bang ben ik heb enorm hard gewerkt hopelijk werpt dat straks vruchten af
2447699 alles is er om een goed resultaat neer te zetten
2447700 op de 100 meter vrije slag zou een halve finale moeten lukken maar voor mezelf heb ik mijn contract vervuld als ik een belgisch record kan neerzetten
2447701 tegen borisov werd vaak met de lange bal gespeeld dat is niet echt mijn spel

2447717 clearly there is an increase in the number of women who use violence in their everyday lives and when they are out drinking on the streets around the country
2447718 its a new phenomenon and it does stretch the resources of the police service
2447719 it is the kind of entrepreneurially eccentric idea that writers of a depression era federal guide to vermont found flourishing back then a kind of creative chutzpah
2447720 georgien steht unter der direkten attacke und aggression der russischen f deration sie haben die invasion begonnen

2447723 we have filed a complaint with the police here our delegation leader also informed the us homeland security officials and the indian embassy about the four missing students there
2447724 if the us police seek our assistance we can help otherwise we can only forward the matter to the ministry concerned
2447725 we dont know where these four students went our nasa project was about rockets
2447726 the school is responsible for the missing students i dont know how this happened but from my relatives i have come to know that my son is in california

2447734 i got a message from clarko to push forward and just hang around there and see if you can kick a goal
2447735 i did feel the pressure going back more so from the crowd than anything
2447736 i didnt kick it that well but i reckon the crowd pushed that through so it was a perfect way to end whats been a fantastic week and a great day for our club
2447737 we dont like to have that attitude but when youve got a significant margin you can take the chance and push the guy forward
2447738 he had a long way to come from so we were anticipating bradshaw might get a mark late in the game
2447739 sure enough he did but fortunately he missed the goal
2447740 at first i didnt want to make people uncomfortable in interviews i didnt want to come off rude or arrogant now i just really dont care
2447741 then i just didnt know how to execute what i wanted
2447742 i have never felt at home in one demographic thats my struggle with management and my label getting everyone to identify that just because im african american that doesnt mean that im an urban artist i make music for people that have a sophisticated ear and are brave enough to support something non traditional people complain about the state of music but there are alot of diverse and talented artists with people that support them but their fans arent the ones calling the radio station they just want to see a good show so i said we should just do a tour and all of the artists that are going to be a part of it will have the same voice and stance on music so we janelle monae chester french the knux and i got all of our managers on the phone and started making a tour happen its in the very early stages but were trying to put something together

2447757 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that sen mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president

2447774 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2447775 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2447776 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2447777 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2447778 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2447779 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2447780 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2447781 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2447782 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2447783 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products

2447791 wir werden 2009 mit einer lithium ionen batterie im smart die n chste stufe z nden
2447792 das sind nicht nur ank ndigungen das werden wir auch tun
2447793 das ist f r eine leistungsf hige lithium ionen batterie kein problem 100 kilometer reichweite trauen wir unserem smart elektrofahrzeug sicher zu
2447794 berlin ist dabei sehr interessant auch paris oder rom k men infrage wir sprechen mit verschiedenen interessenten
2447795 wir haben schon vor monaten die entsprechend weichen gestellt dass wir massiv in die zukunftsthemen investieren
2447796 das kostet nat rlich geld aber vorstand und aufsichtsrat sind dazu fest entschlossen
2447797 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2447798 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2447799 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2447800 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2447801 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2447802 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2447803 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2447804 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2447805 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2447806 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2447807 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital

2447810 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2447811 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2447812 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2447813 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2447814 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2447815 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2447816 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2447817 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2447818 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2447819 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2447820 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2447821 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2447822 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2447823 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2447824 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2447825 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2447826 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2447827 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2447828 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2447829 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2447830 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2447831 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2447832 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2447833 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2447834 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2447835 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2447836 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2447837 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2447838 just so you all know we did set a record
2447839 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2447840 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2447841 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2447842 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2447843 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2447844 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2447845 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2447846 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2447847 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2447848 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2447849 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2447850 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2447851 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2447852 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2447853 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2447854 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2447855 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2447856 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2447857 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2447858 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2447859 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
2447860 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2447861 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2447862 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2447863 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2447864 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2447865 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2447866 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2447867 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2447868 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2447869 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2447870 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2447871 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2447872 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2447873 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2447874 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2447875 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2447876 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2447877 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2447878 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2447879 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2447880 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2447881 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2447882 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2447883 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2447884 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2447885 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2447886 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2447887 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2447888 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2447889 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2447890 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2447891 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2447892 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2447893 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2447894 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2447895 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2447896 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2447897 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2447898 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2447899 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2447900 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2447901 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2447902 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2447903 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2447904 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2447905 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan

2447907 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2447908 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2447909 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2447910 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2447911 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2447912 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2447913 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2447914 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2447915 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2447916 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2447917 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2447918 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2447919 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2447920 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2447921 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2447922 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2447923 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2447924 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2447925 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2447926 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2447927 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2447928 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2447929 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2447930 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2447931 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2447932 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2447933 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to

2447935 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2447936 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2447937 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2447938 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2447939 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2447940 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2447941 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2447942 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2447943 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2447944 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2447945 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2447946 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2447947 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2447948 the influence of polling location on voting found in our research would be more than enough to change the outcome of a close election
2447949 voting at a school could increase support for school spending or voting at a church could decrease support for stem cell initiatives
2447950 environmental cues such as objects or places can activate related constructs within individuals and influence the way they behave
2447951 voting in a school for example could activate the part of a persons identity that cares about kids or norms about taking care of the community similarly voting in a church could activate norms of following church doctrine such effects may even occur outside an individuals awareness
2447952 we want factors like political views whether someone thinks a candidate is going to make our country a better place to sway elections
2447953 but in forming election policy we also want to make sure that arbitrary factors such as polling location dont ultimately influence voting behaviors
2447954 what our research suggests is that it might be useful to further investigate influences such as polling location to better understand how such factors affect different types of voting situations

2447963 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2447964 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2447965 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2447966 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2447967 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2447968 einen allgemeinen und systematischen angriff gegen die zivilbev lkerung geleitet
2447969 das vorgehen st rt wenn berhaupt das verh ltnis zwischen politik diplomatie und strafgerichtsbarkeit
2447970 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2447971 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2447972 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2447973 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2447974 wir k nnen auch ein bier gemeinsam trinken so schlimm ist es doch nicht
2447975 diese st ndigen streitigkeiten um macht und geld geh ren endlich beendet
2447976 schon im vorfeld heftig in den kulissen geschoben damit spoerr den posten behalten kann
2447977 ich glaube nicht dass wir die n tige mehrheit erhalten werden
2447978 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2447979 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2447980 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2447981 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2447982 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2447983 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2447984 real results by the end of my first term in office
2447985 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2447986 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2447987 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2447988 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2447989 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2447990 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2447991 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2447992 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2447993 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2447994 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2447995 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2447996 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2447997 the charter will strengthen asean and instil it with a renewed sense of purpose while reaffirming key asean principles and objectives
2447998 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2447999 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2448000 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2448001 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2448002 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2448003 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2448004 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2448005 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2448006 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2448007 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2448008 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2448009 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2448010 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2448011 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2448012 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2448013 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2448014 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2448015 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2448016 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2448017 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2448018 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2448019 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2448020 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2448021 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2448022 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2448023 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2448024 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2448025 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2448026 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2448027 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2448028 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2448029 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2448030 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2448031 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2448032 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2448033 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2448034 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2448035 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2448036 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2448037 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2448038 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2448039 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2448040 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2448041 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2448042 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2448043 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2448044 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2448045 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2448046 hamas movement must rule in gaza and the occupied west bank according to the results of the elections
2448047 the reconciliation is the mechanism of the dialogue but ramallah is not ready for reconciliation now
2448048 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2448049 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2448050 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2448051 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2448052 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2448053 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2448054 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2448055 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2448056 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2448057 seit dreieinhalb stunden haben wir keinen kontakt mehr zu der gruppe
2448058 ich habe ein reines gewissen es w re dumm von mir kurz vor den spielen zu dopen
2448059 die tests wurden in der olympischen zeit die mit der er ffnung des olympischen dorfes beginnt durchgef hrt worden doch sie waren nicht vom ioc beauftragt worden
2448060 f r einen niedrigeren rollwiderstand muss man die energie erhaltung verbessern f r einen k rzeren bremsweg die energievernichtung physikalisch betrachtet ist beides schwer zu vereinen
2448061 wir haben die ergebnisse berpr ft die daten vom adac sind absolut korrekt
2448062 die ergebnisse gelten nur f r eine bestimmte strecke auf anderen strecken kommen andere werte zustande
2448063 bei politischen problemstellungen von nationaler bedeutung eine letztentscheidende steuerungs und f hrungskompetenz gegen ber ihren regionalen parteigliederungen
2448064 erst recht in einer medialen demokratie wie der unseren eine nur zu berechtigte erwartung
2448065 die kurs und grundsatzfrage wie es die spd mit der pds linken und deren lautsprecher oskar lafontaine
2448066 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2448067 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2448068 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2448069 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2448070 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2448071 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2448072 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2448073 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2448074 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2448075 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2448076 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2448077 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2448078 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2448079 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2448080 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2448081 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2448082 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2448083 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2448084 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2448085 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2448086 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2448087 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2448088 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2448089 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2448090 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2448091 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2448092 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2448093 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2448094 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2448095 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2448096 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2448097 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2448098 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2448099 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2448100 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2448101 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2448102 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2448103 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2448104 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2448105 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2448106 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2448107 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2448108 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2448109 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2448110 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2448111 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2448112 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2448113 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2448114 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2448115 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2448116 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2448117 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2448118 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2448119 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2448120 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2448121 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2448122 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2448123 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2448124 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2448125 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2448126 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2448127 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2448128 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2448129 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2448130 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2448131 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2448132 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2448133 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2448134 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2448135 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2448136 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2448137 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2448138 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2448139 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2448140 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project

2448165 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank

2448195 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2448196 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2448197 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2448198 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2448199 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2448200 we have many machine shop customers worldwide who successfully used our le 300 monolec lubricant as a way oil after the introduction of our new duolec additive it was important to use this to develop an un dyed superior performing lubricant as an ideal replacement le 1302 duolec is great for any application calling for an iso 68 amber coloured ep gear or way lubricant
2448201 an answer to a driving problem that costs as many as 160 000 lives in the united states every year
2448202 whats different about ours is that it presents a larger view than many of the others to provide a big clear image of the car or person in your blind spot
2448203 while we have a multi generational catalog we do pride ourselves on coming up with items of special interest to baby boomers and beyond
2448204 we often find there are more constraints on our physical movements like turning the head over the shoulder or rotating the body both of which affect ones ability to deal with blind spots and lane changes drivers who fear they cant rely on their mirrors frequently address the blind spot problem by turning their heads quickly and looking over a shoulder but for some even that limited a rotation can be a painful effort
2448205 you do get a much larger view and youre seeing it with both eyes
2448206 hey guys i got tagged off the break but dont worry i wiped
2448207 this book had a good message about a girl trying to help a baby star i think this a nice theme in the book in that it is about humans interacting with nature the star i liked the cd since i work in a school we are always looking for books that are on tape or cd that can be read to kids that have a difficult time with reading i like that this product came with that it was also a nice visual to have to doll that came with it this provided different ways that the book can be used beyond just reading it to a child
2448208 the most positive characteristics of this book were the illustrations and the colors the book is so vibrant in color that it made you want to read i liked that it came with an audio cd i also liked that the book story had a positive message the nana star plushie was a nice add also to play along with the audio cd
2448209 the positive characteristics of this book is that it was a simple story of a topic children can relate to of being lost or not being able to find see someone they love some of the children talked about not seeing their grandma for long times and they seem to relate to nana
2448210 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over
2448211 the characters in the story were cute and the illustrations were attractive and appealing to my children having the plush to go along with the book made it more fun for the children the story taught a lesson about fear and loneliness something everyone experiences at one time or another
2448212 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over

2448221 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2448223 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2448248 the creation of baggames began on a surf trip to tamarindo costa rica where the evenings were the perfect downtime to play backgammon
2448249 the problem was we didnt bring a game because no one wanted to lug around a full sized board in our already stuffed backpacks we could have brought along a travel version but who really likes playing with those tiny little pieces on a miniature board anyway no one in town had even heard of backgammon much less had one for sale our only option was to conjure up our own makeshift board we found a small sign company to draw up the board per our description and used colones costa rican currency for the checkers

2448274 id just gotten a promotion for more hours and less money and it just didnt add up for me
2448275 i realized i didnt want to be part of a super large organization and needed a job that would enable me to have much more influence over my future
2448276 new zealand has a lot of the same geography as canada and manitoba but they do a much better job of marketing it
2448277 i wondered if it was possible to do this at home and if anyone else had already done it
2448278 i wondered if people even knew we had these great places
2448279 international travellers dont really pay attention to radio or tv
2448280 and so i concentrated on how i used to travel basically through word of mouth from other travellers or people working in hostels
2448281 i had this idea that people were going to come flocking to my door but that wasnt really the case
2448282 i over anticipated how easy it was going to be to create awareness
2448283 i failed to recognize that when youre young and new you need to be a little more reactive in your approach
2448284 i guess its validation that yes i did do something that people are interested in

2448296 precipitous decline in the performance of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2448297 when i retired as chairman allianz was a flourishing vibrant and profitable company with a unique culture that challenged motivated recognized and rewarded employees who worked to make themselves and the company better now
2448298 allianz life is a mere shadow of its former self and may be wounded beyond repair
2448299 a full blown bureaucratic management system has been substituted for an entrepreneurial culture bureaucratic managers have infiltrated the company bringing with them the calcifying taint of the bureaucratic culture
2448300 was that we like many companies are being impacted by the economic slowdown and an acute downturn in financial services
2448301 the problems with allianz life cannot be passed off to others
2448302 but must come to roost at the feet of an ineffective destructive bureaucratic management group and in this regard allianz life unfortunately serves as a wonderful case study for comparing the differences between a bureaucratic and entrepreneurial culture
2448303 if industry leaders and insurance company executives dont show a little more gumption backbone creativity innovation and leadership than they have a history of doing
2448304 sites like rivals com were revolutionary because they brought their readers extremely closer to the college game than anyone had ever been before and its all in one easy reliable place the information just wasnt there before and they took advantage but now the information is as accessible as ever its why everybody knows that matt barkley is a 5 star recruit and that 1 recruit in the country usc blitz revolutionizes the way through which my users can interact with the world of college football
2448305 my site revolves around the idea of interaction with information as opposed to the consumption of information thats the way i see the internet sports world going
2448306 its exciting one day is never the same as the next i love what ive created here because its pure and i feel like this is just the beginning it was created out of my passion for the usc trojans and their football team now its turned into my way of playing for them so i like to give it all i got

2448313 from the bottom of my heart id like to thank united drugs for this award
2448314 this is a huge honor for me as well as for the indian pharmacists association i believe that one person cannot do a good job on his or her own it has to be a team effort my friends at ipa have supported me and helped me out and i could not have done it without them this award is even more prestigious to me because i know that there are other pharmacists who are just as worthy as me
2448315 every day i sit with adjusters and attorneys who are looking for effective ways to explain the concept of medicare set aside arrangements to their clients
2448316 adjusters try to explain to insureds why their settlements are taking so long and what medicare has to do with their claims attorneys try to explain to their clients why after years of litigation they now have to put aside money for their future treatment at times i am recruited to speak directly to clients in spanish about these subjects
2448317 unless you work with a healthy body you cant get results
2448318 i inserted the scalpel directly into the logs neck and opened the chest
2448319 at first there was a terrible scream but the voice soon fell silent
2448320 unless you work with a healthy body you cant get results
2448321 i inserted the scalpel directly into the logs neck and opened the chest
2448322 at first there was a terrible scream but the voice soon fell silent
2448323 i can tell you that we are working with the family and the chinese authorities while we speak
2448324 i got a message from clarko to push forward and just hang around there and see if you can kick a goal
2448325 i did feel the pressure going back more so from the crowd than anything
2448326 i didnt kick it that well but i reckon the crowd pushed that through so it was a perfect way to end whats been a fantastic week and a great day for our club
2448327 we dont like to have that attitude but when youve got a significant margin you can take the chance and push the guy forward
2448328 he had a long way to come from so we were anticipating bradshaw might get a mark late in the game
2448329 sure enough he did but fortunately he missed the goal
2448330 connecting great ideas and great people we look forward to meeting and greeting you
2448331 as a south african company and as a company with a number of south african clients we keep the continuing needs of that nation close to our hearts even from far away london
2448332 we wanted our first company event to represent both our companys values and the values of our clients and in both of those senses the casino night was a great success everyone present was looking forward to future events we have decided that his will be an annual event on mandelas birthday and the nmcf will be our companys official charity organization
2448333 we are very grateful for your support please extend our thanks to all those involved in the event
2448334 nmcf is still a relatively young charity but our work with disadvantaged children is now well grounded in all nine provinces of south africa and we are well aware of the need that still exists we are entirely reliant upon the support of individuals and corporations to ensure that the work continues which is why this donation is so valued by us all
2448335 despite our strong reputation and extensive experience of building homes in spain its understandable that buyers from the uk are exercising more caution than usual in the current market were delighted to be partnering sbe as it means we can offer our customers even more reassurance and confidence when it comes to parting with their hard earned cash
2448336 we researched various companies in spain picked one and bought a home from them off plan we began to worry when nothing seemed to be progressing every time we visited to see how our home was coming along we learned about more problems and we came away very worried about our investment in the end it got to the point where we were so concerned we decided to cut our losses and pull out it worked out for the best in the end as we now own a beautiful taylor woodrow home but this new safe buying scheme would have saved us a lot of time and trouble had it been in place when we first began our search
2448337 we pride ourselves on being a brand that can be trusted and wouldnt lend our name to any company that we werent 100 confident in id like to reassure all of our potential customers that this new scheme can only help reinforce their confidence in spanish property and the whole home buying process
2448338 it is not be possible for developers or recommended partners to buy our accreditation mark
2448339 by gathering together all the necessary legal paperwork upfront and agreeing any necessary changes with our developers we ensure a very quick and safe purchase experience for customers the fact that a household name such as taylor woodrow is ready and willing to put its developments forward for our independent accreditation demonstrates tits commitment to transparency and best practices
2448340 we were a little surprised at the number of people ordering patriotic personal checks
2448341 patriotic checks have always been a great category but now our vote republican checks and vote democrat personal checks have rapidly moved up the list of best sellers
2448342 many people are shocked when they find out they can actually save money and get themed personal checks
2448343 the fact is that we offer nearly a thousand different personal check designs and they are priced at or below the prices banks charge
2448344 the challenge for many networked embedded systems is there is no way to distinguish critical packets from the large volume of non essential ethernet traffic
2448345 ethernet packets are processed on a first come first served basis important packets are left to wait while the packets that arrived ahead of them are processed for embedded systems this leads to systems that are not responsive or worse fail to meet essential deadlines
2448346 previously such sophisticated packet processing was only available in much larger and costlier systems
2448347 quality of service qos standards have been driven by the it industry but have not been broadly adopted in the embedded market due to its complexity and cost the prioritized ethernet framework for the rtxc quadnet tcp ip suite now offers an affordable solution for delivering this capability to embedded systems
2448348 with the michigan economy already on the skids as gas prices went up we saw our prospects dwindle
2448349 we couldnt move the store to another part of the country so we needed to come up with some way to get people back in the showroom
2448350 we tried several other promotions reduced prices on furniture extended payments but nothing seems to work like the free gas
2448351 this is shaping up to be one of our most successful promotions yet for businesses
2448352 every day i have people call me and ask how we can offer such a deal
2448353 weve even had companies that wanted to purchase the certificates to give to their employees to help defray their cost of getting to work
2448354 we wish mr dean a speedy recovery our thoughts and prayers go out to mr dean
2448355 ongoing safety training and facility inspections are a vital component for all facilities housing big cats
2448356 the value of safety training and facility accreditation cannot be underestimated said stockdale adding
2448357 just like skydiving or many other activities in which people engage working with exotic animals especially large cats carries inherent risks strict adherence to appropriate safety protocols is mandatory when proper procedures are used big cats can be handled safely and without incident

2448368 la polemica di mourinho con ranieri di una volgarit unica quando uno si appella allet e a quello che ha vinto il rivale allora significa che non ha argomenti validi
2448369 dopo la prima sfolgorante conferenza stampa non ne ha pi azzeccata una ogni volta che ha aperto bocca lha fatto solo per denigrare non per criticare per offendere e non per controbattere alle idee altrui
2448370 tatticamente non ha niente da dire il suo jurassic football lontano anni luce dal calcio vero
2448371 che poi con il chelsea abbia vinto non significa niente da questo punto di vista considerando che ogni volta che c stato da controbattere un avversario sul piano della tattica e non della bravura dei giocatori ha sempre avuto la peggio benitez gli ha dato autentiche lezioni pur avendo meno campioni e lo stesso numero di calciatori in campo
2448372 se l presa con ancelotti e con ranieri e chi ha letto le sue dichiarazioni con un briciolo di intelligenza non ha potuto esimersi da un sorriso di compatimento
2448373 sa vendersi bene si inventa storie a ripetizione e la societ inter invece che prendere le distanze lo asseconda fino a quando
2448374 ma come mai abramovic lha cacciato il 20 di settembre sicuramente uno dei motivi stato lo scollamento totale che aveva con tutti i giocatori tanto vero che da quando se ne andato il chelsea ha preso a giocare arrivando sepondo in campionato e perdendo la champions perch il capitato terry scivolato nel battere un rigore

2448381 the government is saying it is going to downgrade saving the planet because its priority is helping people struggling to pay their energy bills
2448382 it is absurd to suggest we must choose between the two

2448384 the government should have done this a long time ago

2448389 age certainly wasnt a concern he couldve stayed on the job for several more years but hes been a high profile guy since 1975 and hes 67
2448390 he asked no mention be made of him retiring last season because he didnt want to detract as he put it from the games and the guys involved thats classy
2448391 give him credit for something else too he had nothing but nice things to say about his successor packer wishes clark kellogg well

2448406 many of the worlds biggest banks are proposing reforms that would limit the size and scope of their businesses in one of the most dramatic responses to the credit crisis the proposals would hold down the number of investors who can buy complex financial products bring large swathes of the derivatives markets into regulators sights and call on banks to spend more on technology and risk management
2448407 backed by banks including jpmorgan chase merrill lynch citigroup hsbc lehman brothers and morgan stanley the proposals are being delivered to global regulators in the hope of producing rules for credit markets that would cut risk of contagion and restore confidence
2448408 suggested that big investment houses regularly perform liquidity stress tests to measure their expected flexibility in the face of a crisis it also urged firms to make sure they have accurate snapshots of their exposures to institutional trading partners with the ability to compile detailed reports within hours
2448409 in the current crisis some of the worst failures were in risk monitoring which was before you even got to risk management corrigan a former chief executive of the federal reserve bank of new york said in an interview
2448410 even pension funds and other institutional investors would no longer be automatically allowed to buy bonds backed by assets such as subprime mortgages all but the wealthiest retail investors would be barred from buying structured products such as auction rate securities a 330bn market used by municipalities and student loan providers to raise funds mr corrigan said the markets had been sandbagged by complexity and suggested the new rules would help ensure sophisticated financial products were only sold to investors with the resources and skills to understand and monitor them
2448411 we have filed a complaint with the police here our delegation leader also informed the us homeland security officials and the indian embassy about the four missing students there

2448413 we dont know where these four students went our nasa project was about rockets
2448414 the school is responsible for the missing students i dont know how this happened but from my relatives i have come to know that my son is in california

2448435 lo bueno es que no tendremos presi n porque enfrentaremos al mejor equipo lo malo es que ser un partido dur simo
2448436 somos un equipo nuevo por lo que sta es una excelente oportunidad para ganar experiencia
2448437 es una experiencia maravillosa la que me llevo se dice f cil pero es duro el nivel de aqu es el m s alto del planeta

2448441 to make a woman march with the flag of the islamic republic in beijing is pure heresy and shows total disobedience of the laws mandated by our spiritual guides
2448442 to make this woman march means to openly declare war to our religious values whoever is responsible for this unforgivable act he should know that this gesture constitutes an obstacle for the appearance of mahdi

2448446 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2448447 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth it s like what any other country does
2448448 we cant afford to drain that type of resource from the police department
2448449 we need to come up with something to control the situation normally somebody is in an ambulance and it gets to the hospital without any kind of impediment
2448450 in this particular case it was impeded because of the paparazzi
2448451 everyone thinks theyre going to get the photograph of the century
2448452 it becomes a mob mentality its like a pack of wolves a swarm of bees going after their prey thats the issue that we really need to contend with and we need to come up with a solution
2448453 a total clampdown which i think is what the council is almost proposing would be far too draconian
2448454 it will stop paparazzi but fortunately paparazzi and showbiz go hand in hand they always have done
2448455 i still think theres a great call for good ethical journalism and real journalism without having 30 or 40 large vehicles chasing a 26 year old mother of two along sunset boulevard
2448456 in the end i dont think anything will actually happen
2448457 la has always been a bit like the wild west thats what makes it an exciting place you can come here and almost anythings possible
2448458 theres still that feeling that you can come here and make a million overnight so i think it needs to have that free spirit kind of atmosphere about it

2448502 we hope to get dhruvas mercy not only to combat aids but also to become more moral and devoted
2448503 but this congregational praying is the practical way to counteract the ill effects of the age of kali
2448504 but we neglect the fact that aids itself is a symptom of a greater underlying disease lack of god consciousness

2448520 this great performance was a brilliant distillation of 5 000 years of glorious history
2448521 china will embrace the world with openness self confidence and warmth
2448522 it started with grim paramilitary goons in blue track suits accompanying the olympic torch on its embarrassing tour of democratic countries
2448523 and now the games begin with broken promises on press freedom and shipping in party members to forcibly replace ordinary chinese hoping to see the torch relay
2448524 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2448525 at a time when tibet darfur and chinas broader human rights record are proving delicate issues for beijing organisers the move to present thousands of drilled sobersided army officers was surprising for its brazenness a none too subtle projection of strength
2448526 all of the military arms have have wonderful acrobats and opera troupes we should make use of such resources
2448527 especially before the lighting of the cauldron my heart was pounding so hard there was only one chance and not a single mistake was allowed
2448528 the world wants to see chinese elements so we put our focus on those unique and typical such as the four great inventions chinese calligraphy chinese painted scroll taiji martial arts and others

2448533 het programma onthult informatie die de kijker versteld doet staan in de eerste aflevering testen we bijvoorbeeld openbare toiletten in nederland op hygi ne het resultaat blijkt schrikbarend verder zien we in iedere aflevering hoe iemand zich laat testen op zijn gezondheid dat kan een gewone nederlander zijn maar ook een bner
2448534 ik heb al hele interessante dingen ontdekt die voor de kijker heel interessant zijn we gaan er bijvoorbeeld vanuit dat kinderen geen contactlenzen mogen dragen maar dat blijkt helemaal niet waar te zijn verder volgen we in het programma alle nieuwe ontwikkelingen op de voet zitten er nu meer calorie n in een broodje kroket of een broodje kaas
2448535 a questo traguardo si arrivati solo grazie alla battaglia che lopposizione ha intrapreso e svolto con determinazione contro una maggioranza che ostinatamente e fino allultimo ha cercato di non sganciare un soldo per garantire i servizi di trasporto pubblico nel veneto
2448536 e un risultato importante prosegue il capogruppo del pdsebbene ancora insufficiente
2448537 se la giunta far proprio il documento approvato questoggi allora potremo dire di aver finalmente scritto la parola fine alla fase oggettivamente iniqua dei finanziamenti concessi attraverso il criterio della spesa storica
2448538 un risultato prosegue bottacin per il quale il pd si battuto fin da subito nella convinzione che in ambito sanitario la regione avesse il dovere di rimediare alle evidenti sperequazioni esistenti tra le diverse ulss ora spetta allassessore sandri e alla giunta far tesoro delle indicazioni contenute nel parere prodotto dalla commissione avviando cos quel processo che permetter nellarco di tre anni di arrivare ad una metodologia di riparto dei fondi che si baser su criteri oggettivi e misurabili riferiti esclusivamente al costo medio dei servizi effettivamente erogati
2448539 nella manovra triennale pesante taglio di finanziamenti alle comunita montane
2448540 alla luce di questa riduzione ha dichiarato il senatore maurizio fistarol occorre procedere ad una coraggiosa ridefinizione della struttura e dellorganizzazione delle comunit montane cos come proposto dal partito democratico per farle diventare dei semplici strumenti di supporto ai piccoli comuni di montagna con una drastica riduzione delle spese di funzionamento per poter utilizzare i pochi fondi disponibili ad esclusivo vantaggio delle popolazioni e dei territori di montagna

2448551 it will be a privilege for the university to have the president as its alumni
2448552 we have filed a complaint with the police here our delegation leader also informed the us homeland security officials and the indian embassy about the four missing students there
2448553 if the us police seek our assistance we can help otherwise we can only forward the matter to the ministry concerned
2448554 we dont know where these four students went our nasa project was about rockets
2448555 the school is responsible for the missing students i dont know how this happened but from my relatives i have come to know that my son is in california
2448556 the benefits of investing in collectables as an alternative asset class have never been clearer not only do rare stamps and historical signatures provide a means of diversification and a safe haven in difficult economic conditions but also provide a hedge against inflation
2448557 i was average at academics i cleared my class 10 boards with great difficulty mathematics was especially a sore point so i took up commerce with entrepreneurship in 10 2 got out of school and thought now what
2448558 i used to doodle in the back of notebooks at school watching and drawing cartoons are my hobby so in my second year of pursuing a bachelor of commerce from delhi university when i took up the year and a half long diploma course in 3d animation and visual effects from maya academy of advanced cinematics maac to satisfy my hobby it did not take me long to shift gears to animation completely
2448559 the starting salary for an animator is rs 20 000 25 000 and with the expertise the income only grows
2448560 animation is now full of potential it is becoming the most in demand specialisation in the industry with creativity and determination one can go a long way
2448561 childhood obesity paves way for fitness instructors to join schools five star hotels are also on the lookout for body conditioning and gym instructors freelancing can pay up to rs 1 000 or more an hour
2448562 its not good income for an independent artiste after teaching and a couple of sponsored performances i earn about rs 25 000 a month which just about covers costs but the creative satisfaction is well worth it
2448563 without formulating the domicile policy the government is conducting the teachers examination this way the local people will suffer and outsiders will get jobs in the state
2448564 i believe that all parties now are more inclined to stop the current situation of media throwing at each other because it hurts the people who struggle for freedom and independence
2448565 after all air pollution was a major concern in los angeles 24 years ago
2448566 though few now seem to recall the dramatic scene at the end of the womens marathon when the swiss competitor was seen staggering and stumbling from exhaustion the heat and perhaps the effects of air pollution
2448567 air quality was also an issue for subsequent olympic games in barcelona atlanta seoul and athens
2448568 without doubt beijing is facing a huge challenge there are real and understandable concerns for the health of competitors especially those in endurance and long distance events but the current frenzied focus is marked by considerable amnesia
2448569 for us the olympic games are not the be all and end all they are the means to a larger end
2448570 its not just trees that have been planted its an ecological experiment
2448571 its a whole new green lung for the people of beijing
2448572 beijing is striving to be part of the green team
2448573 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us
2448574 you approve of women when they allow themselves to be dominated and not when they dont its the way you perpetuate a male dominant society
2448575 whats radical about equal pay for equal work and trying to empower women to reach the potential that they have

2448603 it is a change year i think voters are tired of a legislature that continues to fritter away time on too many narrow issues

2448745 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2448768 we are in a situation of self defence against a big and mighty neighbour

2448783 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down

2448787 enraged that these young ladies told him that they were gay and that they were not interested in him
2448788 they fought back they didnt acquiesce they didnt cower if thats a crime then theyre guilty
2448789 they were not crips not bloods not any sort of gang
2448790 one was slightly pretty so i said hi to her
2448791 the no 1 thing she did say was i was never going to make it i remember that crystal clear
2448792 i paid 100 bucks for them so i knew they werent cheap
2448793 the special focus of smart communication inc on the low income segment of the philippines population is a success story that has made it the no 1 wireless carrier in the country
2448794 overall smart has paid close attention to the reality of its filipino market with as much as 90 percent of the population in the d and e income segments many in the philippines are beginning to acknowlegde consumers in the lower income bracket as those who are keeping the countrys retail industry afloat proving true the adage that there is strength in numbers
2448795 not only did smarts approach with telecommunication services to be finally within reach of the majority of the filipinos but their applications have helped to generate real revenues and opportunities for small filipino enterprenuers
2448796 base of the economic pyramic bop market orientation from the start
2448797 smart came to this realization earlier than most filipino business and designed their business model to target these segments from the beginning the result is that smarts bop oriented business model in particular their smart load product has had a real impact on their overall financial success and on the low income customer they serve
2448798 in tennessee authorities say a lesbian gang called gto gays taking over are involved in raping young girls
2448799 and in philadelphia a lesbian gang called dto dykes taking over are allegedly terrorizing people as well
2448800 well you know there is this national underground network if you will bill of women thats lesbians and also some men groups thats actually recruiting kids as young as 10 years old in a lot of the schools in the communities all across the country
2448801 and they actually carry a number of weapons and they commit a number of crimes
2448802 weve actually counted just in the washington d c area alone thats washington d c maryland and virginia well over 150 of these crews and they like i said they recruit these kids to be members of these gangs
2448803 now when they recruit the kids are they indoctrinating them into homosexuality
2448804 as a matter of fact some of the kids have actually reported that they were forced into you know performing sex acts and doing sex acts with some of these people
2448805 it makes sense that if you had lawless gay people they would do this kind of thing you associate homosexuality more with a social movement not a criminal movement but youre saying this is all over the country detective
2448806 i mean you go from new york to california to wherever you want to name you can see these organizations
2448807 now the other thing too that our viewers are going to find very very interesting is the fact that they actually carry some of these groups carry pink pistols
2448808 they call themselves the pink pistol packing group and these are lesbians that actually carry pistols thats 9 millimeter glocks they use these they commit crimes and they cause a lot of hurt to a lot of people
2448809 we have 150 to 175 total gangs in the d c area and out of those only nine where the predominance of members are female
2448810 you simply cant make the jump that they are lesbians i think it is fair to talk about violence and female gangs but to sensationalize or marginalize a community by making a statement like that seems irresponsible
2448811 for some reason or other these organizations dont lay it on the line because they dont know what is going on on the streets
2448812 this is a serious crisis and the so called experts are missing it
2448813 americas most recognized and trusted authority on crime analysis and law enforcement
2448814 we turn to rod wheeler to help us better understand and solve some of these terrible crimes in america
2448815 and the police found out that it was a group of six women who identified themselves as being members of a lesbian gang that actually attacked this young man
2448816 metro officials said the fight was between two gay and lesbian gangs that operate in maryland
2448817 our investigation did not turn up widespread violence in schools due to this
2448818 the sad truth is that sensationalized undocumented fear driven reports about gays and lesbians preying on children are proven to be a ratings winner and the station managers and news producers know that because theyre reporting about gays and lesbians they dont have to be as concerned about backing up their sensationalism with actual facts and figures
2448819 the oreilly segment essentially reported a national epidemic of lesbian gangs preying on young girls without offering up one solid figure or one credible source this type of reporting creates a climate of homophobia and fear and perpetuates dangerous stereotypes of gay people and definitely helps feed into a climate of anti gay discrimination and violence which is a true national epidemic but not one youre likely to see reported with such zeal by bill oreilly
2448820 these lesbian crews these gangs they buy a glock 9 millimeter and you can paint them pink
2448821 a lot of people are confusing these imaginary lesbian gun carrying gangs with our organization
2448822 we would appreciate it if mr oreilly would invite mr wheeler back onto his show to clear up this nonsense in the same arena it started on national tv
2448823 we overstated the extent of gay gangs in the washington area
2448824 they were never identified as being in a gang gang charges were dropped
2448825 they were a pack of lesbians who jumped this guy
2448826 we got three we put our guy wheeler on it im just trying to tell you how we got on this
2448827 we have 150 to 175 total gangs in the d c area and out of those only nine where the predominance of members are female
2448828 you simply cant make the jump that they are lesbians i think it is fair to talk about violence and female gangs but to sensationalize or marginalize a community by making a statement like that seems irresponsible
2448829 there is no evidence whatsoever of a lesbian gang epidemic in this region our membership reports only one lesbian gang
2448830 we have 150 to 175 total gangs in the d c area and out of those only nine where the predominance of members are female
2448831 you simply cant make the jump that they are lesbians i think it is fair to talk about violence and female gangs but to sensationalize or marginalize a community by making a statement like that seems irresponsible
2448832 there is no evidence whatsoever of a lesbian gang epidemic in this region our membership reports only one lesbian gang
2448833 the oreilly factor segment essentially reported a national epidemic of lesbian gangs preying on young girls without offering one solid statistic or credible source
2448834 this type of inaccurate tabloid journalism perpetuates dangerous stereotypes about lesbians and feeds a climate of homophobia anti gay discrimination and violence thats the real national epidemic but not one youre likely to see reported with such zeal by bill oreilly

2448882 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battle field of that war we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth

2448889 emirates is the largest a380 customer by far with 58 on order we were the first airline to commit to the programme in 2001 the a380s capacity range and economics all match perfectly with emiratess business plans
2448890 mubadala has invited lockheed martin boeing and thales to jointly discuss participation in a joint venture company to deliver world class technical services and aircraft sustainment solutions to the uae armed forces and other air forces in the region that are potentially seeking to outsource their maintenance repair and overhaul needs to a world class provider
2448891 the proposed joint venture company will commence by taking over the military mro operations of abu dhabi technologies with the aim of transforming them into a world class operation under the joint management of the consortium
2448892 we are in advanced negotiations with mubadala on the project which could be finalised soon
2448893 mubadala sees a tremendous opportunity in the military aircraft sustainment business specifically when joining forces with the primes to establish a center of excellence of a global stature
2448894 this will be achieved by re structuring and consolidating the existing capabilities currently scattered between the uae air force abu dhabi aircraft technologies and elsewhere in the emirate of abu dhabi and by adhering to the best industry practices while maintaining innovative sustainment solutions

2448902 the uacs goal in this project is to raise awareness because most people have no idea what sharia law is
2448903 we are confident people will see the billboard and learn on their own what sharia law is and come to their own conclusions at the very least we hope our billboard will spark public debate on this overlooked issue
2448904 under sharia law if you are accused of stealing a hand and foot from opposite sides are amputated if you are caught having an affair the woman is stoned to death and the man is given 80 lashes if you change religions you can be charged under apostasy laws and given the death sentence by a legal sharia court if you want to marry a nine year old child sharia law condones pedophilia because mohammad married aisha at six and consummated the marriage at age nine i find these and many more practices of sharia law despicable and hateful
2448905 if a person condones the horrors of sharia law enforcement then living under our u s constitution and bill of rights is not possible

2448958 dentro de la legalidad se est n cerrando todas las puertas
2448959 la respuesta que se est dando por parte de zapatero a la cuesti n de la consulta es desproporcionada unilateral y dif cilmente entendible
2448960 rodr guez zapatero ha tomado la decisi n unilateral y personal de suspender la consulta porque aqu su voluntad es imponer que los vascos no podamos hacer nada que desde madrid no quieren que hagamos ya nos han dicho en m s de una ocasi n que no tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro futuro y ahora nos est n diciendo que no tenemos derecho ni siquiera a opinar
2448961 es lo que estamos defendiendo en las reuniones que estamos manteniendo con el resto de formaciones pol ticas queremos convencerles de que la consulta se tiene que hacer y desgraciadamente a d a de hoy el pnv ya dej sentado que ellos van a acatar la decisi n del tc que es lo mismo que decir que no van a empujar para que la consulta se haga
2448962 paso importante en torno a la cuesti n de la materializaci n del derecho a decidir
2448963 si nos cierran esta v a inventaremos nuevas v as
2448964 es quiz esa falta de unidad o de uniformidad en las opciones de otras formaciones pol ticas las que impiden que proyectos importantes como el de ley de consulta no hayan sido socializados
2448965 es sacar el derecho a decidir del centro del debate pol tico y por eso es tan importante para zapatero que el pr ximo ejecutivo vasco no sea nacionalista
2448966 un candidato teledirigido desde madrid no va a defender los intereses de los vascos
2448967 se va a dedicar m s a las genuflexiones ante zapatero y el gobierno espa ol que a empujar por las necesidades de los vascos
2448968 desde madrid se rechazan sistem ticamente las iniciativas que se aprueban con el respaldo mayoritario del parlamento vasco
2448969 los vascos no se pueden permitir un lehendakari que no cree en el derecho a decidir

2448972 ese pueblo siempre ha acatado y actuado sometido a la legalidad pero tambi n tenemos que ser conscientes de que dentro de esa legalidad se nos han ido cerrando todas las puertas no tenemos margen de evoluci n de desarrollo como pueblo y va siendo hora de abrir un debate estrat gico entre las formaciones pol ticas para dar pasos en otro sentido de superaci n del actual marco jur dico y creo sinceramente que tenemos que colaborar las formaciones pol ticas que somos independentistas

2448986 being a small business it is not easy to compete against internet giants who receive the lions share of traffic from jewelry shoppers
2448987 i was stunned to find out that the gay community is not being courted by internet giants like bluenile com nor by brick and mortar outlets
2448988 the best thing about my job is that i have relationships with the most talented designers in the world so i partnered with constantine who specializes in pure 24 karat gold jewelry we came up with a design that is organic hand made and absolutely exquisite
2448989 even though business is ruff out there we feel we are barking up the right tree on this line
2448990 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2448991 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2448992 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2448993 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2448994 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2448995 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2448996 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2448997 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2448998 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2448999 mr costello said a report by global investment bank goldman sachs which found the impact of the us mortgage crisis could be far greater than thought posed risks to australia
2449000 the report suggests investors may need to cut back lending by us2 trillion
2449001 they are saying that this could lead to a downturn in the worlds largest economy
2449002 this is a very very big risk out in the international economy at the moment
2449003 and believe me australia will not be immune it will take a lot of management to get us through this
2449004 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2449005 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2449006 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2449007 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2449008 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2449009 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2449010 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2449011 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2449012 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2449013 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2449014 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2449015 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2449016 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2449017 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2449018 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2449019 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2449020 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2449021 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2449022 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2449023 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2449024 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2449025 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2449026 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2449027 who are open to doing something on the production side
2449028 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2449029 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2449030 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2449031 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2449032 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2449033 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2449034 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2449035 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2449036 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2449037 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2449038 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2449039 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2449040 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2449041 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2449042 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2449043 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2449044 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2449045 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2449046 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2449047 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2449048 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2449049 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2449050 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2449051 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2449052 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2449053 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2449054 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2449055 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2449056 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2449057 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2449058 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2449059 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2449060 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2449061 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2449062 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2449063 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2449071 rasulullah saw sedang melawat jenazah lalu beliau berkata siapakah diantara kamu yang mau pergi ke madinah maka janganlah ia membiarkan satu berhala pun kecuali dia menghancurkannya tidak satupun kuburan kecuali dia ratakan dengan tanah dan tidak satupun gambar kecuali dia melumurinya

2449077 we have worked tirelessly over the past 18 months to sell the little island plant as a going concern in order that our 180 colleagues would be able to continue working here
2449078 we were initially optimistic that we would find a buyer because there was considerable interest unfortunately that interest has not translated into a sale and one specific company decided to pull out for their own reasons
2449079 these workers face the prospect of seeking employment in a declining jobs market it is a bleak day on the jobs front for cork
2449080 naturally its disappointing but i would be hopeful there will be a time when people who have been made redundant will be facilitated in the new opportunities that have been made available

2449108 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2449109 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2449110 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2449111 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2449112 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2449113 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2449114 we are treating about 90 injured people in tskhinvali hospital the hospital is under constant fire
2449115 this is the staging post for the georgian military heading towards the front this morning we were talking to and filming a number of very fresh faced looking georgian recruits called up as part of president sakashvilis full mobilisation of the military on friday they looked relaxed they looked calm
2449116 but all of sudden the sound of a warplane occurred overhead and a huge explosion not too far away they scattered like flies they didnt know what to do these were not hardened troops by any manner or means
2449117 subsequently there were more explosions around the city cars driving in all directions carrying the injured all sorts of cars mlitary civilan and ambulances
2449118 we are told at this point that the targets of those attacks are military bases outside the city but i am getting reports from witnesses and civilians that villages have also been hit
2449119 russian air forces have bombed towns in georgia the port of poti on the black sea the town of senaki the russian air assault ranges from the black sea coast in the west to the azerbaijani border
2449120 if this is not an all out war what is
2449121 georgia has been attacked by a formidable force it is a brutal attack with the use of air force tanks and even the trademark cyber attack
2449122 peaceful people are dying women children and the elderly the majority of them are citizens of the russian federation in accordance with the constitution and laws of this country i am as the president obliged to defend the lives and dignity of our people where ever they may be
2449123 this is very serious for russia because south ossetians are an ethnic group which is split between russia and georgia and there are many other groups in the region which want russia to protect the south ossetians
2449124 the kremlin is under enormous pressure to begin military operations to protect south ossetian civilians from georgian shelling and as you see the city of tskhinvali was completely devastated as a result of this georgian attack
2449125 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2449126 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2449127 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2449128 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2449129 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2449130 we are actually in the stage of preparing our departure
2449131 we are waiting for the green light from tbilisi to leave iraq today tomorrow or the day after tomorrow
2449132 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2449133 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now

2449135 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2449136 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2449137 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down

2449139 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2449140 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2449141 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2449142 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2449143 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2449144 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2449145 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2449146 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2449147 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2449148 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2449149 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2449150 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2449151 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2449152 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2449153 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2449154 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2449155 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2449156 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
2449157 well if i were president the home morgate crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are
2449158 dont vote for eugene debbs youre throwing your vote away
2449159 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2449160 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2449161 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2449162 when you walk the right handed batter rivero and then you face a batter like sanchez then youre going to have trouble
2449163 got a bad reading of the ball in center field
2449164 have done a nice job for us all year they come in and throw strikes
2449165 if we play well and dont make mistakes we can beat them theyre the best team in the league if we make mistakes theyre going to take advantage
2449166 one game at a time theyre a very good team they swing the bats well and theyve got a pretty good pitching staff so we just have to go out saturday night like we did tonight and play good defense get good pitching
2449167 we are fixing that now i am very hopeful and confident this will be settled soonest
2449168 hundred of rebels have taken up defensive positions due to the fighting
2449169 parents should recognize that having their babies cry it changes the nervous system so theyre overly sensitive to future trauma weve stressed independence so much that its having some very negative side effects parents should feel free to sleep with their infant children to keep their toddlers nearby perhaps on a mattress in the same room and to comfort a baby when it cries there are ways to grow up and be independent without putting babies through this trauma my advice is to keep the kids secure so they can grow up and take some risks
2449170 sometimes i go back and look at myself on film
2449171 even though that highlight might be good i just watch and see what i can do better sometimes i do get surprised to see some of the things i do
2449172 people call me from home and tell me about it
2449173 i dont play video games but it is a privilege to be on the games
2449174 ive been ready since steve left ive been working hard during the summer to get ready to get this chance
2449175 i have to prove myself show up and do the best i can and then well see
2449176 its a team offense its neither one of our backfields
2449177 its a team sport its not about an individual the linemen have to block everybody has to do their thing without them there would be no backfield
2449178 whatever i do to get better this year im going to do harder because im not a big back
2449179 i love to compete and when somebody says i cant do something i like to prove a lot of people wrong i feel like i have a bigger heart i dont feel like i had to be big like others backs
2449180 it makes it hard for the linebackers to see me because im little
2449181 that surprises me because there is always going to be people better but its a privilege and im proud of myself but ive got to move on and show up on the field
2449182 it dont matter what you can do in the weight room it matters what you do on the field
2449183 i think theyre the no 1 offensive line in the country so i think it will be great this year and its exciting already to play
2449184 pat is a great leader it is an honor to be on the field with pat im excited to play with him this year
2449185 i just help them out with the plays make them feel comfortable and just let them know that even though we play the same position that well compete but ill still take the time to help them
2449186 even though i am young and theyre probably the same age but ive been here longer than them ive got to help pat and the others with the offense and step up and be a leader
2449187 im just humble and whatever i do im just doing it for now
2449188 ive got to worry about the present not the future
2449189 playing in the nfl would be a privilege and it would be an honor to make it there but im just worried about now
2449190 all these are are just practices against other teams we didnt come out here with our guns loaded we came up here to see if we could do our base schemes
2449191 weve got to stay with our blocks and run our feet but weve worked hard i dont have any qualms about how hard weve worked
2449192 were looking at everybody to see who we can depend on and who weve got to work with
2449193 great because the kids have to react on the run
2449194 golf is a passion of mine and i truly enjoy playing it
2449195 ive never coached but this is turning out to be a very very exciting thing for me and very rewarding
2449196 abingdon is going to be really tough and graham is going to be solid but we feel like we can be up there with graham and hopefully we can make a region push by the end of the year
2449197 abingdon is the favorite especially after they beat graham on their home course that was a big statement beating them on their home course
2449198 we have a young team ive got a couple of freshmen but most of them are second year players and they are fairly new to the game any way
2449199 it is a developmental year and well try to get better as the year goes on
2449200 i told the team that is my main goal for them is to get back as a team and play for a state championship
2449201 it is going to take a lot of work on their part and my part for the next month or so
2449202 we have some freshmen that are coming up that are going pretty good
2449203 we have a lot of help so we should be all right
2449204 id like to win state last year we didnt really have a chance to make it to state as a team but i only missed making it as an individual by about three shots im hoping to make it to state this year and i think we could as a team
2449205 we have four freshmen that have a lot of talent but they are very young and theyre getting better every day and thats good news
2449206 i certainly think we are going to be competitive but i think we have a little bit of work to do as the season goes on as these young men play more golf the improvement i have seen out of the young ones has been substantial
2449207 theyre all low 70s and mid 80s golfers and weve got a lot of young kids out we feel like we could be one of those teams to get in there so were excited
2449208 id like to make it as an individual to state and i think we have a chance to as a team
2449209 if everybody works hard and plays good we can do it
2449210 their behavior and the way they conduct themselves on the golf course is a credit to graham high school
2449211 they are a bunch of fine young fellas and i like hanging around them they keep me young
2449212 in my clinical practice i am frequently asked by parents what the value of these products is the evidence is mounting that they are of may in fact be harmful given what we now know i believe the onus is on the manufacturers to prove their claims that watching these programs can positively impact childrens cognitive development we dont know for sure that baby dvds and videos are harmful but the best policy is safety first parents should limit their exposure as much as possible
2449213 pediatricians should urge parents to avoid television viewing for children under the age of 2 years although certain television programs may be promoted to this age group research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant care givers eg child care providers for healthy brain growth and the development of appropriate social emotional and cognitive skills therefore exposing such young children to television programs should be discouraged
2449214 unicef who and unfpa estimate that a minimum of 5 per cent of deliveries are likely to require a c section in order to preserve the life and health of mother or infant however rates higher than 15 per cent indicate inappropriate use of the procedure
2449215 i will justify the money tottenham invested in me the first target has to be to threaten the big four
2449216 random facts about my life that i think people will care about

2449219 currently farmers have few options to reduce the contribution that livestock make to greenhouse gas production
2449220 however low emission kangaroo meat will provide an option to avoid emissions and have a positive global impact
2449221 80 km beneath the snake river plain seismic waves travel slower than just about anywhere on earth at this depth
2449222 this is much colder than other presumed mantle plumes such as hawaii
2449223 if it doesnt have clear source as it rises eventually the plume will die out
2449224 regardless of the ultimate origin of the plume the volcanic hazard remains about the same
2449225 i would suspect there is life in the yellowstone hotspot to me ruling out a future catastrophic eruption would be foolish
2449226 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2449227 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2449228 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2449229 because all the musical numbers reflect roxies imagination we had a means to overlap these two worlds we tried to make them as seamless as possible the turn of a head or a lighting cue will take you into this other world roxies imagination is a bit like a dreamscape she provided a unique opportunity to translate the directors vision in a very free way
2449230 the best compliment an editor can receive is that theyre work is invisible
2449231 we are fixing that now i am very hopeful and confident this will be settled soonest
2449232 hundred of rebels have taken up defensive positions due to the fighting
2449233 but we have spoken to the milf and they have assured us they will pull out
2449234 there were a few brief firefights overnight but no reported deaths or injuries
2449235 this is the year weve got to put a number on the board that impresses
2449236 its a show me story and weve yet to perform we know that
2449237 we arent where we want to be but i think we are heading in the right direction
2449238 its just whether we have enough money so i need to make recognizable progress this year

2449242 we did our research on the best way to enjoy the many choices at walt disney world
2449243 but our basic rule is that wherever the kids want to go we go were on vacation so well take it easy and never rush
2449244 keeping up with the kids is a bit challenging because they run faster than grandma
2449245 with the big crowds and potential for headaches down time is really important
2449246 take a long lunch a nap or a swim at noon but break up the day into manageable pieces
2449247 our challenge is to stay together as a group and stay sane
2449248 our plan is to stick together one day and split up the next so we can all have a breather

2449292 there were so many people and my mom starting getting worried
2449293 it was hot and dark and other people were getting nervous
2449294 ambitions in this area go far beyond the possible offers we will be able to make in the end
2449295 its something the pacific nations have been seeking and would be a major inducement for those countries to become part of an integrated economy in the pacific region
2449296 an excellent example of the benefits of regional integration it may help stimulate deeper economic integration through the pacific plan and the pacific agreement on closer economic relations
2449297 if the seasonal labour development plan is a genuine development opportunity then it should not be linked to discussion around free trade agreements

2449299 over the past one and a half days more than 30 000 people have crossed the border
2449300 we havent drawn a conclusion that alcohol and drug use is a serious problem or not a serious problem but any drug or alcohol use is a concern from the safety standpoint
2449301 do i think drugs and alcohol in the industry are a problem
2449302 yes i do and they have been for years but drugs and alcohol didnt have anything to do with the real issue of why my brother was killed
2449303 we welcome senator clinton back to nevada where she ran a spirited campaign against senator obama based on his inexperience and we plan to defeat obama in nevada again on november 4th with the same message that obama is not ready to lead
2449304 has so much more in common with barack obama than john mccain
2449305 i urge you to remember who we were fighting for in my campaign
2449306 i want her to come back but i dont know what chance she has
2449307 i was with her every step of the way but we need to get a democrat in the white house
2449308 you have to accept the reality and do your part anything i dont do ill feel sorry for it later
2449309 shes very intelligent capable and her husband is a great man
2449310 just because were democrats doesnt mean were voting for obama eighteen million people voted for hillary and we havent heard anything from the obama camp
2449311 i dont think its a question of moving over to obama
2449312 i think its a question of voting i want to hear from him something other than talk i want to hear how he will do what he wants to do
2449313 i know were going to see her running for president again
2449314 youre under a lot of pressure when youre trying to figure out your future
2449315 people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy
2449316 were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money
2449317 its just time to play basketball im not a government official or politician ill let them do that
2449318 we are here to concentrate on a gold medal sports and politics just dont match
2449319 we had that discussion and i looked into it and i was right
2449320 its been in the newspaper so i thought the electorate deserved a statement on the matter

2449323 its disappointing that senator mccain is clinging to the failed energy policies of the past
2449324 from the viewpoint of the science the north pole is just another point in the globe but it does have this symbolic meaning
2449325 theres supposed to be ice at the north pole the fact that we may not have any by the end of this summer could be quite a symbolic change
2449326 businesses will succeed based on how well we solve problems like climate change energy independence high health care costs and others
2449327 could this guy lead the country if the president were to die and how much damage could he possibly do as the head of a commission to look into sex and comic book readership among 7th graders
2449328 what do i think about this guy having the ear of the president for the next 4 8 years and working behind the scenes to oh i dont know lock brown people up in a caribbean prison for daring to send a text message about fireworks to someone who lives in eritrea
2449329 what our report shows is that that is not the case

2449332 japanese irish female type is just saying im my normal betsy pain in the assness giving my opinion on where i think the project should go in that spirit id like to add a few more items to dares list while talking about the way those flaws might be packaged
2449333 we cant afford to drain that type of resource from the police department
2449334 we need to come up with something to control the situation normally somebody is in an ambulance and it gets to the hospital without any kind of impediment
2449335 in this particular case it was impeded because of the paparazzi
2449336 everyone thinks theyre going to get the photograph of the century
2449337 it becomes a mob mentality its like a pack of wolves a swarm of bees going after their prey thats the issue that we really need to contend with and we need to come up with a solution
2449338 a total clampdown which i think is what the council is almost proposing would be far too draconian
2449339 it will stop paparazzi but fortunately paparazzi and showbiz go hand in hand they always have done
2449340 i still think theres a great call for good ethical journalism and real journalism without having 30 or 40 large vehicles chasing a 26 year old mother of two along sunset boulevard
2449341 in the end i dont think anything will actually happen
2449342 la has always been a bit like the wild west thats what makes it an exciting place you can come here and almost anythings possible
2449343 theres still that feeling that you can come here and make a million overnight so i think it needs to have that free spirit kind of atmosphere about it
2449344 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2449345 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2449346 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
2449347 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
2449348 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2449349 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds

2449353 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2449354 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2449355 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2449356 breast feeding is associated with resilience against the psychosocial stress linked with parental divorce separation
2449357 theres a lot less verbal communication but lots of tactile communication and eye contact that promotes positive physiological responses
2449358 breast feeding does seem to suppress stress responses in babies and it does seem that theres a protective effect
2449359 in terms of the biological possibility breast milk is pretty amazing stuff and the tactile interaction that goes along with breast feeding does have an influence on the development of neurons
2449360 for most mothers breast feeding doesnt come naturally if the baby doesnt latch on it can lead to feelings of failure and concern about whether or not the baby is getting enough milk women need lots of encouragement and education
2449361 breast feeding is something for mothers and babies to enjoy a time for them to cherish and nurture each other
2449362 this move reflects a real change of opinion a real change in the outlook for the u s economy for crude and for gasoline at the pump as confidence follows these indicators then well see better consumer spending and eventually well see more jobs
2449363 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2449364 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2449365 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything

2449367 in thurston county its a large population and we are the only community health clinic
2449368 here there is a ton of medicaid people but nobody will see them
2449369 we have a quite a few patients that come from yelm and hopefully the lacey clinic will serve some of them
2449370 were just excited to have the opportunity to proceed forward and get this project out of the ground as soon as the market allows us to
2449371 our desire is to start construction as soon as we possibly can but a lot of that is going to depend on kind of the nature of the financial markets
2449372 we feel that having a product of this type located as centrally as this product is located will start bringing in the urban housing
2449373 hanging out at the surface would be a daft strategy for avoiding predators because that is where they can spot your silhouette

2449386 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2449387 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2449388 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2449389 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2449390 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2449391 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2449392 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2449393 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2449394 our priority in this hour is to attend to the needs of the family members the u s olympic mens indoor volleyball team and staff and the entire u s olympic delegation
2449395 in addition the usoc is working closely with the united states embassy united states law enforcement authorities and local law enforcement authorities

2449398 apple pulled the app yesterday without giving my sic any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it
2449399 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end if anyone has a useful contact number for apple please let me know
2449400 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were rich enough to afford this
2449401 its a work of art with no hidden function at all
2449402 they want to get netshare back up but they want to do some technical analysis that they couldnt explain to us
2449403 apple runs the app store so youll have to ask them about the availability of this and other apps
2449404 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capabilities at amp t has a number of other options to choose from
2449405 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all nullrivers dan told wired
2449406 i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it
2449407 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2449408 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down

2449421 unification for the sake of unification is not the path we decided to go down
2449422 in the end what matters most is what consumers are looking for but having too many people on the design phase especially early on would have hurt the project you could have three different user interfaces and a couple of application layers that doesnt make sense
2449423 a lot has happened in the last 12 months to push us in this direction
2449424 from our perspective creating a platform in a mobile space is not like building for the pc with mobile you are fighting for every spare 500 kilobytes you can find we know because we are building handsets right now so instead of adding in compatibility for everything we think it is important to clarify for developers the best possible direction and make it open source so it is available to more people
2449425 to have some type of coalescence is necessary whether the application is a game or interacting with the cloud

2449610 we addressed our issues to the chairperson of council but we have not received any communication from him instead we are just reading in newspapers that the university will be opening as planned muasas position still remains even if they open lecturers will not teach
2449611 whereas the universities and other tertiary institutions act 2001 section 68 1 provides for the establishment of academic staff associations the law does not bestow on them immunities of a registered organisation as stipulated by section 24 of the labour union act no7 2006
2449612 this letter is to draw your attention to the fact that the associations have no mandate to call for industrial action that would be illegal the leaders of academic associations should be accordingly advised to comply with the laws of the land
2449613 article 29 1 of the constitution assures all ugandans of the freedom of association which shall include the freedom to form and join associations or unions including trade unions political and other civic organisation no person can be forced to join or belong to an association or union thus the choice to unionise or not lies wholly with academic staff members who will make such a decision without coercion or undue pressure from management
2449614 we would like to emphasize that muasas right of association and academic freedom cannot be overridden by the state less so council
2449615 am not muasa and please dont ask me about muasa

2449619 they have never asked to see me before i am happy i have seen them i will give them an audience
2449620 this is unacceptable and executive budget should be cut to restore sanity in service delivery to our people
2449621 we therefore recommend that measures be instituted in the budgetary process to reduce these imbalances and weakness in budgetary allocations
2449622 there are no funds to facilitate the judiciary to fight the backlog of cases yet many prisons across the country are over congested
2449623 the executive is the implementers of government programmes and if we are giving this arm more resources this is specifically for implementation to ease service delivery
2449624 if this money can reach the beneficiaries there would no complaints
2449625 for parliament and judiciary we can talk about it in fact as the budget committee we have already recommended that judiciary budget be increased to at least 5 per cent of the national budget and parliament should get 2 per cent to streamline service delivery
2449626 parliament cannot play its roles because of financial constraints and this has promoted corruption in the country because there is no enough monitoring of government activities
2449627 we can mourn the whole day and night but we cannot create resources which we dont have
2449628 our resource envelope is small and if you dont agree with the government plan to create employment then we can discuss to amend the order of priorities
2449629 fha mortgage applications are up since the loan limit was increased and more people became eligible

2449691 i was surprised by a couple of things in the report
2449692 we were doing a good job but a couple of procedures needed to be reviewed
2449693 we did not know there was such a variance in size
2449694 they gave us shackles so old and damaged we had to call a meeting because we couldnt use them
2449695 there should be no question that lubrication is critical to a proper assembly
2449696 there should be a more stringent examination of the rope connection at the counterweight

2449702 the larger than expected rise is not a complete shock
2449703 this cannot go on much longer it will fall apart on its own
2449704 to the extent that its different at all makes it difficult to sell
2449705 people all over the world are watching this thing you start putting this all together and it gets very complex and complicated
2449706 were not going to leave a bridge open if its unsafe
2449707 theres no money wasted even if the contract is never signed
2449708 it turned out to be that somebody must have sent in a bill while eating dinner
2449709 somebody saw that and thought it could possibly be anthrax
2449710 why would they do that to her i still cant understand
2449711 every time i pass her apartment i think about it
2449712 i look in the windows and i expect her to be there its really sad to live that long and then to have your life snuffed out for no reason
2449713 i think someone knew she was a target and someone knew she was in there by herself
2449714 i wish today i knew who done that because when i wake up in the morning i expect to sit out and talk with her
2449715 they actually tried to pin something on me but i told them i aint good for none of that
2449716 this alleged misconduct is reprehensible and cannot and will not be tolerated
2449717 today i call on my fellow republican leaders to join me in calling for rep muschanys immediate resignation from the missouri house
2449718 i am extremely disappointed with what i have learned regarding this
2449719 if there is a shred of truth to these allegations then he should resign immediately
2449720 its important to remember that these are allegations scott muschany is presumed innocent
2449721 its unfair for people who know nothing about the evidence to make judgments on these allegations
2449722 i am shocked about the muschany story and feel very sad for each of the families affected
2449723 if the cole county grand jury allegations are true muschany should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of missouri law
2449724 cant comment on his case because he lives in our jurisdiction

2449739 there is little if any difference among major league pitchers in their ability to prevent hits on balls hit in the field of play
2449740 we have essentially removed the home park and defensive influences from the correlations
2449741 what the hell does that even mean arent you saying the same thing which just some qualifiers
2449742 the support neutral name comes from the fact that baseball prospectus is removing or neutralizing the variability of different levels of run support and bull pen support this gives a truer sense of how well a pitcher performed without the distortions of offensive and defensive support
2449743 well if person a did this and if person b did that and if person c didnt do that the family could be a lot more cohesive

2449749 maybe mclane lacks patience maybe he still thinks theres a quick fix out there that might be why hes willing to spend 100 million on carlos lee and veto 1 2 million in spending on three draft picks if hes really smart hell realize he could save money by splurging on draft picks and cutting corners on wolf shawn chacon etc when he finally understands this when he studies how the twins and marlins and as have succeeded on dramatically smaller budgets hell understand that less might actually be more

2449760 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
2449761 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2449762 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans

2449800 i think the west ham fans pride themselves on the atmosphere and the way they support the club
2449801 but they dont realise what a difference it makes and what it does to the opposition when theyre singing bubbles when we come out for the handshakes
2449802 when we played bolton everton and middlesbrough the season before last i invited some people who werent west ham fans and they couldnt believe it
2449803 i think we had that galvanised feeling that theres a bit of a cause what we want and need is that from the first game to get behind everybody
2449804 last year we ended up fielding an xi that werent comfortable and were playing out of position
2449805 youve also got to consider the fact that there are three points to be won and if you get it horribly wrong and you start to get thumpings that isnt any good either
2449806 i didnt send anyone out there with the intention of being negative at all we knew we were safe and if we could put a few games together we could get in the top eight
2449807 i was hoping for a long time that we were going to get one or two of the boys back and make a push because i looked at the run in and thought if we keep ourselves in and around there we could have done even better
2449808 the nature of the premier league is if you can turn three draws into wins its another six points and its a dramatic difference
2449809 it could mean fifth bottom to mid table mid table to just outside europe thats how tight it is
2449810 i knew it was all still to play for but we were getting hit all over the place with problems so i did see it as a missed chance

2449812 killed himself by jumping from the second story of the drum tower
2449813 aware of the reports of the accidents suffered by two american citizens we are working with the chinese authorities to find out more on the cause of the incident
2449814 i wouldnt say its an easy job it can only get worse if you look at it that way
2449815 ive had more good days than bad days so far in my career i just have to keep enjoying myself and trying to improve but its no surprise that i keep improving because i wake up every single morning trying to get better
2449816 i didnt think so because before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work i normally do
2449817 i just had to spend the extra time with the other players to build the confidence which kept me a little bit longer at training
2449818 but in terms of batting you just have to go out and bat you cant be a captain when youre batting you just have to go out to score as many runs as you can
2449819 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can i built an innings played straight played in my areas played a few shots which were funky i suppose but just got on with it
2449820 it does mean more because of the scrutiny but in terms of me and how ive been playing i have been getting hundreds and scoring runs
2449821 in terms of my relationship with the players i have to keep growing that that has come on leaps and bounds in the four days i have been in charge
2449822 im getting to learn a lot more about how the guys operate and you have a really different perspective you really want them to do well for them for you the team its really a holistic thing
2449823 if we can pass england without any more damage then we can say we are still in the game

2449840 many patients whose body parts and organs had to be removed told us that they were hit by missile like shells the velocity of the shells is such that they not only pierce through body parts but damage tissues and veins it seems they have been hit by rudra

2449844 if you dont send edward out emmett still invisible in the night hissed menacingly were coming in after him
2449845 jasper what do vampires do for bachelor parties youre not taking him to a strip club are you dont tell her anything emmett growled from below there was another thud and edward laughed quietly
2449846 youre monopolizing the bride emmett said coming up behind edwards shoulder
2449847 dont be afraid i murmured we belong together i was abruptly overwhelmed by the truth of my own words this moment was so perfect so right there was no way to doubt it his arms wrapped around me holding me against him summer and winter it felt like every nerve ending in my body was a live wire forever he agreed and then pulled us gently into the deep water
2449848 if i dont have a better sense of equilibrium in my next life im demanding a refund
2449849 will we move back into the white room now i wondered idly
2449850 i think it might be safer if its premeditated rather than if i wait for you to assault me again
2449851 did you want to go survey the demolition zone now
2449852 there isnt much you wouldnt do for me either is there
2449853 i almost went back i almost turned around and fell down on my knees and started begging again but i knew that i had to quit bella quit her cold turkey before she killed me like she was going to kill him
2449854 it goes against the grain he explained letting you wrestle with lions
2449855 we could go back he said solemnly but there was a teasing light in his eye
2449856 he got close enough that i could feel the heat of his body in the air between us my throat burned in response
2449857 did a get in a couple of good swipes emmett asked eagerly
2449858 and here youre probably the one person who could take him
2449859 what no magic visions no formidable offensive abilities like oh shooting lighting bolts from my eyes or something nothing helpful or cool at all
2449860 she understands youll be careful wont you renesmee youll help us renesmee touched him again no i dont care if you bite jacob thats fine jacob chuckled
2449861 i took a deep breath emmett how do you feel about a little bet
2449862 i squared my shoulders you me arm wrestling dining room table now emmetts grin stretched across his face
2449863 jacob had his hand in front of his face pretending to shield his eyes from the glare freaky bella he commented
2449864 studpid leeches he muttered to himself when we go outside think theyre so superior he snorted
2449865 it was not her job to fight but to protect there was no bloodlust in her raw as i was i knew that if this were between her and me i would obliterate her
2449866 edwards and jacobs faces were almost identical masks of horror despite the fact that one of them was an animal
2449867 edward leaned his head against the same shoulder where hed placed renesmee goodbye jacob my brother my son
2449868 chelsea is trying to break our bindings edward whispered but she cant find them she cant feel us here his eyes cut to me are you doing that
2449869 his face glowed with an expression of triumph that i didnt understand it was the expression an angel of destruction might wear while the world burned beautiful and terrifying
2449870 i couldnt speak anymore i lifted my head and kissed him with a passion that might possibly set the forest of fire
2449871 hard to feel confident when youre surrounded by horse sized wolves emmett laughed poking jacobs arm
2449872 but i didnt have any choice the only other option was to have the surgery or stop playing for 10 weeks and see what happens
2449873 i had to keep going back to spain and for five or six months i dont think i trained for a week completely
2449874 it all affected by fitness and my confidence levels i played a lot of games we did a comparison with other players who had suffered my injury and they didnt play 20 of the amount of games i ended up playing in
2449875 it just makes all the more determined to do well this season id never had surgery before in my life i dont want to have that any more now im really hungry now to have my best season at everton
2449876 we all like joao moutinho and want him to stay at the alvalade
2449877 at the end of last season i was promised me that if there was a good offer i could leave
2449878 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than eight million euros
2449879 i want to leave rennes everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters
2449880 i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it
2449881 i consider fear and loathing in las vegas to be comfort reading i like the al pastor tacos at tacos mexico and i count among my literary influences the chainsaw from doom
2449882 i did feel the love show me the love they did they showed me the love
2449883 its really important to the guys in the shop the guys on the team that put so much effort into it
2449884 i think a lot of them were nervous they werent sure what was going on because there were so many rumors flying around and there was always something being said about dei and about their future not being good and not being bright and this and that
2449885 at the end of the day those guys have to go home to their families and think about that stuff as bad as it might sound it feels good for them the guys are really pumped up in the shop we had a big meeting at the shop and i told them all and there was a big cheer everybody was happy and that made me feel good they put a lot into it and im glad to see that they were happy about it
2449886 martin has moved into a leadership role in our company very seamlessly and has stepped into that and accelerated it
2449887 he has been a big part of a lot of direction weve taken in the competition area he and i had a conversation last week and i said it was critical to get feedback from him the best feedback we can get from anyone in the company is from someone sitting behind the wheel and driving that car
2449888 so he is a very important part of our team hes a huge leader with all four of our drivers were really excited about him being there its amazing how granular martin gets with the details of what we need to do to accelerate our program to the next level
2449889 without the penalty wed have a really good shot i think
2449890 whos to say whatever things happen it hurt but i can think of 250 points right now that we gave away pretty easily early in the season you cant really blame it on that at the end of the day we didnt the job done that we needed to and thats what were working on
2449891 it wasnt so much the two companies blending i think as it was we brought in some new technology weve got some new things and we still havent figured out exactly how to apply them to when we show up on friday and into the race car
2449892 i think now that this is over we can look at bringing in some more people and bringing in some new people that can help keep things organized help us try to relate that information from the shop to the racetrack a little bit better and make some gains there
2449893 i was happy for martin and dei because he can see next year what the landscapes like
2449894 he remains the premier driver for that whole company i think martin made the right decision to wait it out for another year
