7960001 no facis enfadar ton pare nena si jo tentenc per no el facis enfadar dona
7960002 and since even the jews feelings are limited to the purely material realm his thoughts and ambitions are bound to be so even more strongly
7960003 i say that boy is bout as sharp as a bowlin ball
7960004 there is always fear of something like this but with these raids we know now its real
7960005 these raids have really highlighted the difficulties towns face in this situation
7960006 im not sure all of these towns have an ability to cope and provide the crisis intervention
7960007 its a different community than when i was growing up for sure
7960008 we have zero tolerance for employing people who are not authorized to work in the u s and use all available tools provided by the u s government to verify the documents of the people we hire
7960009 you can see that people are more scared in general
7960010 some of them they dont even tell you directly but people dont go outside like they used to and things like that
7960011 it would be a huge hit to our community culturally economically our businesses our people a huge hit
7960012 i do not accept publicity would make it impossible for him to be a police officer even though acquitted
7960013 shutting up about his allegations of wrong doing against simunovich fisheries
7960014 i demand that either the member gives me the evidence now or he apologises what he is saying is baseless and more important it is the subject of a serious defamation case for which at the time all the way through december last year tvnz and radio new zealand argued that they had never at any point sought to impugn my integrity the member is now seeking to litigate a sub judice matter in the house
7960015 its an absolute disgrace madam speaker that you shut down an mp asking questions an absolute outrage
7960016 i had heard that the kiwi team had appealed to the ioc to strike another medal but i wasnt really expecting anything to come of it
7960017 apparently theyve done it in the past with the british team
7960018 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
7960019 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
7960020 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
7960021 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
7960022 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7960023 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
7960024 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed
7960025 gu rdenlo bien porque no volveremos a publicar sobre el tema en buen rato
7960026 were not doing the parade for the shopkeepers were doing it for the public
7960027 it was a hard game not many teams will go to york and get a result
7960028 id say york are the best side we have played so far
7960029 it was just a battle more than anything there were no easy chances and luckily we managed to get a good point out of it
7960030 in the welsh league there are only a couple of teams who are full time there are more full time teams in this league and the pace is faster local amp nations
7960031 its this newfangled contraption thats going to take over the world we can communicate with each other
7960032 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7960033 give wife compliment or she will yell at me at home also dont mention the bill i want to pass about revoking womens rights to vote
7960034 i think my wife looked radiantly stunning like a 1906 sunset off the shores of lum thao phong when we were having cream cheese sandwiches
7960035 i have said repeatedly i think the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
7960036 i think that the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision that under narrow limited well defined circumstances the death penalty is at least potentially applicable that does not violate our constitution
7960037 youre as likely to get murdered on the streets of sacramento as the streets of l a that doesnt sit well with people
7960038 im not saying we dont have problems but i dont think its the job of the mayor to make people feel unsafe in their city
7960039 i want people to feel good about where they live
7960040 i was out talking to people in the community and that was their top concern
7960041 it was an issue that came up over and over and over again

7960049 not so much new just a little transparency here and there flash tag cloud and fancy zoom
7960050 chaotic and unstructured nature of current method in the field
7960051 madness in the method the acts of the apostles in current study
7960052 criminal justice system sent 13 innocent people to death row

7960054 about 50 percent as a matter of principle are choosing to plead not guilty and their cases are being set over to next week
7960055 the length of time it took to be seen in court is a subject of complaints

7960057 non ho mai detto che gli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola italiana chi riporta il mio pensiero in questo modo in grave malafede e vuole creare una polemica che chi conosce il mio pensiero sa che non ha fondamento
7960058 ho sempre ritenuto che esistono bravi professori sia al nord che al sud ma
7960059 mi sono limitata a segnalare che la scuola nelle regioni meridionali colpita da una grave crisi sfido chiunque a sostenere il contrario
7960060 non si pu far finta di nulla non si pu non porre il problema quando tutte le classifiche nazionali e internazionali ocse pisa segnalano questa grave arretratezza
7960061 colmare il gap esistente tra scuole del nord e scuole del sud con pi formazione e aiuti sia per i docenti che per gli studenti
7960062 vogliamo chiarire al ministro rileva la rete degli studenti i significati dei dati ocse pisa citati litalia ultima in europa per la qualit della scuola probabilmente ci dipende anche dal fatto che siamo pressoch ultimi per quantit di finanziamenti attribuiti al settore
7960063 spero davvero che il ministro si riferisse alle condizioni di arretratezza delledilizia scolastica del sud perch la preparazione degli insegnanti di primissimo livello
7960064 prendiamo atto della smentita del ministro gelmini sui corsi intensivi per gli insegnanti del sud ma ora ci dica come intende affrontare i problemi veri della scuola
7960065 e assai grave afferma lombardo che ci si esprima in questi termini razzisti parlando di uomini e donne del sud non necessario scomodare la storia o la letteratura per trovare tra i meridionali figure di straordinario rigore etico ed enorme valore morale e intellettuale
7960066 al di l delle smentite parlano i fatti i tagli apportati in finanziaria fanno presagire il peggio
7960067 oggi pi che mai aggiunge pina picierno responsabile delle politiche giovanili abbiamo la conferma che per questa maggioranza per questo governo litalia non pi una nazione unita ha vinto bossi e gli altri si adeguano
7960068 any contribution to this discussion should begin with the recognition that it stands in danger of the unforgivable exegetical sin the sin of attempting to make a passage mean something other than the meaning intended by the author and conveyed by the words the exegete may say i disagree with these words i dissociate myself from them i wish they had not been written but he may not twist or conceal their meaning
7960069 because in short of its orientation toward exposition rather than explanation that the academic field of biblical criticism as it is encountered even today is often radically different from and adopts procedures alien to many other types of religious studies
7960070 it was the assumption that the only valid scholarship answered the narrowest historical questions did it really happen did he really say it and if so what kind of history can we make of it all meaning what can we say about what was really said and done
7960071 religious and moral traditions are essential to human well being and are in constant need of both development and criticism
7960072 a parting of the ways scholarly identities and a peculiar species of ancient mediterranean religion
7960073 there may be coarse hypocrites who consciously affect beliefs and emotions for the sake of gulling the world but bulstrode was not one of them he was simply a man whose desires had been stronger than his theoretic beliefs and who had gradually explained the gratification of his desires into satisfactory agreement with those beliefs if this be hypocrisy it is a process which shows itself occasionally in us all to whatever confession we belong
7960074 there is no general doctrine which is not capable of eating out our morality if unchecked by the deep seated habit of direct fellow feeling with individual fellow men
7960075 for the egoism which enters into our theories does not affect their sincerity rather the more our egoism is satisfied the more robust is our belief
7960076 no matter how well you teach you could always do it better or devote more time and energy to it it will suck you dry you have to establish over time how much time you can give it do a decent job with it but save time for yourself
7960077 it will get easier and one lesson you need to learn as early as you can is this make it fun make it fun for you as well as for them
7960078 finally for now the most important thing i can tell you is that your life has begun its not in the future you have been taught over and over that if you work hard now life will be good later on when you can relax not so life right now is it and if you arent enjoying parts of it change those things that are bothering you and make them enjoyable
7960079 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice

7960082 never settling for easy modern applications based on thin biblical analysis the authors wrestle seriously with the book of acts as living scripture for todays church and a prime resource for ecclesial renewal
7960083 permit me to dream for a moment how about a teen challenge program of memorization of scripture in the original languages going into the program inductees would have to have a firm grasp of the languages already and a commitment to detox from a culture that tells them its normal to know dialogue from their favorite tv shows and song from their favorite songstresses by heart but not psalm 23 in hebrew and 1 corinthians 13 in greek even if they studied the requisite languages for years coming off the program graduates would be able to pick up their original language bibles and sight read a core of important passages with ease and pleasure a foundation on which to build
7960084 illegal aliens often times falsely represent their place of birth
7960085 it is the sense of the congress that the focus of negotiations for such agreements should be a to expedite the transfer of aliens unlawfully in the united states who are or who are about to be incarcerated in united states prisons
7960086 to the extent of available appropriations funds otherwise made available under this section with respect to a state or political subdivision including a municipality for incarceration of an undocumented criminal alien may at the discretion of the recipient of the funds be used for the costs of imprisonment of such alien in a state local or municipal prison or jail
7960087 of the 130 000 000 appropriated in fiscal year 1995 for the state criminal alien assistance program the department of justice disbursed the first 43 000 000 to states on october 6 1994 32 days before the 1994 general election and then failed to disburse the remaining 87 000 000 until january 31 1996 123 days after the end of fiscal year 1995
7960088 removal proceedings under section 240 of the immigration and nationality act
7960089 order of conditional transfer to i n s detainer with detainer
7960090 informed by the united states department of justice immigration and naturalization service that the subject of this order is an alien subject to deportation and the board finds the welfare of the citizens of georgia and the orderly administration of this states penitentiary resources would be best served by an action allowing the subject of this order to depart georgia custody for the sole and limited purpose of enabling such actual deportation action to occur
7960091 failing actual deportation the subject of this order shall be returned to georgia custody to resume service of all sentences without credit for the time lapsing while out of georgia custody
7960092 if the parole board in georgia makes a decision to grant parole they dont make it earlier than what it would be if they do not have an ice detainer
7960093 just because they have an ice detainer does not mean we will consider them for parole on condition of deportation
7960094 recent data suggest s that the canadian gross domestic product growth in the second quarter was likely somewhat weaker than expected
7960095 the bottom line is that this speech is consistent with our view that the bank of canada will pass on rate changes next week but is turning somewhat more dovish in a manner that could pave the way for further easing
7960096 we are forecasting a 50 basis point decline in short term interest rates in the fourth quarter of this year
7960097 her name wasnt even mentioned at our breakfast meeting this morning and half the people in the room were clinton delegates
7960098 apparently weve moved past racism in america but we havent moved past sexism
7960099 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7960100 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention
7960101 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7960102 by rule as a delegate i must support the nominee im going to follow the rule
7960103 i wont get to cast my vote my state wont reflect what the vote was that would be very unfortunate if you are going to disenfranchise half of the people at the convention its going to be very hard to find unity
7960104 the largest portion of it is media spin and groups that have no association with her campaign
7960105 theyre groups that are more into making a statement about themselves rather than about the democratic party or senator clinton
7960106 were going to see a rousing speech from her she can give such a great speech its going to bring the convention together and its going to be a united convention
7960107 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7960108 unfortunately they were ignored also by nato and the un
7960109 contradicts the principle of territorial integrity a principle based on the international law of nations

7960113 all my life i have been waiting for this moment our people have been waiting for 18 years
7960114 what was most pleasing was the fact that provisions for credit losses were quite manageable
7960115 with relative performance in banks having become much more critical in the past year however we continue to believe that bank of nova scotia is likely to be one of the top performers
7960116 the one recurring knock against bank of nova scotia is the level of securities gains it generates from its investment portfolio
7960117 they helped again this quarter and along with the significant trading revenues generated in the quarter could lead some naysayers to question the overall quality of scotias earnings
7960118 one of the ideas behind too human is we want people to start thinking about technology generally technology is misunderstood and always presented as this positive force
7960119 it can be very positive but it can also be very negative
7960120 i think thats something that naturally gravitates to online and we obviously throw them some bones to latch on to
7960121 the online community fixates on something and they piranha feed on it
7960122 weve been working on too human in earnest in full production since we finished metal gear solid the twin snakes in 2004 anything before that you might as well not think about it i dont know how we can communicate that any clearer its not this big epic thing people make it out to be its more dramatic so people like to see it that way but its not reality i wish people would focus more on the final product than the actual process
7960123 i was trying to point out the futility of judging interactive media from non interactive sources like screenshots or video
7960124 that was really unfortunate but we couldnt get away from it
7960125 denis likes to stay interactive with the community and this is one of the ups and downs that go along with it
7960126 at the end of the day the whole idea of
7960127 boasting a glossy black surface emblazoned with a colorful motif inspired by extreme sports and graffiti art this model emanates power daring and energy with its playfulness and musky scent
7960128 in glorious pink this design evokes the imagery of a summer party leaving the somber feel of conventional laptop designs far behind with its cheerful floral motif and a floral scent the most attractive laptop for ladies
7960129 realized in a pastel green hue this graphic motif is inspired by the love and respect for nature return to the embrace of mother nature for a crisp and refreshing awakening of the senses whenever you work on your notebook
7960130 the freedom afforded by a boundless expanse of sky and the energy of breaking waves are captured perfectly on the cover of this notebook the matching invigorating aquatic scent will keep your days energized

7960137 if there was a subsequent series of cheques paid some substantial time later despite the fact that there was as inquiry in this house that concerned a business those cheques were never cashed
7960138 in the first case before the immigration court i was able to prove citizenship and the judge terminated the process immediately a few months later they arrested him again and charged him with the same thing i am working now to prove citizenship once again although it is the same judge and same evidence moreover there is an order in his file evidencing such it is outrageous
7960139 to our surprise on or about may 12 2008 i received a notice of hearing for may 19 2008 i immediately filed for termination based upon the prior order terminating the matter to date i have been going back and forth to try and speak with the assistant chief counsel for the department of homeland security to see if they will take judicial notice of the prior order of termination but they have not returned our calls the immigration court has not ruled on my motion to terminate as of today it is now june and i believe he has been in detention since may but i am not sure efforts to speak with him have been very difficult
7960140 construction on sdc began in 1999 it was halted in 2000 resumed in 2005 and was completed in september 2006 in response to demand for prison and detainee beds the opening of the facility is indicative of ccas strength and growth in its industry

7960148 frederick county sheriff jenkins is destroying families and the economy
7960149 theres no one in that detention center who hasnt broken the law
7960150 it is incredibly difficult to find someone once they have been detained family members lawyers and friends will now be able to use this map to locate their loved ones it will also be a critical resource for advocates and provide a strong visual tool to educate the u s public and policy makers about this hidden system
7960151 it is heartbreaking to see families struggle to find a loved one in detention frantic to learn which detention centers are nearby and it is challenging to advocate for detention reform and hold the government accountable for its capricious policies without a clear understanding of the vast system in place and its proposed expansion
7960152 d eportation procedures were made to order for wholesale violations of basic human rights mass raids and arrests were conducted without benefit of warrants individuals were often held incommunicado and not allowed to see anyone without the opportunity to post bail deportees languised in jail until the next deportation train
7960153 the apprehension and examination of supposed aliens are often characterized by methods which are unconstitutional tyrannic and oppressive
7960154 i left a lot of messages becasue we wanted to find out i called immigration in arizona in october they told me they had no record of saldivar i called back to san francisco nobody had no answer but somebody had to have some record

7960158 ive seen the rise of hatred towards our ethnic group we see it happens with the germans to the jews with other people when the economy goes bad you got to blame somebody theres the feeling that this ethnic group is causing a lot of problems
7960159 the new memorandum would allow the killing of bin laden the administrations position was that under the law of armed conflict killing a person who posed an imminent threat to the united states would be an act of self defense not assassination on christmas eve 1998 bin laden sic sent a final draft to president clinton with an explanatory memo the president approved the document because the white house considered this operation highly sensitive only a tiny number of people knew about this memorandum of notification a message from tenet to cia field agents directed them to communicate to the tribals the instructions authorized by the president of the united states that preferred that bin laden and his lieutenants be captured but if successful capture operation was not feasible the tribals were permitted to kill them
7960160 when they have on the first page that on may 13 he ruled that the respondent had acquired us citizenship at birth thats a wrong date in my mind its obfuscation we need to get to the bottom of it now
7960161 move full force to see what the department of corrections is going to do to honor the termination order
7960162 had not written that letter he would have been deported
7960163 we had no idea about what he was talking about
7960164 he doesnt understand why hes still there because he was supposed to be paroled in february 2006

7960166 registered at this office as a citizen of the united states having acquired united states citizenship by birth under section 301 g ina 1952
7960167 you can prove he is lying because he didnt want to take my fingerprints or even a picture thanks to this hold i had to do seven years of my sentence at a high security level prison because of the hold i had from immigration
7960168 if immigration contacts us and says theyre a citizen immigration has to tell us
7960169 we just have to wait until the outcome we dont say this persons wrong or right we just wait until the final outcome
7960170 a fulton county superior court judge recently signed an order ruling that the parole boards 90 policy adopted in 1997 was implemented improperly and as a result is ineffective and has no force or effect after consulting with the office of the attorney general the board has decided not to appeal the decision and to apply the ruling to all cases previously considered using the 90 policy
7960171 one day i tell them this does not depend on what officer i get but what the law is no matter who i talk to i should get the same answer
7960172 we said no you dont resign youve already been in there 9 years just one more year
7960173 this scant unauthenticated evidence cannot serve as a basis for the determination of respondents citizenship
7960174 during the course of his removal proceedings dhs counsels obligation to see that the law was observed was not fulfilled counsel for the government has an interest only the law being observed not in victory or defeat in any particular litigation see reid v ins 949 f 2d 287 9th cir 1991 see also freeport mcmoran oil and gas co v f e r c citing the aba code of professional responsibility holding government lawyers to a higher standard than private lawyers and finding it astonishing that an attorney for a federal administrative agency could so unblushingly deny that a government lawyer has obligations that might sometimes trump the desire to pound an applicant into submission freeport mcmoran oil and gas co v f e r c 962 f 2d 45 48 d c cir 1992 in the instant case the truth of the matter is that the government wins when justice is done matter of s m j 21 i amp n dec 722 727 bia 1997 however here the respondent who should have been aided in obtaining any procedural rights or benefits required by the statute regulation or a controlling court decision was left to linger in the procedural quagmire of dhs
7960175 there was no way you could leave you were definitely detained
7960176 none of us were in handcuffs but there was no way you could say im leaving
7960177 none of the white folks in the office that i know of were asked for proof of citizenship to be asked for proof of citizenship in this country its an insult this is the united states of america this country does not require that
7960178 were hoping the prospect of thousands of u s citizens over time filing claims for damages against the united states government might cause ice to reconsider how these raids are conducted
7960179 you cannot in this country engage in group detentions of large numbers of people because you think a smaller number within the larger group has done something wrong
7960180 created a powerful atmosphere of fear and intimidation people felt like they had been taken hostage
7960181 when we go in a lot of people are pretending to be u s citizens and then there are some people who are
7960182 our goal is to make sure we work as quickly and efficiently as we can so that u s citizens and legal permanent residents are free to go
7960183 were trying to create a culture of compliance so that businesses would start to have incentives to hire only people who are legally entitled to work here
7960184 are providing the incentive for at least some of these illegal aliens to get out of here before they are deported i dont think there are enough raids there should be more
7960185 i am a citizen of this united states i was born here im not who theyre looking for i wasnt allowed to leave i couldnt go anywhere and couldnt do anything neither could my children
7960186 i didnt want to scare the heck out of my kids
7960187 i was trying to be cool and calm for my children my heart was racing
7960188 my kids should not have had to watch these things they saw people being led out in handcuffs these are people who are recognizable to my children
7960189 this is something im pretty passionate about it shouldnt have happened the way it did
7960190 can ask people questions that doesnt mean people have to respond
7960191 not supported by probable cause not supported by any law
7960192 police will reasonably close the doors to the house and detain everybody
7960193 mse has rejected hundreds possibly more of applicants due to improper documentation
7960194 theres a lot of racial profiling if you look like a hispanic youre detained or arrested
7960195 and to take me to jail just over a mistake
7960196 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7960197 still a long way from oil and gas infrastructure but gas traders will be keenly focused on direction magnitude of this summers first storm to potentially impact energy markets

7960207 except that the egg and sperm packets rise underwater to the surface rather than fall to the ground
7960208 an increase in water temperature of just a couple degrees celsius results in visible damage to adult corals and their offspring
7960209 corals are most vulnerable when they are very small and our protected nursery will help them to get through the first critical days
7960210 poachers often collect wild corals to satisfy the demand for aquariums but aquarium professionals are looking for alternative less destructive sources of these animals secores goal is to develop methods to eventually breed corals in captivity thereby reducing some of the pressure to collect corals from the wild
7960211 we are starting by raising juveniles from wild caught eggs and sperm which enables us to provide aquariums with the corals they desire without damaging wild adult colonies in return the aquarium operators help us to perform the experiments and give us tips on how to raise adult corals in captivity which is something they are very good at
7960212 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7960213 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7960214 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7960215 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7960216 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7960217 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7960218 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7960219 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7960220 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7960221 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7960222 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7960223 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7960224 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7960225 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide
7960226 a device that measures cancer specific gases in exhaled breath would change medical research as we know it
7960227 improved methods to detect molecules have been demonstrated and more people need to be using these methods to detect molecules given off from cancer we have developed laser based methods to detect molecules mid infrared lasers can measure suspected cancer biomarkers ethane formaldehyde and acetaldehyde
7960228 you often have to go outside your discipline to pioneer new areas of research and oklahoma has an advantage with so many experts in other fields but getting funding for interdisciplinary research is challenging however more capital and research infrastructure are needed for this device to become a reality as we build upon our existing capabilities oklahoma can become more widely known as a center of excellence in this important area
7960229 the science supports it and the dogs tell us there is something there
7960230 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate dr charles said
7960231 it shows that australian doctors should resist the push which is occurring in some parts of the world particularly the us to prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics to treat essentially all possible causes
7960232 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics dr charles said
7960233 by continuing to use more traditional antibiotics to treat most cases of pneumonia australian doctors can limit or delay the emergence of more resistant strains of bacteria
7960234 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs
7960235 furthermore in the us canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections

7960278 it has been twenty years since the events of diablo ii of those who faced the lords of hatred terror and destruction in the battle over the fate of sanctuary there are few still living who can bear to remember the horrors that the prime evils wrought upon the world and of those who did not witness the terrible events firsthand most believe the stories to be little more than myth but something evil is stirring once again in tristram and it may already have claimed its first victim deckard cain
7960279 is there a reason you decided to go with a battle net model instead of an mmo model the simplest reason is thats the game we wanted to play a lot of the time thats how we make our decisions at blizzard as gamers and fans because we like our games too so what we really want is a game kind of like diablo 2 but better and we feel like the genre some genres have a lot of progression in them with rpgs and fpss you get a ton of them but this genre has not had a ton of games in it so we felt like theres still so much to say here and theres so much to say on the wow side for mmos but weve got that and dont necessarily need another one right away so we felt like it was really important to do the true diablo sequel as players thats just what we wanted to play

7960281 we believe that heb 5 12 and 6 1 2 acts 8 17 18 and 19 6 laying on of hands with prayer upon baptized believers as such is an ordinance of christ and ought to be submitted unto by all such personas that are admitted to partake of the lords supper and that the end of this ordinance is not for the extraordinary gifts of the spirit but for eph 1 13 14 a farther reception of the holy spirit of promise or for the addition of the graces of the spirit and the influences thereof to confirm strengthen and comfort them in christ jesus it being ratified and established by the acts 8 and 19 6 extraordinary gifts of the spirit in the primitive times to abide in the church as meeting together on the first day of the week was acts 2 1 that being the day of worship or christian sabbath under the gospel and as preaching the word was acts 10 44 and as baptism was mat 3 16 and prayer was acts 4 31 and singing psalms amp c was acts 16 25 26 so this of laying on of hands was acts 8 amp ch 19 for as the whole gospel was confirmed by heb 2 3 4 signs and wonders and divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost in general so was every ordinance in like manner confirmed in particular
7960282 we believe that acts 16 25 eph 5 19 col 3 16 singing the praises of god is a holy ordinance of christ and not a part of natural religion or a moral duty only but that it is brought under divine institution it being injoined on the churches of christ to sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs and that the whole church in their public assemblies as well as private christians ought to heb 2 12 jam 5 13 sing gods praises according to the best light they have received moreover it was practiced in the great representative church by matt 26 30 mat 14 26 our lord jesus christ with his disciples after he had instituted and celebrated the sacred ordinance of his holy supper as a commemorative token of redeeming love
7960283 love should be the silver thread that runs through all your conduct kindness gentleness long suffering forbearance patience sympathy a willingness to enter into childish troubles a readiness to take part in childish joys these are the cords by which a child may be led most easily these are the clews you must follow if you would find the way to his heart
7960284 you should try to make them feel confidence in your judgment and respect your opinions as better than their own you should accustom them to think that when you say a thing is bad for them it must be bad and when you say it is good for them it must be good that your knowledge in short is better than their own and that they may rely implicitly on your word teach them to feel that what they know not now they will probably know better hereafter and to be satisfied there is a reason and a needs be for everything you require them to do

7960309 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7960310 experts who have studied motor vehicle fatality trends said one reason for the dramatic decline is that people are reducing their nonessential driving first which is often leisure driving at night or on weekends
7960311 it is a virtuous cycle where high gas prices lead to lower speeds and smaller cars lower speeds mean fewer and less destructive accidents and less need for so much heavy crash protection and air bags leading to even lower fuel consumption smaller lower perhaps even more vulnerable cars lead to more interaction with other people on the road like cyclists we dont need hydrogen cars and new technology we just need better smaller designs lower speed limits and no big suvs on the road to squish them

7960401 furthering the kingdom of god by equipping christians in theater arts
7960402 is very tolerant and that extends to christians too we feel accepted on the same terms that everyone is accepted
7960403 when to say no and when to say excuse me
7960404 we are stepping beyond something that is strictly an evangelical piece
7960405 we are trying to nurture good plays but written by people who have a particular view of life that happens to be consistent with the christian outlook of the world but the idea is that it is still a good play and not a good play because it espouses this it is a good play and it does this
7960406 you cant be a theater person and be ignorant of those things
7960407 raise questions christians should be wrestling with what is my position in the world what is my position to others how do i deal with struggle and strife
7960408 if we dont win those kinds of states were going to be in that pardon my language i know its early that proverbial s t house for four more years ok sisters and brothers that is where we will be

7960412 an italian priest says he is organising the worlds first beauty pageant for nuns to erase a stereotype of them as being old and dour
7960413 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7960414 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discreet charm
7960415 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case anymore

7960429 if we mute the biblical gospel by our misunderstanding or by our practice in the church we destroy the possibility of spiritual authenticity in the church in theory most evangelicals assent to all of this in practice many evangelicals especially those of a marketing and emergent kind are walking away from the hard edges of these truths in an effort to make the gospel easy to swallow quick to sell and generationally appealing they are very well aware of a deep cultural hunger for spirituality in the west and they are trolling in these waters the problem however is that this spirituality is highly privatized highly individualistic self centered and hostile to doctrine because it is always hostile to christian truth evangelicals gain nothing by merely attracting to their churches postmoderns who are yearning for what is spiritual if in catering to this the gospel is diluted made easy and the edges get rounded off the degree to which evangelicals are doing this is the degree to which they are invalidating themselves and prostituting the church

7960444 green globes is more of a tool than a standard we think they are very complementary
7960445 leed is clearly a standard that has gained wide acceptance and carries a lot of meaning for people in the marketplace particularly for new construction
7960446 the marketplace is begging for a tool that will enable a quick assessment owners who have a large portfolio of existing buildings want to know where they stack up in terms of leed we think green globes is a great tool for doing that baseline assessment and generating some recommendations to improve the buildings overall performance
7960447 we really see it as more of a tool in fact were already looking at some enhancements to link it to energy star weve already had some discussions
7960448 but those numbers even considering jones lang lasalles commitment are small in the face of this tremendous challenge of greening 5 1 million commercial buildings
7960449 as an industry what we have here is a good start but theres a lot more work to do
7960450 there are few efficient tools like the green globes go green programs that allow owners to bring their entire portfolios up to these standards
7960451 when we consider opening an international office we know that the first few years will require more investment with less return
7960452 you can go to the hotspots and hope to do work or you create relationships and let the clients tell you where they need you
7960453 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
7960454 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
7960455 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
7960456 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
7960457 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7960458 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7960459 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7960460 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so
7960461 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7960462 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7960463 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7960464 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7960465 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7960466 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7960467 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7960468 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7960469 the doe nasa collaboration on this new observatory has been very successful and shows what can be accomplished when we work together
7960470 we look forward to the scientific discoveries it will enable in both particle physics and astrophysics
7960471 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds
7960472 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the powerful phenomena his namesake telescope will discover
7960473 what impressed me the most is that everything went by the book
7960474 hes reading the wall street journal and im reading an architecture magazine hes looking for an industry and im looking for one good project
7960475 small firms dont have the resources to weather a downturn
7960476 to change from a founder leader to the next generation is something that weve been working on for 15 years its an evolution
7960477 he does not have a distinct architectural style where people will look at his building and say thats a gensler building
7960478 architecture has to be appropriate its about solving problems one of the problems is aesthetic its the most obvious but its not necessarily the most important
7960479 at that time interior work was really done by housewives
7960480 the culture very early on was to work on business to business terms not be interior decorators
7960481 most architects are generally embarrassed to ask clients for overdue bills
7960482 we had a re education process for people who carried that attitude people make a science of floating their late payments and if you let them theyll work it to the max
7960483 being the oldest of four boys the closeness to art was a little overwhelming
7960484 i wanted to make my own way in life so i got as far away from design as possible
7960485 we agreed on a couple of ground rules going in the main one being that we would never let anybody or the company come between us thats always a risk when you go into a family business
7960486 weve fought about issues and im sure there are hard feelings on both sides but at the end of the day our father son relationship is different than our business relationship
7960487 when were all together we tend to talk about the business a little bit it doesnt consume us but it can certainly be a big part of a dinner conversation everything from individual projects to clients to strategic initiative you name it
7960488 people talk about us being a large firm and its like yeah were the tallest fifth grader in the class
7960489 were trying to build a truly multi disciplinary global design firm
7960490 we believe very strongly in the role of transdisciplinary research we believe its the future of design education
7960491 this one can cure cancer and this one is one saved my dog from a bear its so great
7960492 furthermore if god has no claim on us then we are free free to be animals like our evolutionary ancestors free to be as low down as snakes and to make pigs of ourselves and to act like donkeys
7960493 unlike a lot of medicine psychiatry seems to be more than a little subjective

7960501 is it really worth it to damage what could be a great reputation for playing the game fairly or are you ok with having that crowd of doubters who think and maybe know that you cheated to get where you are im not so i keep it white hat mind your reputation it will follow you and if respect is a word that means something in your life you need to be cautious

7960508 information including but not limited to a formula pattern compilation program device method technique or process
7960509 some common examples of low tech trade secrets in published cases are customer lists business leads financial information marketing strategies sales techniques and methods of conducting business the definitions of trade secrets in the virginia act uniform act and the restatement are significant in several other respects as well these definitions do not require that the information exist in some tangible format as is the case in patent law in fact the information need not be more than an idea theory or concept further these definitions do not require that the trade secret be novel several courts have stated that novelty is not a requirement for a trade secret but that maintaining its secrecy is necessary in addition those definitions do not impose any limit on the length of time a trade secret can be protected while patents may be protected by statute for twenty years trade secrets may be protected as long as their secrecy is maintained they are not generally known and they are not readily ascertainable the virginia act and the uniform act do not require a profit motive for the misappropriation

7960512 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

7960520 im curious about how much you charge to review non compete agreements
7960521 i started my new job 6 months ago and now my boss wants me to sign a noncompete agreement can they do this the answer is yes
7960522 i signed this non compete agreement 3 years ago i have not seen it in years and dont know exactly what it says will i get into trouble if i go to work with a competitor of my company
7960523 i had no intention of starting my own company and serving these old clients
7960524 i left my old job to start my new company
7960525 i didnt ever take proprietary information home or load it onto my home computer
7960526 sign this non compete that limits your right to work and ever make money again
7960527 they have told me if i dont sign this non compete i wont get my severance package can they do that
7960528 yes they can unless it was previously agreed upon in a separate contract they have no legal obligation to give you the money and you can chose to sign and take it or walk i know its not a great choice but it is yours to make

7960545 when each of us spends the 1 coin we make a difference for our country because the 1 coin is durable and using it saves the nation money we hope our pilot cities lead the change

7960555 ill be recording frequent commentaries about the numismatic market and these will be available around the clock on the home page of the pcgs price guide
7960556 weve also added an online database for the price history of significant coins sold at public auctions since 1997
7960557 on any given day there are more than 184 000 current prices listed in the price guide and the historical data base contains more than 6 4 million prices
7960558 we anticipate even greater use of the price guide now that these new features and enhancements have been added
7960559 due to an inability to pay its debts in gold or silver during the civil war the u
7960560 initially resisted by the people who were accustomed to the established gold and silver coinage the legal tender act of 1862 firmly established the paper money as a legitimate form of currency in the united states
7960561 the notes were quickly released into circulation and were used nationwide for the payment of both public and private debts
7960562 we know that the very first 1 note serial 1 was saved and many believe that it still resides with the chase manhattan bank in new york as salmon p chase is depicted on its face surprisingly this very first 2 note was simply turned out into circulation and after making its way through the pages of history both as a circulating note and as a part of several collections is now heading for auction to begin the next phase of its remarkable journey
7960563 the note is a true miracle of survival and obviously has circulated for quite some time having been graded very good 8 by pcgs currency
7960564 this is an important piece of american history and deserves an honored spot in a fine collection
7960565 overall this auction was very well supported by donors and bidders several of whom expressed a hope that the sale would become an annual event the accg board of directors wishes to sincerely thank all who participated in the sale as donors or bidders and especially those who helped to organize promote and conduct the sale

7960576 the seller offered a coin album with 80 fake coins that are confusingly referred to as chinese ackey an ackey is a silver coin minted in england in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and intended for use in parts of africa thus the use of the term here indicates a different application possibly indicative of the coins illegitimate status

7960647 continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed onto
7960648 so far weve seen a series of unfortunate decisions by the russians that only serve to further isolate them
7960649 and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions

7960683 i had often heard of this work with its curious illustrations by the brothers de bry hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me the engravings were indeed interesting drawn wholly from imagination and careless descriptions and represented negroes with white skins and caucasian feature nor would i soon have closed the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired nerves and revived my sensation of disquiet what annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at plate xii which represented in gruesome detail a butchers shop of the cannibal anziques i experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so slight a thing but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me in connection with some adjacent passages descriptive of anzique gastronomy

7960719 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7960720 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7960721 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7960722 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7960723 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7960724 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7960725 theres a media spin on it that were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long thats kind of the perception but i dont know anyone like that im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost

7960737 with mgs4 the theme and the world and also many of the gimmicks that i put in the game these are really personal for me
7960738 in the near future i hope interviewers will ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7960739 this order continues the filling of the sales pipeline for powershield in our first month of production in tianjin with the date for opening established our china sales force has been given the green light to begin accepting purchase orders with this order we now have over 400 000 in orders scheduled for production when the plant opens during the next few weeks we also expect to begin converting distributor purchase commitments into purchase orders
7960740 it does and i put it this way we believe that investment in our own intellectual properties as particularly phil harrison and i tried to do in the last five years with singstar or with the getaway or with buzz these are ours we can put them in our cupboard
7960741 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform i think only larger devs should make multiplatform titles as they have much more resources it would be more prudent for smaller devs to make games exclusive to a platform as they would not have to diversify their resources and fully focus on one platform ps3 80gb ntscj sony klv 37u300a 37
7960742 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7960743 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
7960744 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7960745 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
7960746 its so easy to make things look like theres something sinister about them
7960747 i guess every single word ive ever said is going to be dissected now
7960748 i went to law school on a full academic scholarship the only one in my law school to have a full academic scholarship

7960750 well this is just my policy but i dont want to give an exclusive character for any particular console and that applies to downloadable characters as well because its not very fair when you think about this as a board game or a tool hidden characters if were going to talk about hidden characters they wont be hidden any more

7960790 today is more likely to be the ph d the elites are becoming more fascinated with personality while working class voters are more educated than ever before they face everyday life problems they want to know what the proposal means how it is structured for them the elites dont have the same connection to the everyday problems
7960791 its very surprising that one of the biggest events of the year is in fact the state of the union that lasts like an hour youd think americans wouldnt be interested in it youd think theyd want to watch the super bowl or the world series but they love to watch the state of the union because average voters are into the issues theyre into being serious
7960792 i f theyre into it why dont we see more of it on television
7960793 well thats because the elites have gotten more interested in the opposite the big newspapers are hiring more style and personality reporters a lot of the average working class citizens are moving to the internet they are getting a lot more information on the issues and proposals than ever before they are consuming tons of information part of the point of the book is that youve got to treat these voters with respect because they know so much more and they are so much more issue oriented than people have been giving them credit for

7960804 in 50 years of interviews jerry siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery
7960805 your father dies in a robbery and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the worlds greatest hero im sorry but theres a story there
7960806 superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability
7960807 supermans invulnerability to bullets loss of family destruction of his homeland all seem to overlap with jerrys personal experience theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for superman
7960808 i believe i have the first accurate account jerrys father wasnt shot and robbed he had a heart attack during a robbery
7960809 had no pensions no contracts no health benefits and companies didnt even pay for the artists supplies when these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves they were either collectively cast out or made false promises
7960810 having their names listed as supermans creators was the biggest victory of all
7960811 kurt vonnegut jules pfeiffer will eisner eli wallach and his wife were there
7960812 walter cronkite came on and they showed superman flying and he described what had happened at the end he said another triumph for truth justice and the american way jerry and joe were there and it was a very emotional moment there wasnt a dry eye in the place
7960813 here you have people in their 80s and 90s seeing their comic book work being taken seriously

7960816 on the gameplay front theres a balanced mix of classic samba and new additions
7960817 original hustle and volleyball are all available weve even added a new career mode where players progress through and unlock new game elements and a training mode where new players and veterans alike can learn everything from the basics of playing samba to advanced techniques there are three completely new stages two new characters for you to meet and two new minigames to play
7960818 most third party games arent able to use miis but samba fits the wii so perfectly that nintendo gave us the go ahead the game will also take advantage of the friend roster and leaderboards using everything the console has to offer
7960819 everyone involved really cared about bringing the game up to date and keeping it fun and their efforts really show
7960820 i cant under our warner bros embargo talk about the ending but i can tell you that you will not be interacting whatever youre alluding to you wont be doing that obviously its a massive i was so shocked when i read it i put the book down and said thats crazy you cant have done this were dealing with it very sensitively because its a big deal right obviously were making a game that kids are going to be playing as well

7960861 signora come pensavo non c nessun altro posto libero in classe economica ho parlato col comandante e mi ha confermato che non c nessun posto neanche in classe executive ci rimasto libero soltanto un posto in prima classe
7960862 vede e insolito per la nostra compagnia permettere a una persona con biglietto di classe economica di sedersi in prima classe ma viste le circostanze il comandante pensa che sarebbe scandaloso obbligare qualcuno a sedersi a fianco di una persona sgradevole
7960863 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende

7960911 i liked it during the old days when you could create and iterate
7960912 you can but it will cost you 2 million dollars
7960913 you cant expect the same guys on your team to do the new high level work

7960918 i would have to say that it is more likely that the koreans distribute for free but they
7960919 but they are dealing with the headwinds of a weakening overseas situation and a stronger dollar

7960932 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7960933 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7960934 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7960935 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7960936 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7960937 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7960938 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7960939 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7960940 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7960941 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7960942 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7960943 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7960944 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7960945 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7960946 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7960947 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7960948 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7960949 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7960950 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7960951 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7960952 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7960953 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
7960954 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7960955 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7960956 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7960957 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7960958 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7960959 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7960960 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7960961 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7960962 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7960963 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7960964 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
7960965 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
7960966 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7960967 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7960968 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7960969 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7960970 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious

7961814 i dont mean that every day becomes perfect if we enjoy art but having spent much of my own life looking at it i have come to feel that everything even the most ordinary daily affair is enriched by the lessons that can be gleaned from art that beauty is often where you dont expect to find it that it is something we may discover and also invent then reinvent for ourselves that the most important things in the world are never as simple as they seem but that the world is also richer when it declines to abide by comforting formulas and that it is always good to keep your eyes wide open because you never know what you will discover

7961867 i have little doubt that the pretensions of siam over kelantan and tringanu will now be definitely settled so that no future doubts will be allowed to exist on this point it is clear to me from all the correspondence on the subject that for a long period of years siam has been endeavouring to induce the two states to acknowledge her sovereignty but hitherto has never succeeded in the attempt though in order to avert an attack the chiefs sultan have consented to offer the quinquennial tribute ufti

7961875 i travel a lot by plane and i realised that the plane perhaps was not going very fast during takeoff
7961876 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7961877 there were children who had seats on top of them all i did was pull them out and set them aside so they werent trapped
7961878 i know people are making much of this but i did what any person would do in those circumstances
7961879 i feel immense joy because i was born again and immense sadness for everything that happened i would have liked it if just as i escaped the others did as well
7961880 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7961881 dont fear that you shall have only mutton chops and a rice pudding
7961882 having dreamed of lamb and spinach and a salade de saison i sat down in penitence to a mutton chop and a rice pudding
7961883 it was imposing on old cheeseman to give him nothing but boiled mutton through a whole vacation but that was just like the system when they didnt give him boiled mutton they gave him rice pudding pretending it was a treat and saved the butcher
7961884 my father and esther are having roast fowl three vegetables and four kinds of pudding

7961892 bread baking day 12 an event started by zorra at thanks for aparna i had to post these for you before i disappear
7961893 daddy please turn off the lightning its keeping me awake
7961894 i cant sleep the lightning and thunder scare me please turn them off
7961895 to do that we have to go to the lightning switch we can go in my rocketship if you want
7961896 a rocketship i didnt know you had one of them
7961897 youll have to open your window to switch it off
7961898 youll have to whack that switch back the other way
7961899 is it the pretty girls with big you know whats is that it them wiggling around and hanging out all over
7961900 you know i think it has something to do with seeing a girl triumph in the end get the man win succeed all that i think women have been so beaten down by the world that its good to see one of them win at least on the screen
7961901 but you know nothing about real women how we think how we feel inside why is it that you love watching these women so much in contrast to reality
7961902 i think its kind of that on the screen you have a simple structure men can get the woman in a way that doesnt happen in real life you know probably within the first few minutes of the film what she really wants what shes going after what shes all about theres no guessing theres no looking at her face and trying to figure out if shes angry or frustrated or totally in love or what you know by the way the movie unfolds everything shes thinking and feeling and i think some men like that like me for once we feel like we understand and even know this person in contrast to most of our encounters with women in real life
7961903 well i think human history is the great story of all great stories god is writing this incredible story with twists turns knock downs horrible sins and so on but god has shown us in the bible that theres a happy ending that the good guys and girls win in the end that evil does not triumph see when directors try to do movies that are ambiguous or where evil wins in the end or where no one wins they usually fail we as people intrinsically want to see good triumph we want to see the good people win we like getting there too seeing them down at the bottom with nowhere to look but up we like to see them pounded down a little but in the end we want a win
7961904 of course it does i always make some sense its the archetypical story its why so many stories are like that person has a problem the problem gets worse he or she cant solve it on their own people reach out to them they join forces at some point it looks so bleak you think theres no way then they pull the rabbit out of the hat and everything is perfect for the last few seconds of the story anyway
7961905 so what you want is simple women you can understand and a happily ever after ending and youre happy
7961906 well its a pretty standard hollywood formula books novels too as you said the archetype i guess god has built that desire conviction whatever you want to call it into us and we react to anything not like that with rejection and sometimes even anger i get that i think really almost everything relies on that principle at some point except people like oliver stone and the weirdo movie directors and writers who insist on telling us the world is a horrible place theres no good and we all lose in the end
7961907 well diz how do you explain your love for your girlfriend of several years
7961908 my chemical reactions respond to her with a chemical called love and her chemical reactions respond to me thats all

7961921 its a larger opportunity to say what shes been saying for the last couple of months and its obviously a bigger stage
7961922 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7961923 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
7961924 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
7961925 were delighted the governor has seen the situation as we do and as needing to be resolved by a public hearing
7961926 we intend to present evidence that proves the mayor did not misuse public funds for personal gain and that there was no failure to appropriately inform city council about the facts of the court ordered settlement
7961927 the governor is the sole tribunal in removal proceedings with no right of appeal or review afforded the accused if the governor acts within the law the governors decision is final

7961940 i wonder if the blogosphere will evolve or as i fear remain semi cro magnon
7961941 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
7961942 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
7961943 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
7961944 absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation
7961945 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom
7961946 itll be very interesting to see what the united states does here our invasion of iraq somewhat hamstrings our options in georgia not just militarily but also diplomatically and i guess you would say morally lets watch our un ambassador zalmay khalilzad dance the delicate dance
7961947 has spent millions of years evolving in the dirt and detritus yet peculiarly enough didnt put in the little extra effort required to become a snake
7961948 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
7961949 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
7961950 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
7961951 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
7961952 and it says no one has ever been able to eat one never not once
7961953 you could you can eat anything you should go there if you eat the whole thing they dont make you pay for it
7961954 you eat everything dad ive seen you mom makes spaghetti or that rice and sausage stuff we all love you eat like eight plates of it
7961955 gardner i dont think ive ever eaten more than two or three
7961956 yeah but the plates are piled like a foot high
7961957 its okay dad at school were supposed to respect everyone even fat people
7961958 there are lots of fatter people all kinds some with behinds so big they cant even fit in a regular chair
7961959 but i dont know if they could eat this cheeseburger like you could
7961960 cause i dont know whether theyre fat from eating too much or fat from a gland problem we learned that too
7961961 thats a person who eats and eats and eats and keeps on eating and really never stops hardly at all except to sleep or go to the bathroom
7961962 well you eat a lot but not that much i dont think
7961963 and you think i could eat a six pound cheeseburger just like that
7961964 do you know how much a big mac has on it meat wise
7961965 in that case how many big macs would fit into a six pound cheeseburger
7961966 actually a big mac has about a quarter pound of meat in it so how many quarter pounds would fit into a six pound burger
7961967 okay lets say there are four big macs in a one pound cheeseburger how many would be in a six pound cheeseburger
7961968 great so have you ever seen me eat twenty four big macs
7961969 but you think i could still eat this six pound burger
7961970 yeah but dad if you ate twenty four big macs youd have to pay for all of them that would be like a hundred dollars but if you eat the six pound burger youd get it for free thats why i think you could eat it
7961971 so youre not only saying im fat but im also cheap
7961972 if i tell you you wont kill me will you
7961973 if you say it out loud im going to stop the car let you off here go up fifty yards turn around and run you down at a hundred miles an hour
7961974 if you hold onto the chorus itll get you through the night
7961975 every car owner should review the owners manual pay special attention to the boxed information in yellow
7961976 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
7961977 there is some risk involved all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7961978 we just finished getting rid of a guy named hussein in iraq and why are we trying to elect someone with the same name

7961982 we will not abandon our work if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaida would take full control over our area

7961991 during his reign shih huang ti destroyed the existing feudal structure and divided the empire into 36 provinces under a centralized administration networks of roads and canals were engineered and the major part of the great wall was built weights measures coins and written characters were standardized in a quest for cultural uniformity yet this also led to the burning of all books that diverged from official chin philosophy and history on his death shih huang ti was buried in great splendor entombed among 6 000 terra cotta soldiers for him to summon in the afterlife his autocratic rule and belief in magic had caused such resentment that the chin dynasty collapsed four years later even though it formed the model for all later dynasties

7961994 i spent my childhood revelling and luxuriating in lovely descriptions of meals and picnics and treats and found that it was the taste memories that lingered on long after the details of plots had faded from my mind childrens literature contains a feast a banquet a menu gastronomique of treats and delicious foodstuff this is my top 10 evocative mouth watering and memorable food moments from the past
7961995 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
7961996 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
7961997 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
7961998 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
7961999 hes angry at us and cant wait to send us all to hell

7962010 in fact burmese history does not entirely support his statement that whenever a burmese center became the most powerful it would exert influence on ayutthaya in order to forestall ayutthayas political interference burmese leaders during the mighty reigns of the early restored toungoo empire in the first half of 17th century did not adopt the policy of defeating or weakening ayutthaya for the purpose of maintaining her internal stability the condition of the formation and development of the restored toungoo empire was not in need of an offensive strategy towards ayutthaya
7962011 additionally he propounded that burmese kings always considered the siamese kingdoms as part of their field of power from the founding of the first toungoo dynasty up until the end of the monarchic period almost all of the strong kings waged war against the siamese kingdoms since they expected total submission from successively the ayutthaya thonburi and bangkok kings however according to a contemporary burmese inscription in the 17th century shmkm v 1998 148 ayutthaya was not included in the mandala or the realm of power of the restored toungoo kings in fact the strong kings of the dynasty toung oo did not launch any grand scale attacks on ayutthaya as lieberman remarked
7962012 finally on the origins of the burmese invasion of ayutthaya during the reign of alaunghpaya r 1752 1760 he commented that the root of alaunghpayas hostility toward that kingdom was less obvious than it was in the case of manipura for

7962122 taking part in something like is something ive wanted to do for a long time but i had to wait until i had the time to devote my full attention to it i decided this year was the best chance id get
7962123 i struggled with body image while in high school i really feel into the trap of wanting to be super skinny it weighs on you and it weighs on everyone at some point i know what its like to have a good day be dependant on getting a smile from the boy you like and if that doesnt happen having it turn things upside down
7962124 i want to tell them to not hold back on doing something just because they are afraid they might fail failing is not the worst thing that could happen i was very afraid to get on the stage and answer questions but i did it and im glad that i did even if i hadnt been crowned i still have the knowledge that i tried
7962125 after the process to be selected miss kelowna was over the road to miss canada was nine days long we were watched by the judges every step of the way because someones true personality comes out after spending more than a week travelling around in a small bus the judges had a hard task because any of us woman would have been a good choice
7962126 unfortunately my family wasnt able to travel to toronto to watch the final selection actually a lot of us didnt have any family there to witness the event because it was just too expensive for them to travel so we cheered each other on when i made the top three the other girls prayed for me because they knew that was really important to me
7962127 when we launched u pass last year ubc o students asked for transit service between vernon and kelowna

7962129 im not the kind of guy who gets stressed out easily but i am starting to get a bit worried about where im going to stay i plan on being in kelowna on september 1 to be ready for school and may have to stay in a motel for a while until i can find something
7962130 there is a real housing crunch in kelowna right now and a lot of our students are dealing with the situation there is currently no space in our residences and housing in kelowna is scarce and expensive
7962131 once the particles are deposited into the lungs they tend to accumulate theyre basically like ultra fine shards of glass that penetrate into the lung tissue and the body tries to attack it but it cant break them down
7962132 i dont want to see them in subdivisions i would like to see them in places where there is going to be a mine which is technically what gravel pits are they would have to comply with all the mining regulations
7962133 what that allows the developer to do is actually comply not with the regional district guidelines for developing land but with the mines act for gravel pits which have far fewer regulations so in effect by getting a mines permit the developer can dive under the rules set by the regional district to protect the environment
7962134 it may mean that we will have to pay more for gravel but at what point do we want to safeguard peoples health
7962135 i feel that a cellular tower like this does not belong in a residential neighbourhood

7962144 we know this for all sorts of behavior in kids you dont tell kids to do one thing and then do something else kids very quickly pick up on it when their parents arent practicing what theyre preaching
7962145 you can really put them in a room full of unhealthy food somehow theyre going to find a way to eat healthy

7962149 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
7962150 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them
7962151 we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby

7962154 only by combining detailed modelling of economic responses with spatially and temporally complex climate projections can we appropriately direct resources for mitigation and adaptation without the synthesis of these fields policy responses can be incoherent and counter productive as in the case of the recent rush to biofuels
7962155 combining detailed modeling of economic responses with spatially and temporally complex climate projections
7962156 we must hang together or assuredly we shall all hang separately
7962157 theres a really important discussion going on about how to think about the economics of climate change the key player is marty weitzman who has made a simple point albeit using very very difficult math thats nicely summarized at env econ
7962158 maybe thats right but none of the linkages between biofuels oil prices food price rises increased protectionism etc play any part in any of the models for the costs and benefits of climate change adaptations mitigations or impacts dont you think they should
7962159 the free market will invent new technologies to address these problems
7962160 keep smoking because if one day you develop cancer the free market will develop a cure
7962161 while it may be overly harsh to stereotype economists as favouring economic instruments lawyers as preferring traditional regulatory approaches scientists as preferring research and business people as preferring voluntary approaches or self regulation such an assessment is probably not too far from the truth
7962162 our natural world is abundant infinite in extent stable and capable of absorbing any abuses puny humans inflict thus we should focus on increasing consumer demand in order to create wealth and stimulate the economy
7962163 but that was in another country and besides the wench is dead
7962164 the past is a foreign country they do things differently there
7962165 the structural relations within and between human societies and their environments form the most complex systems known to science
7962166 ignorance of remote causes disposeth men to attribute all events to the causes immediate and instrumental for these are all the causes they perceive
7962167 linkages between biofuels oil prices food price rises increased protectionism etc
7962168 there are some nifty charts of carbon reduction resources which show long bars below the line for technologies which save a lot of money and bars rising above the line for technologies which cost money but no one ever discusses these charts in the context of what happens if we as a society invest to the extent justified in the technologies which save the most money they get cheaper and better and the bars get bigger further below the line which is zero cost
7962169 it seems that the african continent is showing the way ahead we would like to invite you to a public panel discussion
7962170 what happens at the macro level effects the micro level and vice versa with resonances equivalent to the relevance of the individual event
7962171 humans are not nearly as rational maximizing gain minimizing loss as economists make them out to be
7962172 what happens at the macro level effects the micro level and vice versa with resonances equivalent to the relevance of the individual event
7962173 metal tools allowed for more efficient cultivation but then you ended up having a bigger population that needed more land and the feedback loop goes on until you run out of arable land
7962174 martin weitzman a harvard economist who has been driving much of the recent high level debate offers some sobering numbers surveying a wide range of climate models he argues that over all they suggest about a 5 percent chance that world temperatures will eventually rise by more than 10 degrees celsius that is world temperatures will rise by 18 degrees fahrenheit now for the bad news sheer irresponsibility may be a winning political strategy
7962175 the source of nuclear energy at the suns core is essentially continuous in fact increasing at a rate of about 1 in 100 million years
7962176 they suggest about a 5 percent chance that world temperatures will eventually rise by more than 10 degrees celsius that is world temperatures will rise by 18 degrees fahrenheit
7962177 we simply dont have enough data to absolutely preclude a sensitivity that unlikely but the tail is a lot thicker on the positive side than the negative
7962178 roughly ten thousand times larger than the probability of a large asteroid impact
7962179 its a proud day no states have ever done this before
7962180 its a huge huge deal that we got this done
7962181 you americans live to work we filipinos work to live
7962182 i also think the 5 probability for 10 degc rise is also a scientific absurdity
7962183 a man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to leave alone
7962184 we have no way to know what the absolute surface temperatures were more than 1 million years ago and our knowledge of historical co2 levels is limited to order of magnitude estimates
7962185 climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
7962186 listen up you ghgs stop absorbing infrared radiation and stop accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans this is economics talking we were discovered way back at the dawn of the age of steam so we therefore naturally rule that goes for you too thermodynamics adapt to economics or else
7962187 if everyone had settled for an amish lifestyle wed possibly not got into this present mess
7962188 the guy seems to need to be reminded that economics has been studied and examined much more and for much longer than climate change hence it makes more sense to me that climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
7962189 really economics is the study of the entirety of human interactions
7962190 the guy seems to need to be reminded that economics has been studied and examined much more and for much longer than climate change hence it makes more sense to me that climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
7962191 is there a definitive answer to computer climate models are what they really mean for modelling the recent past and the future with any degree of accuracy
7962192 everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others and no one can find a safe way for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction therefore everyone in his own interest must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle
7962193 the persistent communities i make in my computer model clearly work very well ill therefore take one of these communities and try to rebuild it from scratch using only the dozen or so species that make up the community
7962194 any attempt to impose large amounts of short term pain will inevitably face strong opposition because people will stop believing in agw as soon as it is no longer in their interest to do so
7962195 maybe if we ignore the environment it will just go away
7962196 in real life minimum wages hurt far more poor people than they help
7962197 but none of that changes the laws of physics or economics
7962198 after all the dinosaurs flourished for 50 million years or more without ice wouldnt we be better off without it too
7962199 the national center for atmospheric research an important hub for work on the causes and consequences of climate change has shut down a program focused on strengthening poor countries ability to forecast and withstand droughts floods and other climate related hazards
7962200 in a context of a return to a free market just changing that one policy would be all skewed up we are far from capitalism and free market in this culture anyway because of progressive taxation and designed government driven inflation with relentless increase of the government sphere we are lumbering through social democracy on the way to out and out so cial ism frayed word because it triggers spam detectors seems to march along no matter which party is in power must be what we want as opposed to what we made our revolution about 225 years ago
7962201 i dont want anybody to obstruct my lust for power
7962202 the cultivation of self interest and encouragement of private profit is not essential to economic efficiency an individual desire to be of service and to increase the wealth of the whole society can be an equally strong motivation work does not need to be seen as a necessary burden but as a desirable activity with physical social and spiritual significance and benefits allowing each person to have a recognized role and to make a constructive contribution to society just as the total productivity of an ecosystem is the sum of the net productivity of each organism within the system so does each incremental contribution of some good or service add to the total wealth of the community
7962203 some experts have pointed to climate change as a factor
7962204 and the average soil temperature in areas around the caves has risen by two degrees centigrade since 1982
7962205 market forces are really terrible for dealing with environmental problems
7962206 the us did its level best to destroy democracies in any country that had anything valuable
7962207 nothing adapts fast enough to make this a smooth transition its going to be very messy
7962208 but then you took it to ridiculous and silly extremes shows again your interest is in lambasting capitalists not improving economies
7962209 the trade theory assumes that we send apples to australia and they send something else to us presumably something that they can produce more efficiently than apples
7962210 why the heck didnt that get taught in history class i wonder
7962211 just an observation if you would look for info other than in your butt you wouldnt say things like
7962212 market forces are really terrible for dealing with environmental problems
7962213 the us did its level best to destroy democracies in any country that had anything valuable
7962214 im the ceo of a big company with a large workforce turnover so i must get much more money
7962215 capitalism is a primary cause of most of the problems we face not a wise solution that secures a sustainable future
7962216 usa caused the overthrow of 75 democratically elected governments since ww2
7962217 the chief executives of americas 500 biggest companies got a collective 38 pay raise last year to 7 5 billion thats an average 15 2 million apiece
7962218 has it escaped your attention that the worst pollution on record happened in the ussr and eastern europe neither of which could be remotely called capitalist the black sea is a sewer vast swaths of forest are gone and half a century after the chelyabinsk waste dump exploded its still radioactive central planners can be just as bad for the environment as capitalists
7962219 in a post marxist world looking for deliverance is there a better way
7962220 the needs even the survival needs of persona must never be a legal claim on
7962221 as acknowledged in 151 above wont canada russia and other northern nations who have vast lands of fertile soil but it is too cold there to grow important crops suddenly become enormously important
7962222 central planners can be just as bad for the environment as capitalists
7962223 to be interdependent as we inherently are is not to be slaves to each other
7962224 lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and environment is a serious and dangerous hallucination
7962225 some rob you with a six gun some with a fountain pen
7962226 having an infinite number of players is not repeat not the definition of a free market
7962227 so even if there is only one manufacturer of a pant de farter as long as people are informed about the item it exists in a free market
7962228 climate change is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen and it interacts with other market imperfections
7962229 i didnt say the existence of supply and demand curves made a free market
7962230 mark you are maintaining that unless a market is a perfect free market
7962231 for your minimum wage scheme to work the supply and demand curves would have to be the same curve that can only happen in a command economy and the us is no closer to that than it is to a pure free market
7962232 ill readily stipulate that the labor market is not perfectly free but the supply curve is still up with price and the demand curve is still down with price
7962233 when the last cooling cycle resumed 800 years ago the greenland wheat farmers simply walked away from their farms
7962234 wont canada russia and other northern nations who have vast lands of fertile soil but it is too cold there to grow important crops
7962235 for the period from 1900 to 1980 142 of the 144 glaciers retreated
7962236 the evidence presented here unambiguously shows that five of the six major tributaries that formerly nourished the disintegrated portions of lis have recently experienced important dynamic perturbations this includes not only the detected acceleration and retreat 16 but also an active surging
7962237 accelerated ice discharge in the west and particularly in the east doubled the ice sheet mass deficit in the last decade from 90 to 220 cubic kilometers per year
7962238 between 1997 2004 annual mean sea ice concentration has decreased by 17 mean ice thickness has decreased by 0 9 m or 36 ice volume decreased by 40 which is gt 2x the rate of ice area decrease if this trend persists the arctic ocean will become ice ice free by 2013
7962239 america was once a paradise of timberland and stream but it is dying because of the greed and money lust of a thousand little kings who slashed the timber all to hell and would not be controlled and changed the climate and stole the rainfall from posterity and it wont be long now it wont be long
7962240 33 1 or about 303 089 000 hectares of united states of america is forested of this 34 4 or roughly 104 182 000 hectares is classified as primary forest the most biodiverse form of forest
7962241 the second largest continuous area of forest in the world the central african rainforest
7962242 if all countries of the world could eliminate or virtually eliminate deforestation as canada has done this would have an impact comparable to eliminating fossil fuel emissions in the united states in terms of advancing ghg mitigation efforts
7962243 the government of british columbia has dramatically increased logging in an attempt to slow the spread of the beetle by removing recently infested trees and to recover value from trees already killed
7962244 democracy and economic planning the political economy of a self governing society
7962245 it is obvious that economic growth is ultimately unsustainable especially given the narrow capital based definition used to define the term
7962246 the delta of the great colorado river where once it swept into the gulf of california used to be the most wonder filled wetland in the whole north american continent some 400 species of plants and animals including jaguars beaver and the worlds smallest dolphin thronged its 3 000 square miles of wetlands lagoons and tidal pools the local people made a good living fishing its teeming waters now it has become a forbidding desert of salt flats and giant heaps of dead clamshells the fishing boats have been long since beached the destitute people have to seek what work they can in wheat fields and tortilla factories far away
7962247 the worlds great rivers are drying up at an alarming rate with devastating consequences for humanity animals and the future of the planet
7962248 in tropical areas hydropower reservoirs may be much worse climate polluters than even coal power plants
7962249 deficiencies of neoclassical microeconomics that depends on its wildly inaccurate picture of human decision making its fixation on equilibrium phenomena and its cornucopian assumptions about natural resources

7962293 sen sununu is trying to focus his ad on anything but the economy because his policies have been so disastrous im not sure were going to see him talk about it at all in this campaign

7962298 richard littlejohn you made my day thanks for a great read and a great laugh for a terrible moment i worried that maybe the bus roof opening up was a terrorist attack it must have brought back terrible memories for those injured in the 7 7 attacks or who lost loved ones it was silly tasteless and not well thought out why did the london performers represent multiculturalism rather than british culture has british culture died now and been replaced by ethnic cultures why was the ethnic girl tayyiba dubhwala the winner of the blue peter contest that determined who got to be in the show the chinese used ethnic chinese children i notice could it be because blue peter is on the left wing anti white bbc

7962313 sen mccains comments last week are only the latest in a long line of statements revealing that the modern republican party either doesnt understand or doesnt care how deeply their trickle down policies have damaged the american economy
7962314 weve got to come to a national consensus at republican policy writ large has been bad for the country
7962315 by putting together statements its intending to show how broad their denial has been
7962316 hes got a lot to prove to me i f i had to base my vote on how his supporters have treated us id be voting for mccain
7962317 the ads have been particularly vicious and misleading toward jeff merkley

7962320 mehrere sms von stefan aus dem fr hjahr liegen unserer redaktion vor inhalt
7962321 und es kommt noch dicker die effenbergs pr sentieren ihre angebliche traumehe bald dem volk als fernsehseifenoper und tats chlich stefans geburtstagsfeier anfang august begleiten mehrere kamerateams wir wollen wissen wie es um die beziehung steht doch unsere reporter bekommen keine antworten
7962322 ich gebe dieses interview weil ich w tend bin wegen der show die da bald kommt die benutzen da unsere geschichte um diese tv geschichte zu machen und ich m chte auch dass die wahrheit endlich ans licht kommt
7962323 i also want to look you in the eye and i appreciate your generosity but i also want to tell you we will compete in the state of california we will compete and win in the state of california we will not take your money and leave
7962324 i was elected by over 84 000 democrats in western kentucky to represent hillary clinton and if her name is on the ballot that is what i plan to do
7962325 generally the party is as organized as its ever been
7962326 you had all the presidential candidates in nevada using a lot of resources developing their own campaign organizations and because of that theres an infrastructure thats never existed before
7962327 in talking with the clinton supporters in the delegation there still some sense of intense disappointment i havent heard anyone say they arent going to stop obama when its all done but they were really looking forward to being clinton supporting delegates and nominating for the first time a female candidate for president
7962328 you all may remember just 5 years ago we had a somewhat difficult primary in the governors race in kentucky
7962329 there were some of us that werent terribly happy about it on all sides there were some bruised feelings
7962330 i want you all to know and i want to make it perfectly clear that i am strongly supportive of bruce lunsford
7962331 if there ever was an example of democrats fighting like hell and making up thats it
7962332 this has turned out to be a little bit more of a morning than i expected
7962333 ben i am very humbled by what you said there are things in my life that i wish i hadnt done and i try to change them every way i could and certainly 2003 i would love to have it to do over again
7962334 i always support the democratic candidate and there never was any doubt about that
7962335 bruce lunsford made an effort to reach out to me and i have to give him credit he made a special effort to tell me that he was not happy with the way the 2003 race went and that i think he said it today if he had to do it over again he would take it back
7962336 i appreciate that gesture on his part i thought it was decent and i thought it was fine of him to do it
7962337 there never was any doubt and i never said anything to the contrary
7962338 i was elected by over 84 000 democrats in western kentucky to represent hillary clinton and if her name is on the ballot that is what i plan to do
7962339 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7962340 newly designed gapless microlenses over each pixel to reduce noise
7962341 now you have a device that perhaps needs a port or wired drop at the desk and may also need to be supported on a wireless network so the number of means by which employees can connect to the network drives the size of the network in terms of end points of connectivity
7962342 properties of supportive relationships form the perspective of academically successful individuals with autism
7962343 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
7962344 its one thing to still be doing it but to still have your records played on the radio and to have contemporary success thats whats exciting
7962345 radio has said to me in so many words if you do great work well play it but if its average youll have to stand in line
7962346 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7962347 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7962348 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7962349 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7962350 generally expected to be weak during the remainder of 2008 before recovering modestly next year
7962351 seen as potentially exacerbating the contraction in the housing sector
7962352 i walked down the street with my head held high
7962353 the power to chastise and imprison his wife to take the wages which she earns the property she inherits and in the case of separation the children of her love
7962354 it often comes down to the fact that they are busy trying to make ends meet trying to work and also care for their children
7962355 i generally feel like the candidates address issues that get them the most votes across the board
7962356 many topics that men care about are also those women care about the war the economy the climate terrorism
7962357 you might reasonably feel that you didnt have a dog in the race now or ever
7962358 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause
7962359 but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7962360 im not going to say one thing in richmond or in danville and another thing at the democratic convention in denver i understand some folks may not like that but you know im a job applicant
7962361 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident
7962362 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
7962363 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7962364 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7962365 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7962366 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7962367 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7962368 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7962369 theres a media spin on it that were all out of touch how could we possibly have an awareness of what real americans feel and think and need because we just ride around in limos and i dont know buy diamonds all day long thats kind of the perception but i dont know anyone like that im certainly not like that im a passionate american and thats what i am first and foremost
7962370 we live in a mud hut with only two rooms i dont know how were going to afford 10 children now
7962371 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
7962372 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
7962373 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7962374 unlike the last time we went to the moon everybody is going to the moon now there are at least a dozen proposals i know of from various countries to go to the moon
7962375 this is going to open a new era of scientific understanding of not just the moon and the formation of the earth moon system but how we can live on another world
7962376 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7962377 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7962378 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7962379 if we can work in antarctica for 50 years and still want to go back and do more the moon also is at least as interesting as antarctica
7962380 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7962381 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
7962382 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
7962383 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
7962384 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile
7962385 with humans going back the lunar environment needs to be studied and studied well
7962386 if i were a betting man i would say the lunar program is here to stay
7962387 ive been trying to get nasa to adopt a mission statement of why were going to the moon not six themes not 182 different sub goals
7962388 were going to the moon to learn the skills we need to live and work productively on another world
7962389 its not the next nasa program it is not an entitlement to the science community it is not a rocket building program it is a strategic direction
7962390 by integrating the electrical home appliances industry we expect consumer lifestyle products from both industries to become more popular and international trade visitors to express even keener interest

7962397 i feel that he has violated his trust the trust we put in him as president that he would act according to the bylaws and standing rules of the association he flagrantly violated by making this secret agreement
7962398 anything i would say would not be in the spirit of where we are trying to go as a board
7962399 and just to keep bringing up stuff that happened over a year ago when we are trying to move forward with this organization is pointless
7962400 once you start opening that particular avenue for people they can make all kinds of arbitrary decisions and then come back and say it was in the best interest
7962401 mike day did not have a majority of the board
7962402 president mike day is doing a very good job of bringing people back together and moving the association forward
7962403 we have good procedures and we have good people in place
7962404 and it serves no purpose to go over and over something that happened a year ago
7962405 the office thoroughly reviewed state farms filing and the testimony the company gave at the aug 12 public hearing
7962406 state farm did not provide appropriate support for the rate increase it requested
7962407 he accelerated and we made it out of the intersection
7962408 then we heard an explosion like someone burst a bunch of soda cans
7962409 the two cars the honda and alero crashed into each other just about 30 feet from the intersection they were side by side but it was hard to see who hit who
7962410 not as much no but sometimes if im out ill say im ashley or if im making reservations for restaurants instead of saying my name ill use my sisters actually most of the time
7962411 i would love to be able to swim in the ocean in malibu but that is asking for a bikini shot thats inviting something that i dont want to happen i dont need to be on a whos skinny whos fat whos looking healthy whos not eating list
7962412 hopefully mk can sneak in a dip in the ocean before the summer is over after all she could just tell everyone the bikini photos are ashley
7962413 men of quality are not afraid of women who want equality
7962414 i really cant go into that because its a medical issue
7962415 she was in the process of having the baby so they couldnt go anywhere with her so they just went on and she had the baby here and then they took both mother and daughter to the hospital

7962509 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
7962510 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government

7962885 whether it s an article directory or any other high traffic well established site a link prominently displayed on an authoritative site is a good link lumping all article submission sites together is rather unfair because they are all certainly not the same
7962886 many have pitiful pagerank and bury your article deep within their pages to boot that s why we implemented our bidding system at ideamarketers you have the chance to be featured on pages that search engines give more weight to we include anchor text links in the listings as well which makes them all the more valuable so while some links from poor quality article directory sites are most likely not worth much links from well established heavy hitters can still help your link popularity
7962887 yes its still worth using the article directories as a way to accumulate inbound links links embedded in your content will pass link popularity provided the directory pages theyre sitting on have been indexed
7962888 mix up your anchor text and use links to your internal pages as well as your home page doing so helps stream link popularity and visitors to your revenue producing product pages

7962891 there is so called third party content on web sites some of which can gather data about how you browse the web how do you know what that is or how to control it
7962892 the only way to ensure that your data is not disclosed is to block content and prevent communication
7962893 i think that with regard to anything that has to do with consumers perceiving that their privacy is being invaded the marketer or the organization is going to suffer
7962894 most consumers are extremely uncomfortable with data being collected about them when they dont know its being done or for what purpose
7962895 look its the users computer users should have the right to make those decisions
7962896 if the user wants to block advertising they certainly should have the right to do so
7962897 the problem with privacy features that are developed for browser software is they typically require users to make a lot of decisions and stay on top of add ons for example in firefox so we would prefer to see a strong privacy safeguard technique built into the browser and thats what microsoft seems to have done here

7962933 het is een homofobe reactie van de katholieke kerk die probeert te verstoppen dat er homoseksuele priesters bestaan
7962934 de beslissing van het vaticaan om een lichaam uit zijn rustplaats te halen is gravenschennis en religieuze ontheiliging het schendt de uitdrukkelijke wens van de kardinaal om voor eeuwig naast zijn geliefde te worden begraven na meer dan 100 jaar wil het vaticaan die rust verstoren zodat ze kunnen verbergen dat er kardinalen waren die mannen liefhadden het is een beschamend en onterend verraad van de homohatende kerk tegenover de kardinaal
7962935 het heropgraving past in een proces van canonisatie waarbij de overblijfselen van de kardinaal naar een plaats zullen gebracht worden waar pelgrims makkelijk naar toe kunnen om de heilige in wording te aanbidden
7962936 niemand betwist dat de kardinaal en de priester erg veel van elkaar hielden hij zei zelfs dat zijn verdriet na de dood van st john vergelijkbaar was met dat van een partner die haar of zijn partner verliest maar daarmee bedoelde hij niet dat het huwelijk hetzelfde is als een homoseksuele relatie het is fout om met de ogen van vandaag de teksten van toen te lezen de relaties in de victoriaanse tijd konden heel intens en passioneel zijn maar ze waren niet seksueel het celibaat werd gerespecteerd daar zijn heel veel bewijzen van

7962982 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7962983 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7962984 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
7962985 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7962986 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
7962987 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
7962988 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7962989 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
7962990 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
7962991 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
7962992 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7962993 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7962994 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7962995 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
7962996 the tour will rely on its communication staff to help identify players who need to be evaluated

7963052 and lets admit the truth some of the people judging you will inevitably be mean power mad incompetent or just plain crazy ive seen people in all kinds of senior management jobs that i wouldnt allow to litter train my cat and yet they were responsible for hundreds or thousands of careers
7963053 intelligence imagination and cunning are all required here but not underhandedness i dont believe you need to be devious to succeed in fact i think being excessively political is a mistake i also dont advise turning yourself into a heartless machine if you have no humanity you will inspire no one and no matter how tough the game gets you are more likely to win it if you maintain your sense of fun
7963054 the most valuable employees are those willing to rain on your parade when its necessary willing even to rain on a parade they organized themselves encourage them to come to you even when they dont have a solution sometimes there is no immediate solution to a problem but you need to know what is happening anyway
7963055 the most important barriers you have to set up between yourself and the people you manage are social and emotional this is directly counter to one of the most common workplace clich s people who work well together are like families if your idea of yourself as a boss is somehow to be the head of the family or the respected older brother or sister i have one piece of advice for you get a life marry somebody make a family of your own just admit to yourself that once you hit higher management the people who work for you are not going to love you they may very well not even like you
7963056 its inevitable as you rise that you wind up managing areas of your organization that are completely unfamiliar to you most management books will tell you that the answer to this dilemma is to hire people who are smarter than you in those areas you know little about thats half an answer as far as im concerned of course you do that but its not that simple first of all how do you know theyre smart enough if you know nothing about their subject they only have to be a little bit smarter than you to seem really smart and how do you get these people to do what you want when you dont fully understand what they do my advice is dont insult the experts get some outside help instead hire a consultant you trust who can help you understand whether your people are doing the right thing dont hit them over the head with the consultant either use her discreetly just to keep yourself informed of potential problems
7963057 unless your boss is very very strong he is likely to have moments of paranoia as you gain power and he suddenly feels your hot breath at the back of his neck nothing is more frightening to most bosses than the idea that someone they have brought along might become their boss the mentor thinks he is the hare and youre the tortoise he may do wonderful things for you early in your career protect you teach you encourage you but if you catch up to him it can get really ugly mentor relationships often end in such train wrecks
7963058 my advice is dont hitch yourself to the best manager
7963059 you know what id really like to retire early but im not going to because david is really depending on me
7963060 though its contrary to some conventional wisdom about how to succeed i highly recommend having interests outside of the office interests that you can pursue without people from the office dont take so much work home with you that you look like a donkey at the end of the day whether its on your computer or in paper form you probably wont look at it anyway try to avoid the star trek language of executives which eliminates all emotion in favor of basis points leverage and click through rates make friends who have nothing to do with your organizational life and dont sacrifice your family for your job no matter how important

7963178 documents why the pay gap is not about discrimination but about 25 differences between men and womens work life decisions
7963179 when womens pay is significantly greater than mens it can be in male dominated fields female dominated fields or well integrated fields
7963180 the average man would rather be sold to by a woman than by a man
7963181 and whenever people break traditional roles the people who do the role breaking tend to be highly motivated and good they make more because they are so good and because people like going to a woman because its a novelty
7963182 add to this the fact that top level executive males would prefer to be presented to by a woman than by a man and also that female financial analysts are in shorter supply and you have a blend of characteristics that are likely to make a female financial analyst on average more valued
7963183 put in the hours people who work 44 hours per week make twice as much as those working 34 hours thats 33 percent more work for 100 percent more pay which makes it cost efficient to hire out cleaning errands etc

7963196 the secretaries of the various departments within the conference such as the secretary for education secretary for youth and the other ministries will be elected today
7963197 there was a commitment in early 2007 that elections in fiji will take place in march 2009 and there is every reason that the country should work towards that date as it is in the best interest of our distinct and diverse communities that elections are held as it marks the commencement of democratic processes whereby the will of the people will determine our future as a nation
7963198 our country cannot afford to continue to fall into prolonged periods of uncertainty of our governance as it may breed various forms of negative impacts on the people

7963208 ive visited fiji five times with my family spending a lot of time in buca bay and i can see a great need for pre school education in the area i want to contribute to this wonderful country in this small way
7963209 since the start of the project we have brought in six teachers and other helpers from the us to start the kindies and teach the teachers
7963210 the council raised concern on how the bureau of statistics is calculating the inflation rate using the old basket of goods and services which do not truly represent consumer spending
7963211 the bureau of statistics has been calculating the cpi based on a consumer basket of goods and services from 1993 the last revision of the consumer basket of goods and services was done 14 years ago
7963212 i know that these markets in particular new zealand and australia are in many senses mature that are not to say just older travellers but well developed in their knowledge of fiji
7963213 the core markets are our bread and butter and they need constant attention to ensure revenue streams remain strong
7963214 in the environment of escalating fuel costs long haul routes such as los angeles length or similar become increasingly risky to undertake as the overall cost of mounting the services is very high
7963215 the risks of long haul are simple to high and potential losses too great to start any route that does not have a high degree of success on paper first
7963216 once the work is completed we will be able to house up to 40 inmates
7963217 work is expected to be completed by late october at the moment we are concentrating on the main cell block
7963218 we want to target schools and the business community in our awareness program
7963219 we also have the opportunity of a radio station allowing the department to conduct talkback shows with members of the public in creating awareness of the project
7963220 we are grateful to stakeholders for supporting the department in its drive of the yrp
7963221 i did my time but when i came out in 2005 whatever rehabilitation program i had to take did not have any effect on me
7963222 after my release i went right back into my criminal activities
7963223 my wife and kids did not know what i was up to until police showed up at my front door and told my wife
7963224 late in 2005 i went back to prison where i was kept in solidarity confinement for four months
7963225 thats when i decided to change my life after seeing all the pain and hurt i had caused my immediate family and my children were very young
7963226 when i got out of prison many of my family members the church which i belong to and the community had lost faith in me
7963227 what broke my heart was when my second youngest son who was a baby at the time i went to prison asked me when i was released if i was his father
7963228 i know i have done my time and my family has suffered in the process but what i want to know is that is it normal for anyone to be followed around after being released from prison even though i have gotten my life together
7963229 my concern is how far will they go in terms of monitoring or following us around despite us former inmates getting on with our life
7963230 we did not know that all the street kids had been rounded up by the cops and the next day the street kids did not show up for classes
7963231 every time the street kids come here they are afraid because they get picked up by police so we went to question the criminal investigation department as to what they wanted with the children and they admitted they had asked the kids as to what were they doing at friend
7963232 we told the cid officers that they should have told us not to work with them and not the other way around but thats besides the point
7963233 last month we had them here all the time but the boys were scared because each time they would come they would get picked up
7963234 these boys are trying to reform and because of kinis association with them as their tutor they assume he is also involved in criminal activities
7963235 prisoners are human beings and should be treated as such
7963236 but many times this is not the case some of them still think they are in the colonial era

7963252 there are 37 schools 17 primary and 14 high schools
7963253 there were concerns to raise the standard of academic achievement
7963254 the schools have done well but they have been asked to keep up the good work and the results of external exams
7963255 school managements were reminded that infrastructures are to be improved so that school environment is a place where children love to study
7963256 a committee is working on a process where conference and church members in circuits and divisions are guided with the churchs position on the charter
7963257 the bullet points will be given to them to take to the people so they can sign their names
7963258 these will be brought to head office then a submission will be prepared and supported by the names
7963259 they will decide if a submission will be made to the ncbbf the interim prime minister or the president of fiji
7963260 the process will be accompanied by fasting and prayer so that the work is taken seriously by our members
7963261 this is the shepherding role of the church to its members in providing advice on issues that can be destructive to their lives and bring negative impacts
7963262 the coup was illegal and so the charter is illegitimate
7963263 we have decided in the next six weeks to counter issues affecting members of the sdl party fijian people

7963267 the seriousness of the original offending and the subsequent act of driving whilst disqualified persuade me that it is not in the public interest to restore the applicants licence
7963268 this application is refused it is open to the applicant to make subsequent applications under the same section
7963269 at this stage however it is not in the public interest to allow the application
7963270 he then applied to the court of appeal and was given permission by justice ward to drive between 6am and 7pm daily

7963273 a group of usp students have come forward with a list of restaurants they suspect of poor hygiene practices
7963274 we would like to include all stakeholders in our campaign the municipal councils in particular play a vital role in our campaign as they are the regulatory authority of the public health act
7963275 the focus should be to remain in dialogue so that we continue to deliver quality and all round services are improved
7963276 the reorganisation may not be drastic and it will depend on how the new programs are arranged we have been talking since last year and talks are continuing

7963278 about 51 per cent of the revenue of the council has been derived from rates and our collection rate has been an average of 67 per cent per year

7963280 on the other hand the council provides services to not only its 8162 ratepayers but everyone who enters and uses the city

7963289 basically they have told us they cant help us that there are too many obama supporters ahead of charlie on the line
7963290 we have a wealth of talent within our itparty and very limited speaking roles
7963291 there is a limit on how many people you can have speak from one area
7963292 and to have the mayor governor and u s senator speak is totally appropriate

7963387 its a horrible blow for anyone to endure were committed to making sure these people get back on their feet
7963388 youll see a home that is mostly unaffected then next door it will be destroyed the amount of devastation is something you cant prepare for
7963389 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
7963390 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
7963391 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7963392 a lot of the fall is due to the increase in public coverage
7963393 this satellite will collect gamma rays from the most energetic regions of our galaxy and beyond
7963394 working in the research institutes building on ellis avenue in the late 1940s enrico fermi produced the first quantitative ideas on how cosmic particles could reach the enormous energies needed to produce these cosmic gamma rays it is wonderful to hear that nasa has decided to dedicate this satellite to him

7963402 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket
7963403 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7963404 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7963405 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7963406 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7963407 as the wall street journal tells us the fed and the office of the comptroller of the currency are issuing more

7963410 the need is clear civil society wants it very much the european commission might be part of the discussion explaining what needs to be done because it gives a helping hand to member states but ultimately nobody can do the job except bulgarians themselves
7963411 bulgaria will pass through this period im sure i know were determined people and wed like to see the country in good shape
7963412 to attach an adjective such as corrupt to the name of a country gives a really bitter feeling we are a country of more than 7 5m people the wrongdoers are not more than 200
7963413 please get to know us better we are not different we are not in the union because the union is desperate to have one more alphabet

7963417 weaknesses in the economic record as regards unemployment inequality and poverty

7963469 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7963470 we must emphasize the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and the stability and peace of northeast asia honor our commitments strengthen mutual trust and work together to push the six party talks
7963471 german carmakers want co2 targets to only apply to the cleanest cars in the early years its the equivalent of demanding that a smoking ban should only apply to non smokers
7963472 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7963473 key to increasing the number of new congressional and senate seats
7963474 thats because were democrats were conservative to moderate democrats but were proud to be democrats and were proud to be at the dnc
7963475 where they should be back home in their districts raising money and with their voters theyre not at home because theyre not good democrats theyre out there fighting the good fight winning to ensure their majority in the house
7963476 if you took all the fraud out of politics there might not be a lot left the reason so many people misunderstand so many issues is not that these issues are so complex but that people do not want a factual or analytical explanation that leaves them emotionally unsatisfied they want villains to hate and heroes to cheer and they dont want explanations that do not give them that has anyone noticed yankee pitcher joba chamberlains facial resemblance to babe ruth if he can be anywhere near as good a pitcher as ruth was he will have a great career the babe could have made the hall of fame if he had remained a pitcher and never hit a home run he still holds a couple of pitching records although you can block unwanted phone calls from commercial sources you cannot block automated phone calls from politicians which will be inundating us this election year apparently the courts think that the right of free speech includes the right to impose that speech on an unwilling audience maybe we need a new constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom from speech one of the problems with successfully dealing with threats is that people start believing that there is no threat that is where we are seven years after 9 11 so that reminding people of terrorist dangers can be dismissed as the politics of fear by barack obama who has a rhetorical answer for everything
7963477 there are countries in europe that would love to have their unemployment rate fall to the 5 7 percent unemployment rate to which ours has risen yet those who seem to want us to imitate european economic and social policies never seem to want to consider the actual consequences of those policies republicans won big running as republicans in 2004 but once they took control of congress they started acting like democrats and lost big there is a lesson in that somewhere but whether republicans will learn it is another story entirely when we hear about rent control or gun control we may think about rent or guns but the word that really matters is control that is what the political left is all about as you can see by the incessant creation of new restrictions in places where they are strongly entrenched in power such as san francisco or new york
7963478 now that the senator with the furthest left voting record in the senate and the senator with the third furthest left voting are the democrats nominees for president and vice president there will be great expressions of indignation over being negative if anyone dares call them liberals actually leftists would be more accurate right after liberal democrats the most dangerous politicians are country club republicans
7963479 last week obama was busy assailing john mccain because of his answer to a loaded question from politico com when mccain gave the appearance of not knowing how many homes he and his wife owned the simple fact is that mccain may not have known at that precise moment the number of homes or condos he owns in specific legal terms what mccain should have said was that he signed a prenuptial agreement with his wife and he didnt want to misspeak pursuant to the specifics of their property what he did say was ill have my staff get back to you the fact that obama and his minions are creating a tempest in a teapot about nothing shows just how desperate he is owning more than one home is like owning stock they are investments every member of congress with few exceptions owns more than one property many reading this column own multiple homes commensurate with their income and investment abilities and to that point obama is not exactly free from real estate controversy
7963480 obama is only concerned about attacking america and john mccain

7963483 i was scared for the museum on august 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself
7963484 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
7963485 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
7963486 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
7963487 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7963488 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
7963489 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
7963490 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war ii
7963491 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one still knows what the reality was
7963492 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the real facts
7963493 people have always come here from all over the world those who love stalin those who hate stalin and those who are just interested in him
7963494 26 08 08 5 08 pm think selldown is coming very soon and very fast so no long position pls xxx will be the main trigger
7963495 the best manager i played under without a shadow of doubt
7963496 hed stand up to the challenges although he might have been reluctant to move with the times in terms of the scientific side of things but i bet sir alex ferguson would tell you the same
7963497 im pretty sure cloughie wouldnt like whats going on in the game now with fitness coaches taking over prozones weights dieticians pasta and bananas but he would be a success because he was a football genius
7963498 cloughie would have survived hed have adapted and made his mark at whatever club he was at because he knew his football the stuff he used to come up with at forest was so simple and i try to take that into what we do here
7963499 before i made my debut i ended up at his house in derby on the way to anfield
7963500 he gave me a pint of milk i said i dont like milk he said youd better drink it because im putting the bottles out trust me i drank it
7963501 the day after the game he asked me my name gave me a pair of his shoes and told me to polish them if i brought my shoes in for one of the players to polish im sure theyd throw them back at me but modern day players would put up with him if he was still around theyd love playing for him because he was different
7963502 once he made the whole forest first team squash into a five a side goal for no reason but it was brilliant just like a big game of twister
7963503 if someone did that today youd be thinking how has this lad got his a or pro licence you all say why does he do that and thats the beauty of that i dont know
7963504 once he made me go to a charity night with him and at the end he gave me a 50 note id never seen one of those before he was a kind gentleman and did loads of stuff for charity
7963505 las personas deben abstenerse de visitar las playas y balnearios as como la pesca u otras actividades acu ticas
7963506 is that he has been given the nod ive always thought he made his plans according to his conversations with nick
7963507 i think ians pretty confident for a pick im sure he will have got his bases covered
7963508 he would make a great pick hes got such flair such confidence hes the kind of player you want on your side
7963509 i played with darren in the first two rounds and ive never seen him so in control
7963510 que solo le depositaron el primer mes para que votaran por el partido de gobierno y que ya no tienen esperanza de que le vuelvan a depositar
7963511 one of the firemen called me and said the place was full of smoke
7963512 we fuss and fuss at people to get surge protectors and they do work

7963522 the doe nasa collaboration on this new observatory has been very successful and shows what can be accomplished when we work together
7963523 we look forward to the scientific discoveries it will enable in both particle physics and astrophysics
7963524 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds
7963525 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the powerful phenomena his namesake telescope will discover
7963526 what impressed me the most is that everything went by the book
7963527 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7963528 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7963529 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7963530 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7963531 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7963532 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7963533 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7963534 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7963535 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes
7963536 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7963537 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7963538 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7963539 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
7963540 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
7963541 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently

7963551 o relaxamento substancial da pol tica monet ria at esta data combinado com medidas sendo aplicadas para promover a liquidez do mercado deveriam promover um crescimento moderado ao longo do tempo
7963552 em sua discuss o sobre a situa o e a perspectiva da economia muitos participantes notaram que os acontecimentos recentes sugeriam que a atividade econ mica provavelmente continuaria deprimida por v rios trimestres
7963553 a expectativa geral era de que o crescimento da atividade econ mica seria fraco durante o que resta de 2008 antes de recuperar se modestamente no pr ximo ano e quase todos os participantes da reuni o viam riscos negativos ao crescimento
7963554 o crescimento das exporta es havia dado um mpeto substancial demanda geral no segundo trimestre contudo muitos participantes observaram que a desacelera o na atividade em algumas economias estrangeiras tenderia a deprimir os ganhos das exporta es no futuro

7963595 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7963596 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7963597 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7963598 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught

7963659 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century and it was called whiff whaff other nations the french looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner we looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to play whiff whaff

7963697 i am for barack obama he is the hope that the american dream comes back again for the best of all
7963698 it shoud be the very first thing that obama signs as president
7963699 at the end of the day whether they move slowly or quickly hillary supporters know that obama will stand up for the issues they care about and mccain wont
7963700 this is an organization with no known other activities no known financial support of any significance
7963701 the majority of aips annual expenditures are not political expenditures but are devoted to grassroots lobbying and education on issues public policies and other communications activities and programs appropriate to a 501 c 4 social welfare organization in accordance with all applicable provisions of the internal revenue code
7963702 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimidation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7963703 violate the law in both directions both in the raising and the expenditure of the funds
7963704 surely we have not come to a point where the government and its agencies are used to protect presidential candidates from citizens speech essentially destroying the very purpose meaning and historical essence of the first amendment
7963705 ya i know i hate life now i just wana kill people at champion high school and then blo my own head off
7963706 this is a small victory in our determined effort to educate both sides of the aisle that there is a true constituency in america that values its internet freedoms
7963707 my point is simple is the republican party no longer the party of personal freedom and individual responsibility
7963708 why has this party that used to protect my rights now become the party that wants to create a nanny state
7963709 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
7963710 we firmly believe that if this is a big enough issue it would be offered as an amendment
7963711 well wait to see if it comes up as we get to full committee
7963712 hes just really into it with the family workshop he went to
7963713 she just got a taste of my new lifestyle we had spent a lot of time together before camp but it was never time like that being active and eating healthy
7963714 we know this for all sorts of behavior in kids you dont tell kids to do one thing and then do something else kids very quickly pick up on it when their parents arent practicing what theyre preaching
7963715 you can really put them in a room full of unhealthy food somehow theyre going to find a way to eat healthy
7963716 i loved oreos and now i cant even look at that stuff
7963717 it would have been a lot harder i probably would have had a really hard time sticking to the diet and staying motivated
7963718 its really good to know that other people want you to succeed
7963719 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
7963720 you only had the best of the best taking the test
7963721 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings

7963728 we are extremely grateful to geoeye for their collaboration with ubisoft and pleased with the level of quality and service weve received

7963737 regarding u s policy on settlements its clear its the right policy to try to help bring about a political settlement between israel and the palestinians
7963738 are you saying you can get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in new york city but you cant get a charitable deduction for helping starving people in judea and samaria
7963739 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution
7963740 the u s government has no right to use political considerations when judging humanitarian and non profit needs
7963741 dozens of new families can now come live in hebron only if we renovate this building quickly
7963742 why are the americans talking about getting rid of settlements when they are building a new one right next door
7963743 imagine theres no countries nothing to live or die for imagine all the people l 8
7963744 all would be well with the republic if only these loathesome left liberal democrats would stop destroying the democratic party i once admired and might even have joined
7963745 flamers tell themselves their enemies are so vicious they have to be vicious too
7963746 the democrats are in danger of doing to obama what they did to their last two nominees gore and kerry burying authentic individuals under a layer of prefab themes
7963747 immense is the army of michelangelos trying to sculpture the melted marshmallow of kerrys core and tumultuous is the cry of the strategists and loud are the furies of the campaign but in the center there is a silence for in the beginning all was vacuum and a void
7963748 shut them out he turned his back on the universe of geniuses and stayed true to his core identity at the core obamas best message has always been this he is unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics he is in tune with a new era he is authentically the sort of person who emerges in a multicultural globalized age he is therefore naturally in step with the problems that will confront us in the years to come
7963749 is the most split personality politician in the country today on the one hand there is dr barack the high minded niebuhr quoting speechifier who spent this past winter thrilling the scarlett johansson set and feeling the fierce urgency of now but then on the other side theres fast eddie obama the promise breaking tough minded chicago pol whod throw you under the truck for votes
7963750 unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics
7963751 and when democrats are nervous all the santa monica machiavellis emerge from their fund raisers offering words of wisdom and the subtext of the advice being offered this year is that barack obama should really be someone else
7963752 so long was the line of approaching volvos that it was visible from outer space yet still the message was not honed king kerry still did equivocate hedge and reverse of flip flops there were more than a few he still did velcro his principles upon the cathedral door and change them by the hour
7963753 on the one hand obama did sell out the primary cause of his professional life all for a tiny political advantage if hell sell that out what wont he sell out on the other hand global affairs aint beanbag if were going to have a president who is going to go toe to toe with the likes of vladimir putin maybe it is better that he should have a ruthlessly opportunist fast eddie obama lurking inside
7963754 ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that mccain is a good man who happens to be out of step with the times ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that a multipolar world demands a softer international touch ill put a plus down when a speaker says the old free market policies worked fine in the 20th century but no longer seem to be working today these are arguments that reinforce obamas identity as a 21st century man

7963769 bob gwen asked me if i was a christian ive been to church but i dont have the answer to that
7963770 youve been carrying around a lot of guilt and shame his desire is to lift that burden and shame jesus died on the cross for you to wash away all of this guilt and shame would you like him to take the guilt and shame away
7963771 all you need to do is ask him to tell him youre sorry he died on the cross because he loves you admit that you believe this and invite him into your life
7963772 this is why jesus is the only way isnt he

7963774 the indian institutes of technology are considering dropping kota the coaching capital for iit aspirants as an admission test centre amid suspicions of mass cheating in this years entrance exam
7963775 the issue of scrapping kota as a jee centre is crucial because we at the iits can no longer ignore the massive skew in favour of students who clear the entrance after studying at kota the skew is not easily explained
7963776 over the last two years weve made significant investments in education that will benefit middle class families across iowa weve expanded preschool to more four years olds so theyre ready to learn when they enter kindergarten and provided additional support to attract and retain the best teachers for our students students now need a blood lead test and dental screening when they enter elementary school
7963777 if we want more good paying jobs in iowa we need a highly skilled workforce with training beyond high school to compete with workers from around the globe it is essential that higher education be affordable for all iowans and im proud of our work over the last two years to ensure that happens

7963801 growth in disposable income is pushing this up and thats supported by the growth in the economy thanks largely of course to oil exports
7963802 and the market is far from saturated were seeing growth in every segment including the supercars
7963803 were not seeing the kind of tightening of consumer credit thats occurring elsewhere

7963805 the new pbs system will transform the immigration process and operationally make it more efficient in addition to simplifying this for companies the uk home offices pbs is applicable to all companies who employ workers in the uk
7963806 this is very critical given the uk home offices announcement on october 1 2008 being the last date of applications and november 24 2008 as the date when the new system goes live
7963807 the companies that built this dike did a terrible job
7963808 they dont deserve a bailout and doing that would just encourage more shoddy construction besides the dumb people who live here should never have built their homes on a floodplain
7963809 a better approach is for the homeowner to buy an insurance policy that pays off only in the contingency when it is needed i e when the storm hits
7963810 similarly for a bank it may be more efficient to arrange for a contingent capital infusion in the event of a crisis rather than keeping permanent idle capital sitting on the balance sheet
7963811 the added flexibility associated with the insurance option may therefore help to reduce the externalities associated with bank distress while at the same time minimizing the potential costs of public bailouts during crises as well as the drag on intermediation in normal times

7963813 investing in china is about picking the right segments of the economy and the companies that will make it for the long haul
7963814 our strategy for investing involves sticking to a handful of core strategic areas where weve picked a collection of stocks in key industries
7963815 the chinese economy is large amounting to approximately 3 6 trillion annually and its expanding at a rate of 10
7963816 industrial production the heart of the economy is gaining at a rate of 16 3 a year and is keeping a transforming labor force fully engaged unemployment is a scant 4 and retail sales are climbing at a hefty rate of more than 23
7963817 all of this comes at a price inflation is a biting 7 plus pollution is another economic stressor the major underpinnings of the chinese economy are still works in progress although theres a lot to be gained those gains never come in a straight line or without some challenges
7963818 our strategy for investing involves sticking to a handful of core strategic areas focused on energy environment infrastructure commodities and agriculture sectors
7963819 on the energy front oil is crucial to china this means china is helping to propel profits from producers worldwide offshore drilling in the south china sea is a no brainer which means
7963820 an increased need for cleaner water isnt just an issue in china but across the globe billions more dollars need to be invested with some 300 million chinese citizens clamoring for more clean water
7963821 while succumbing to the current market woes we continue to favor one of the worlds top leaders in water and water treatment businesses
7963822 commodities are the fuel for chinas growth were there on the raw side of that deal with the

7963829 i found former rep jim leachs comments to be thoughtful learned and relevant nevertheless he was largely ignored by the crowd to me that was indicative of the lack of organization and unity inside the hall
7963830 that was a very fine speech she was all one could hope for in a future first lady
7963831 the post mrs obama speech moment via camera was cute and relatable just like im sure it was meant to be
7963832 cynicism aside the family dynamic makes obama seem young and vital and also as a good family man
7963833 its not going to be easy we know that from last year weve been saying all year that this is a new year now is our chance to prove it in games like the ones we have coming up our goal is to win the division just like its been all year just like it was last year we remember what happened weve talked about it and now we can do something about it if we keep playing the way we can play if we do that well be fine weve already fought through other things this season last year we didnt really have to do that this is a different team

7963876 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7963877 depending on where you focus on the details of the report you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed record year over year declines were reported in both the 10 city and 20 city composites in june however they are very close to the values reported for may the rate of home price decline may be slowing for the month the 10 city composite was down 0 6 and the 20 city composite was down 0 5

7963883 i think a fact of about alcohol is that it is an attractive drug the more you consume the more you like to consume this is a positive feedback loop you need to have a certain maturity to protect yourself from this loop
7963884 and what we enjoyed doing was to see other people eat
7963885 we would go into a restaurant and order just a cup of coffee and sit and watch other people eat and it bothered us to see people come in only eat half of their food and just leave the other half
7963886 one of the fellows he had somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 packs a day
7963887 may have explained one of the reasons he had problems losing weight
7963888 went into a grocery shop he didnt buy anything he shoplifted and what did he take he took potatoes and carrots and onions root vegetables which were the basis of our diet and he stuffed himself
7963889 what was unexpected about the rehab phase was it ended up being psychologically the hardest phase for most of the men
7963890 the fire was getting low and sam jumped up and said he knew where the woodpile was and there was a hatchet out there and he needed to in order to get the fire started split up a little wood there
7963891 i admit to being crazy mixed up at the time

7963895 this went through the group and we kept on eating
7963896 the food was the important thing we didnt care whether the war was over or not as long as we got our food
7963897 all of them had this lovely combination of pride and humbleness in the way that they spoke about their participation in the experiment
7963898 they stood by their convictions thought of it as an accomplishment but they really all stressed that they didnt have it as bad as the people who were really starving or were out in the field being shot at
7963899 the starvation crisis was over sooner than they thought it would be and it took longer than they thought to publish the experiment
7963900 they published some interim studies with their early results but most of the lasting value of the study came out later
7963901 keys did this study because nothing like it had been done before
7963902 and because of ethical restrictions after wwii nothing like it has been done after and probably never will be done
7963903 what the atom bomb illustrated was that the perpetrator never sees the victim

7963911 we had three senior members on the plane and some other pople they got on and someone hijacked it
7963912 the group is expected to enjoy revenue growth in 2008 with more attention being given to its flagship mobile operations such as celcom xl and dialog telekom
7963913 on the other hand the group seeks opportunity to create more value for its investments in bangladesh and india
7963914 the price now averages at rm2 400 a tonne for every rm100 a tonne drop the group is going to lose about rm200 million in net profit

7963927 we have gone down the environmental path and this is a perfect fit for us and visy
7963928 this gives our relationship some real substance and this is something they are the forefront of so we can push their message to the community and the kids
7963929 richard pratt has made a big commitment to the club and been a fantastic person this is just another contribution to the club and its terrific
7963930 everyone is claiming to have the best facilities but it puts us on a par with the best facilities in australia
7963931 carlton had already teamed with visy to have the aspiration of being the greenest club in the league and we see this as a very significant elevation of that aspiration

7963936 hes the hardest coach ive had to coach against this year
7963937 im not underestimating the other coaches and maybe his teams in career best form but maybe hes in career best form as well
7963938 i think theres definitely been games where deans tactics have got us over the line
7963939 this is his sixth year and every season i can see were getting better at following his instructions and hes getting better at refining them so were not overawed i think weve got that balance now of understanding what the opposition do well and how we can stop opposing teams doing what they want to do and at the same time keeping our basic game plan and structures right
7963940 in that grand final year 2002 part of the reason we were so good was that we were able to pick the eyes out of the opposition game plan and take away what they wanted and make them deal with something they didnt want to face
7963941 thats something i see in north melbourne now of course theyve got their own game plan but i think theyre more chameleon like than other sides and can adapt really well
7963942 youre asking a fair bit of your team because youre asking the group to do different things depending on how to best break down the opposition and that requires a receptive playing group
7963943 so it reflects pretty well on the coach if the group has got the confidence and trust in the game plan he wants to implement on a particular day
7963944 out of his depth as a senior coach and far better suited to being an assistant coach
7963945 i think hes improved out of sight as a match day coach and just as the general head of the footy club
7963946 they play with real spirit theyre direct and he maximises the strength of his good players he makes them think that everyone has a role to play and thats great
7963947 huh never thought of that maybe it would be rad
7963948 oh we need you with the kids your so good with them
7963949 pornography is devastating our children in many many different ways what will happen to these children as they take the damaging effects of pornography into their adult lives how will these scars impact their own marriages and children with the consequences already visible in many families and in society as a whole one can only shudder to think of what the future might hold

7963954 quiero agradecerles algo que tiene m s valor que la inversi n que pueden hacer en el pa s que siempre es un n mero econ mico quiero agradecerles la confianza que han tenido en la rep blica argentina
7963955 eso vale mucho m s que la inversi n sobre todo cuando viene de empresas extranjeras y sobre todo cuando por all escuchamos a alg n connacional que no puesta y no tiene tanta confianza en su propio pa s
7963956 por eso perm tanme agradecerles la confianza en la rep blica argentina
7963957 es muy importante para el desarrollo de cualquier modelo pol tico econ mico que los hombres que deciden las inversiones que generan riqueza a trav s de aporte de capital sumando trabajo tengan confianza y amor por lo que hacen
7963958 es motivo de gran alegr a y demuestra tambi n que el modelo de pa s anda en cuatro ruedas y traccionando para adelante como le gusta hacer a citro n
7963959 hab a solo 80 trabajadores en la empresa y ahora hay 6000 operarios distribuidos en tres turnos
7963960 vamos a seguir trabajando muy fuerte en esta direcci n y vamos a profundizar este modelo que tantas satisfacciones le ha dado no a un sector sino a todos los argentinos que han logrado recuperar calidad de vida a trav s del trabajo y el salario
7963961 uno tiene que estar preparado porque estas cosas en alg n momento van a pasar
7963962 esto se debe a que vivimos en una sociedad absolutamente exitista inadaptados hay en todos lados pero lo nico que se valora es el triunfo del fin de semana
7963963 independiente lleva tres partidos de los cuales empat dos y gan uno

7963965 el predio tiene 25 hect reas el guardia tal vez es nuevo no los conoci y los hinchas se acreditaron como socios

7963969 hab a una manera de jugar que se respetaba pese al rival de turno y eso hizo grande a independiente

7963973 it was challenging i grew up real fast i saw things i might not normally see there were pot seeds around and i would pick them up my mom thought it was funny if i ate them
7963974 i lead a hard life early on so i can lead an early life now
7963975 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
7963976 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
7963977 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
7963978 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
7963979 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
7963980 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
7963981 i feel like im in a really great place in my life and i love what im doing i love acting but i cant hire myself if this works then were in business if not i tried
7963982 its about putting into the universe what you want in life red means love pink is friendship green is lucky black is protection youre gonna have a story when you wear this bikini or when you put this dress on youll either get love or meet a new friend or you might meet a guy
7963983 while nbc is certainly protecting its legacy tv business that isnt necessarily in the short term an unwise thing to do

7963985 dan kami turunkan al quran itu dengan sebenar benarnya dan al quran itu telah turun dengan membawa kebenaran
7963986 aku tidak mengemukakan kepadamu melainkan apa yang aku pandang baik
7963987 dan sesungguhnya aku akan menyalib kamu sekalian pada pangkal pohon kurma dan sesungguhnya kamu akan mengetahui siapa di antara kita yang lebih pedih dan lebih kekal siksanya
7963988 hai manusia sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu dari seorang laki laki dan seorang perempuan dan menjadikan kamu berbangsa bangsa dan bersuku suku supaya kamu saling kenal mengenal sesungguhnya orang yang paling mulia diantara kamu disisi allah ialah orang yang paling taqwa diantara kamu sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal
7963989 sesungguhnya allah tidak merobah keadaan sesuatu kaum sehingga mereka merobah keadaan yang ada pada diri mereka sendiri
7963990 yang demikian itu adalah karena sesungguhnya allah sekali kali tidak akan meubah sesuatu nikmat yang telah dianugerahkan nya kepada suatu kaum hingga kaum itu meubah apa apa yang ada pada diri mereka sendiri
7963991 dan allah telah membuat suatu perumpamaan dengan sebuah negeri yang dahulunya aman lagi tenteram rezkinya datang kepadanya melimpah ruah dari segenap tempat tetapi penduduk nya mengingkari nikmat nikmat allah karena itu allah merasakan kepada mereka pakaian kelaparan dan ketakutan disebabkan apa yang selalu mereka perbuat
7963992 dan kami sungguh sungguh akan bersabar terhadap gangguan gangguan yang kamu lakukan kepada kami dan hanya kepada allah saja orang orang yang bertawakkal itu berserah diri
7963993 janganlah sekali kali kamu terperdaya oleh kebebasan orang orang kafir bergerak 260 di dalam negeri itu hanyalah kesenangan sementara kemudian tempat tinggal mereka ialah jahannam dan jahannam itu adalah tempat yang seburuk buruknya
7963994 i was crying when i was born because i knew right there and then that i was born with the wrong sexual organ
7963995 i endured nine months of conception and i was praying for a vagina all that time so you would imagine my horror when i found out that somebody made a mistake and gave me a dick on my birthday
7963996 sesungguhnya allah telah memfardhukan shaum di bulan ramadhan kepada kalian dan aku syariatkan kepada kalian agar mendirikannya dengan shalat tarawih barangsiap yang berpuasa dan mendirikannya karena iman dan mengharapkan ridha allah swt niscaya ia keluar dari dosa dosanya seperti pada hari ia dikeluarkan dari rahim ibunya
7963997 barang siapa yang melaksanakan qiyam ramadhan karena iman membenarkan janji janji allah swt dan ihtisaban mangharap ridha allah swt dan pahala niscaya diampunkan baginya dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
7963998 bahwa rasulullah saw pernah mengerjakan shalat berjamah dengan mereka sebanyak 8 rakaat kemudian mengerjakan shalat witir 3 rakaat barangsiapa yang melakukan shalat tarawih sebanyak 23 rakaat maka hal itu juga pernah dilakukan oleh para sahabat pada masa khlaifah umar seperti yang telah diriwayatkan oleh sejumlah ulama sedangkan kita juga dibolehkan untuk mengikuti sunnah khulafur rasyidin al mahdiyyin
7963999 barangsiapa yang melakukan qiyam ramadhan dengan iman dan berharap pahala dari allah maka akan diampuni dosanya yang telah lalu
7964000 sesungguhnya kami telah menurunkannya al quran pada malam kemuliaan dan tahukah kamu apakah malam kemuliaan itu malam kemuliaan itu lebih baik dari seribu bulan pada malam itu turun malaikat malaikat dan malaikat jibril dengan izin tuhannya untuk mengatur segala urusan malam itu penuh kesejahteraan sampai terbit fajar
7964001 one reason were right next to the prostitutes is that were in the same business we dont offer love we offer services we look good but we dont know how to love and unfortunately society will settle for that to get what they think they need
7964002 how can we we get new members money into the door
7964003 how can we show the love of jesus to those around us
7964004 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
7964005 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
7964006 i know im going to die but please please let me live until hes in third grade so at least i can see him in a play
7964007 take anything just let me make it to middle school
7964008 all i want is to see him start high school then ill be satisfied
7964009 sweetheart if you actually think hillary had judgement and experience in light of the fact that she voted for the war in iraq and then tried repeatedly to make us lose the war then youre an idiot we dont want your support behind mccain toots so just write in hillarys name or stay home on election day and educate yourself
7964010 barangsiapa di antara kamu hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu dan barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya itu pada hari hari yang lain
7964011 jika seseorang selamat secara baik dalam ibadah ramadhan maka akan selamatlah satu penuh setelahnya
7964012 wahai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kalian puasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas umat sebelum kalian agar kalian menjadi orang yang bertaqwa
7964013 dan sungguh kami telah mewasiatkan memerintahkan kepada orang orang yang diberi kitab sebelum kamu dan juga kepada kamu bertakwalah kepada allah
7964014 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7964015 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7964016 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7964017 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7964018 generally expected to be weak during the remainder of 2008 before recovering modestly next year
7964019 seen as potentially exacerbating the contraction in the housing sector
7964020 the competition in the art field is too high youll never make it
7964021 will so and so still like me if i disagree
7964022 first of course we do not promote higher education as the only option for young people ive been very public in my support for expanding apprenticeships and in making the promise that all young people not just those who go to university can be funded to continue their studies until they reach 25 or achieve a level 3 qualification and it is true that some young people would have been better advised not to go to university but none of this undermines the importance of higher education expansion or of labours 50 per cent target
7964023 there are certainly young people who currently go to university who would have been better off on an advanced apprenticeship we have been in danger of making it sound as if university is the only real aspiration
7964024 if you look at the university system as a whole and the way it engages with employers it needs to be closer more intensive and part of what university offers has got to be tailored for the needs of a very different group of students and the people who are be going to be paying for these courses
7964025 hes giving you his back foot to clean out silly

7964028 as for the accce coalition it was founded this year solely to address the advancing legislation aimed at cutting the emissions of fossil fuels like coal that are blamed for global warming
7964029 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7964030 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7964031 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7964032 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7964033 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7964034 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7964035 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7964036 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7964037 how much celebrity drivel weather reports local cop chases and corporate cover ups from the
7964038 undoing legislation already passed by that other pesky branch of government the legislative
7964039 if you replace world with country you are back to the same debate arguably that you have been having about michelle obamas feelings about the country did she give her critics any fodder with that comment
7964040 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7964041 german carmakers want co2 targets to only apply to the cleanest cars in the early years its the equivalent of demanding that a smoking ban should only apply to non smokers
7964042 i was scared for the museum on august 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself
7964043 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
7964044 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
7964045 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
7964046 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7964047 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
7964048 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
7964049 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war ii
7964050 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one still knows what the reality was
7964051 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the real facts
7964052 people have always come here from all over the world those who love stalin those who hate stalin and those who are just interested in him
7964053 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7964054 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
7964055 what we require the other five parties require is a verification package in order for us to go forward in delisting north korea
7964056 the north is well aware of this we have been very clear and consistent on this point so there should be no surprise for north korea what is required of it
7964057 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
7964058 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7964059 we must emphasize the denuclearization of the korean peninsula and the stability and peace of northeast asia honor our commitments strengthen mutual trust and work together to push the six party talks
7964060 so amp so only kicked 1 on scarlett all his other goals came on multiple other players
7964061 just days after american airlines made the big deal announcement that
7964062 when a man digs a pit and does not cover it and an ox or donkey falls into it

7964083 uniniziativa che non avvicina di un millimetro la soluzione del problema constatiamo che di proposte concrete continua a non vedersi traccia
7964084 e stato il coro degli esercenti che oltre alla serrata hanno gia annunciato nellimmediato
7964085 tuttavia ha proseguito il dirigente comunale da parte dei nostri interlocutori non vedo la disponibilita necessaria ad ottenere accordi che i problemi li possano risolvere davvero
7964086 certo a maggior ragione prosegue bassi servirebbe riunirsi attorno a un tavolo invece proprio mentre il sindaco lassessore competente e il sottoscritto tornano ad essere presenti dopo il break estivo dallaltra parte si organizza una serrata singolare
7964087 we are so excited about what we have in store this year as always we will open the festival with new hampshire night at the music hall on october 16th this year which allows us to showcase much of the rising talent right here at home but what really elevates the quality of the experience is that we are attracting major talent from the industry and that helps us bring top notch experts in the business to speak and educate our participants while theyre here in portsmouth during october
7964088 we now offer categories for all members of the filmmaking community from shorts to features student films and documentaries to animation and screenplays every year the quality of submissions we receive just gets better and we dont expect this year to be any different
7964089 woods hole is well known as a filmmaker friendly festival
7964090 was to sit down and talk with not only the audience but the people who actually selected our film for the festival
7964091 heidi and i saw a dribbles poster featuring emotional comments from two festival selection committee members
7964092 we found out that of the two people who confessed to being choked up and teary eyed by our film one directed a number of stunt action scenes in the original terminator movie and the other was the writer director of the horror film the legend of lucy keyes
7964093 we are very thankful that people viewed our film with open minds and open hearts
7964094 weve been in touch with the nevers band of concord who re enacted the 1905 welcoming parade a film office production coordinator rev gordon allen whose parishioners at st johns in portsmouth created a pivotal scene when the japanese diplomats attended a church service and sam jarvis whose metro restaurant stood in for a london club
7964095 but were trying to identify as many people who took part as we can to capture the story of the filming 26 years ago
7964096 the sensation of sight is an independent film with a huge heart a real gem in cinema rarely found today
7964097 im too smart busy to waste my time doing that
7964098 for this re issue we are using a digital transfer direct from the original 16mm film negative
7964099 were also re mixing the sound straight from the original magstock reels theres still a great deal of work to do but so far its been very gratifying to see the film look as it good as it does
7964100 old man dogs is a heartfelt showcase of raw talent with something to say makes masterful use of the new hampshire outdoor locations director bill millios deftly handles emotional scenes as a calling card for the new hampshire film community old man dogs does the job
7964101 old man dogs is full of moody subtleties which may make the big budget commercial film connoisseur uneasy audiences will walk away saying that they never have seen anything like this produced on granite state soil
7964102 old man dogs is a treat it is to stumble upon something completely different the plot is used as a base for the film to ruminate on life love fate and the need to mourn not an easy sell when it comes to independent filmmaking

7964124 basically we believe that extendicares corporate strategy and policy is to maximize profits at the expense of the elderly and vulnerable people it claims to serve
7964125 we all know that there is a direct correlation between elder abuse and staffing levels in my opinion the extendicare facilities in washington are elder abuse cases waiting to happen its just a matter of whose parents or grandparents are going to be the victims
7964126 this is a class action lawsuit which implies that all residents within the facility during the timeframe specified would have been equally impacted by any and all deficiencies the facilities received in any given survey
7964127 there are approximately 189 requirements that each facility must meet these deficiencies are typically isolated to just a few residents and do not impact most residents in the facility
7964128 when people ask me why im going to guess that part of it is a lack of awareness to what the issues are and the resources that are available
7964129 i think we have an ethical responsibility a moral responsibility and were shirking it
7964130 if you see signs that a person may have been abused you need to ask has anybody hurt you are you afraid of anybody how did this happen if the explanation doesnt fit with what you see you need to probe further
7964131 doctors need to be made aware that if they have a suspicion of financial exploitation patient abuse or neglect they must report
7964132 doctors need to become better educated when dealing with elderly patients
7964133 most of the abuse occurs in the process of giving care to needy frail older people who are not easy to take care of
7964134 he has hurt me a lot every time he bathes me he puts things in me he had sex with me more than once its all the time in the bath
7964135 thats the disservice they did to my mom and my family
7964136 to not even give a standard time frame of taking it to a grand jury is ridiculous
7964137 push it forward so that these individuals can try to protect themselves because theyre very vulnerable
7964138 we should have presented it to the grand jury probably in late 2007 or early 2008
7964139 this case regrettably wasnt addressed in a timely manner and we have taken some in house steps to ensure that situations like this do not occur in the future
7964140 of all the cases i have prosecuted in the hundreds over the last 12 years the kind of case that presents the most problems is allegations of sexual assault in a facility where probably the only witness of the crime is the victim herself
7964141 i think with all elderly victims time is of the essence
7964142 a lot of times an older person is afraid to report it
7964143 they are ashamed or fear retaliation they fear their family might put them in a nursing home
7964144 figuring out how to protect senior citizens from victimization even when its caused by their own mistakes is one of the biggest issues facing us right now but we also have to figure out how to balance our desire to protect vulnerable seniors with their rights to autonomy
7964145 there are cases where elderly members of the family like parents who are admittedly in the twilight of their lives are neglected and left to fend for themselves there are even instances where they are abandoned by their own children without any means of support
7964146 the family has the duty to care for its elderly members but the state may also do so through programs of social security
7964147 staffing is the biggest problem nursing homes face very often we hear them say that this patient is taking up too many of our resources
7964148 they took 62 years of my life away from me in 12 hours
7964149 they dont think that theyll ever have to go to a nursing home
7964150 the majority of what were dealing with is spouses and children
7964151 jury came back with a conviction they acknowledged something was wrong here
7964152 theres a gap in the law there that tim picked up on
7964153 unlike child abuse cases we dont have the array of felonies that can be filed in elder neglect cases
7964154 there needs to be a mechanism in place to increase the penalties
7964155 the facts in this case were legally sufficient to support a murder charge and to go ahead and charge manslaughter or reckless endangerment would have been inappropriate
7964156 when you have other duties to care we have a big hole when it comes to neglect of an elderly person
7964157 and our office believes this case is a prime example of why we need felony manslaughter and felony neglect statutes to cover these situations
7964158 but if we had not stepped in i believe they would be totally broke right now
7964159 all youre missing is the belt buckle that can deflect bullets
7964160 when satan tempts me to despair and tells me of the guilt within upward i look and see him there who made an end of all my sin
7964161 whew for a minute i was afraid my butt was bigger than the seat

7964169 i wish i understood why this is happening to me
7964170 pregnancy is unknown among our kind the doctors have said theyre sure its only temporary your bodys way of nourishing the fetuses
7964171 not that any man would find big fat me in the last bit attractive
7964172 fat or thin youre beautiful as soon as the children are born you will go back to normal
7964173 once the children are born youll go back to your old self

7964181 i should have killed him myself and sent his miserable soul straight to hell
7964182 homework oh homework i hate you you stink i wish i could wash you away in the sink
7964183 hey i see your shirt there i have to show you this
7964184 we have one where a family member has borrowed a significant amount of money for their business which hasnt worked out no repayment of the loan has taken place
7964185 unfortunately it sometimes happens that a older persons life savings will be used up by a family member theyll ask can you help me out then when all the moneys gone theyll say sorry i cant do anything about it
7964186 a lot of cases are also the result of carer stress this is where someone who might not have the necessary skills goes into caring for an elderly person and ends up becoming abusive
7964187 all walks of life abuse gets reported by family members police doctors and sometimes the victim
7964188 okay so ive been thinking we need more layouts more blog entries more everything on scrapwords when people just drop by the site or happen to stumble upon us i want them to be overwhelmed with inspiration so with that being said were going to have a contest
7964189 new hampshire talent means the people used both in front of and behind the camera
7964190 there are so many advantages to shooting in new hampshire theres no sales tax no income tax no general film permits to fill out and the costs for food lodging and other expenses tend to be lower than they are elsewhere

7964196 we are not going to sell steffen he is the best striker we have and we have not found a replacement for him therefore we cannot sell him we cant sell him in the middle of the season

7964198 we will not change our minds we cannot do this steffen is a very important player for us there are a lot more games left in our season and we have no choice
7964199 just because youre number 18 it doesnt mean you wont get in
7964200 what is the cause what is the reason o lord

7964213 there is only one proper cinema in the african republic and that is housed in a french cultural complex film screenings in village halls are frequently suspended during the rainy season the country has no professional actors no film technicians or cinematographers nowhere to develop film stock no government film office no public or private money for indigenous cinema
7964214 he excels at spinning narratives that begin with easily recognizable situations usually the loss of a parent and expand to encompass allegorical and political reflection on the state of chadian society often calm on the surface harouns filmmaking belies this calm with simmering strains of anger and melancholy
7964215 our intention is to show a broad range of films about africa from different perspectives including contemporary african film artists and documentaries that comment on the current state of affairs and films that have not been seen in new england

7964222 well i should probably significantly lower my killings next year and show more allegiance to my mother country
7964223 i really dont want this study to be taken to suggest that allopurinol is a good alternative for treatment of blood pressure in children or adults

7964239 the bill was inspired by an official audit covering a five month period in 2004 which found that because of the loophole the feds had to greenlight 35 out of 44 cases where a gun buyer was on a terrorist watch list
7964240 why was john mccains top adviser paid to allow terrorists to buy guns and what does it say about john mccain that he hired this man john mccain claims to be tough on terrorism but at the end of the day puts lobbyists first

7964409 i did this after the government begged us because they dont have good furniture at the vip lounge
7964410 the government promised to pay up after two weeks but weve been chasing the payment for three months and we feel like beggars this is why i decided to take action tuesday
7964411 imagine if this is a small business they probably will be out of business by the time the government pays up this is not encouraging small businesses
7964412 if the government can pay up its bills with foreign business in time what about us

7964414 were making a very important point here that we do not challenge the immigration provision of the law the covenant permits the federal immigration laws to be applied to the commonwealth
7964415 its a dangerous document because it can have a lot of negative impacts in the lives of fiji citizens especially fijians
7964416 it can create more coups and social and political unrest

7964437 believe me anyone would want to take the airplane to come to this country rather than crossing the river
7964438 im confident that during the first term of barack obama we will have comprehensive immigration reform
7964439 what we need to do is to make it public
7964440 immigration reform is the only way to end the violence at the border it will solve crimes relating to human smuggling

7964920 deveras impressionante o lixo ideol gico que a imprensa tem produzido ao cobrir as olimp adas em geral os rep rteres buscam sempre os ngulos mais negativos mesmo custa de adentrar o rid culo
7964921 o locutor ressalta o car ter repressivo do regime enquanto as imagens mostram como prova disso um grupo de guardas de tr nsito e c meras de televis o que monitoram avenidas o locutor fala do controle do partido comunista sobre as pessoas enquanto na tela aparecem torcedores que preparam uma coreografia manifesta es com menos de cinco indiv duos s o tratadas como acontecimentos picos se houver um pouco maiores a prova de que o povo est contra o governo se n o houver a prova de que a repress o terr vel
7964922 rep rteres monotem ticos escrevem todos os dias sobre a falta de liberdade de express o carregando nas tintas para cumprir a pauta que receberam dos chefes se n o cumprirem ser o demitidos defendem pois uma liberdade que eles mesmos n o t m
7964923 agora que os jogos come aram tor o para que o lixo ideol gico se retraia para que finalmente possamos prestar aten o nos atletas a festa lhes pertence tomara que seja linda
7964924 apoiada pelo servi o de intelig ncia do paquist o que atua em estreita colabora o com a cia a ag ncia de espionagem dos eua
7964925 assuntos separatistas t m de ser tratados com bastante cuidado e com bastante respeito porque podem provocar derramamento de sangue
7964926 os russos n o reconheceram kosovo independente da s rvia sua aliada e amea am que se isso acontecesse eles tamb m poderiam reconhecer a independ ncia da oss tia do sul se kosovo pode por que n o a oss tia e a abkh sia tamb m
7964927 os russos aceitariam os dois territ rios como parte da r ssia mas a ge rgia n o
7964928 o mesmo povo que vive dividido em duas partes pela fronteira russo georgiana
7964929 em 1992 eles declararam a independ ncia e desde ent o s o uma rep blica separatista que sofreu bastante porque os georgianos nunca concordaram com a declara o e sempre tentavam resgatar esse territ rio
7964930 pol tica da boa vizinhan a falando de maneira bastante suave
7964931 o presidente mikhail saakashvili logo declarou suas inten es de entrar na otan e permitiu a presen a dos conselheiros militares dos eua em seu territ rio ent o a orienta o dele est clara posso dizer que isso irrita o governo russo porque a regi o bastante explosiva a tchetch nia se encontra l e o conflito tchetcheno ainda est vivo na mem ria dos russos
7964932 e o nacionalismo georgiano gra as pol tica do mikhail predominante eles est o tentando estabelecer controle sobre as regi es separatistas a quest o n o se eles t m direito mas que eles t m de fazer isso usando os meios legais recorrendo ao direito internacional negocia o e n o ao uso da for a
7964933 saakashvili se sente mais forte para atacar a oss tia do sul porque tem simpatia ocidental
7964934 eu posso dizer lhe em detalhe o que est sendo feito para recolher refugiados e assegurar se de que a vida normal continue na rep blica de ossetia alania norte
7964935 mas antes de mais nada eu gostaria de compartilhar de minhas impress es acerca dos refugiados
7964936 epis dios que contaram que v o para al m dos limites normais de opera es militares parece me que n s estamos vendo elementos de um tipo do genoc dio contra os povos ossetos
7964937 eu penso que seria o plano de ac o correto dmitry anatolyevich para que voc instrua o escrit rio do promotor de justi a militar documentar epis dios deste tipo tanto mais como a maioria da popula o de ossetia sul s o cidad os da federa o russa
7964938 como eu disse eu penso que seria certo o presidente emitir esta instru o ao escrit rio do promotor de justi a militar
7964939 eu emitirei esta instru o naturalmente os promotores de justi a devem certamente investigar todos tais casos n s estamos falando aqui sobre o destino de nossos cidad os para quem n s somos respons veis todos os crimes cometidos devem conseq entemente ser documentados t o completamente quanto poss vel e analisados t o completamente quanto poss vel at trazer acusa es penais contra os autores espec ficos destes atos
7964940 os cirurgi es est o j a trabalhar l e os doutores est o fornecendo o aux lio m dico
7964941 um segundo hospital de campanha est pronto para ser estabelecido no territ rio da ossetia sul e este ir adiante fornecer aux lio popula o civil e ao pessoal militar nestas opera es
7964942 mas a maior preocupa o neste momento a situa o dos civis que enfrentam circunst ncias muito dif ceis agora em tskhinvali
7964943 eu posso confirmar as palavras que voc usou para descrever esta situa o e para dizer que certamente um disastre humanit rio no sentido mais literal
7964944 mas n s estamos prontos para fornecer o aux lio em grande escala assim que as circunst ncias necess rias estiverem no lugar diversas toneladas de medicinas t m sido emitidas j rea e n s estamos prontos para entregar tanto quanto for necess rio se for requerido
7964945 a maioria dos refugiados foram recolhidos por parentes alguns deles est o sendo abrigados em antigos acampamentos sanat rios e escolas
7964946 casualmente este igualmente um problema para ossetia norte porque os pr dios das escolas precisam de ser usadas
7964947 a fim ajudar as pessoas a retornar s suas cidades e vilas natais n s precisaremos conseq entemente de ajud los a reconstruir suas casas e apartamentos
7964948 n s estamos prontos para aumentar esta soma se for necess rio mas precisaria de ser baseado numa an lise s ria da situa o real quanto reconstru o
7964949 violou a integridade territorial da ge rgia e usou for a militar enorme
7964950 estamos dispostos a escutar a opini o das entidades defensora dos direitos humanos mas n o a de um bloque militar
7964951 ir obrigada a recordar lhe o suposto sentido da medida hora de usar a for a contra o povo e ex rcito da s rvia quando os benef cios democr ticos se levavam mediante a destrui o dos cidades s rvios bombardeiros de belgrado liquida o de pontos e outras infra estruturas do pa s
7964952 sesuai yang pernah saya dengar praktek ini tidak boleh dilakukan
7964953 hai orang orang yang beriman bertaqwalah kepada allah dan tinggalkan sisa riba yang belum dipungut jika kamu orang orang yang beriman oleh karena itu jika kamu tidak mengerjakan meninggalkan sisa riba maka ketahuilah allah dan rasul nya akan memerangi kalian
7964954 syeikh pada prakteknya dalam pasar modal ada jual beli saham harian day trading seseorang beli saham perusahaan tertentu dengan harga sekian kemudian jika harga saham tersebut naik setelah beberapa saat menit jam si pembeli tadi lantas menjualnya di sore hari pada hari yang sama apakah yang demikian diperbolehkan
7964955 boleh sebagaimana hal ini juga pernah terjadi pada zaman nabi dimana ada seseorang yang membeli kambing kemudian menjualnya kembali pada hari yang sama kepada orang lain dengan harga yang lebih tinggi nabi shalallohu alaihi wa sallam tidak melarangnya
7964956 so this guy walks into a sandwich shop and says to the guy behind the counter make me a sandwich

7964958 today i was so happy to get a job at last to feed my wife and two kids
7964959 i used to work as a day laborer in construction but theres no construction in the area and its hard to find work
7964960 we will not abandon our work if we do so we will abandon our honor as well because al qaida would take full control over our area

7964970 pour contrer cette d rive il faut commencer par ma triser lexpansion d mographique et diminuer notre surconsommation des ressources naturelles dont une bonne part sert assouvir des go ts superflus et non des besoins fondamentaux
7964971 evolutionists are as dangerous and evil as nazis quick brand them and put them in concentration camps so they dont infect our culture
7964972 trying to explain to kids what fayetteville manlius is all about or where vestal or new hartford are located is different than when you mention were going to go play west irondequoit
7964973 our kids will know some of those kids we see them in scouting theres just some natural excitement because youre playing some local schools
7964974 we think well be way more prepared for sectionals now
7964975 canandaigua beat us the last two years so it would have been the last chance for us seniors to get the job done
7964976 but we know we have a tough schedule anyway this year
7964977 i think the leagues are very comparable especially when you look at how the finger lakes teams do in sectionals
7964978 some of the best pitchers in section v have come out of the finger lakes but there is more status being in monroe county
7964979 im very excited winning games 6 0 and 7 0 in the finger lakes league didnt help us
7964980 just like we do in the classroom we want to offer the best competition we can and with the route our school is going with increasing enrollment this is a great move
7964981 followed one of the rare 90s documentaries to crack a million at the box office making it a then rare popular documentary sensation
7964982 i would not be interested in doing a documentary again because you lose sense of your personal life
7964983 i thought it seemed strangely appropriate when you look at the pool its interesting to look at these four films and see how they might have led up to that
7964984 for me when im done with one project ill always look at what seems the most interesting thing to work on next after american movie it just happened to be that home movie and the yes men both came up and they both seemed more interesting and viable than what i was working on from a narrative perspective
7964985 i never meant to go away from narrative when i started it was sort of an accident
7964986 right now im looking at a lot of different narrative projects so im hoping to stay in that world
7964987 everything requires permission but the whole country seems to run in its own sort of way
7964988 theres a lot of bureaucracy when it comes to permissions and it comes down to having the right sort of production manager and location manager and their connections to be able to make things happen within the government my producer had a production manager that was local and he knew how the system worked and he had a location manager sort of like a local thug
7964989 we couldnt pay him comparably we had already shot half the movie kate noble producer saw his photograph in the paper and thought this is the guy we were going to bombay anyway for a camera problem so we talked to ayesha mohan co star who had just done a film with a director named anurag kashyap anurag was able to get us a meeting with nana the strange thing was the first thing he said when he met us was im not going to do your film but im curious why youd think i would do your film and what youre doing with this film he started the meeting the way he is in the film a very tense and intimidating character but after talking to him for an hour and explaining to him what we were trying to do he wanted to see what we had shot after seeing it he said he would do the film i think the idea seemed so preposterous that this small group of street kids would even think he would be interested that he was curious about it
7964990 i definitely agree with that on the films ive been making it seems to take two to three years
7964991 a story of the victims of child abuse and the pain it visits upon their later lives stars brittany snow and josh janowicz and has screened at several prominent film festivals including the austin film festival the avignon film festival ft
7964992 actually getting a story from an idea to finished movie is a long and arduous journey for any filmmaker but to then make that movie available to as many people as possible is an entirely new journey altogether
7964993 i knew that i wanted to push into new online marketing models with some creative content but to get the user experience i wanted would have cost upwards of 15 000 a month from what the cdn players were asking
7964994 by leveraging the sdn with all of its built in media services such as audio and video transcoding studios such as doom inc can afford to grow and scale from their first award winning film to a limitless sky while maintaining their creative freedoms
7964995 we learned from the evolution debate that some legislators dont believe in dinosaurs
7964996 i will tell you they created a dinosaur with their energy policy
7964997 the only way anyone would ever know to attack me is if i were standing next to the highway patrol
7964998 people are getting used to the idea that theres more to a phone than talking
7964999 this is a historic day for hp and eds and for the clients we serve

7965002 clients will benefit from the combined scale and strength of our companies as they transform their technology environments
7965003 this is an important step forward in our ability to help them solve their challenges through practical innovations that deliver valuable business outcomes
7965004 we chose appgeo because we thought they were the best prepared to guide us through a participatory approach
7965005 we are looking to gather information and insights from as broad a group of stakeholders as possible to help set the future direction for higicc
7965006 a key objective of this project is to better define the most advantageous role for a coordinating body such as higicc
7965007 the facilitated workshops will enable all stakeholders from hawaii to contribute to this definition and to explore ways for productive collaboration to enhance statewide gis
7965008 we have designed and gone on to implement a gis strategic and business planning process that is flexible participatory and stakeholder focused
7965009 we have found the template driven process useful for helping states to overcome a variety of common obstacles such as coordination governance funding data exchange data development or system architecture
7965010 our goal with these new mobile services is to give quickbooks online users the edge they need to compete and manage their busy lives by keeping tabs on their business even when they are out of the office

7965019 sultan brunei sultan hassanal bolkiah dan saya telah bersetuju supaya majlis atau acara menandatangani surat itu akan dilakukan sama ada di bandar seri begawan atau di mana mana negeri di malaysia
7965020 pada pendapat saya lebih baik kalau tidak di bandar seri begawan kita sedia jadi tuan rumah untuk majlis menandatangani surat persetujuan bersama itu
7965021 kalau kita sudah tandatangani nanti ia menjadi tanda bahawa perkara perkara yang dibincangkan telah mendapat persetujuan bersama dan bolehlah kita katakan selesai
7965022 kalau ada apa apa lagi tindakan yang diambil untuk mengadakan perjanjian persempadanan ia hanyalah satu formaliti sahaja supaya tidak ada kekeliruan terhadap apa yang diputuskan
7965023 isu sempadan di darat adalah berkaitan sarawak manakala di sabah tidak ada isu sempadan yang menimbulkan masalah antara malaysia dan brunei
7965024 ia bergantung kepada apa yang dipersetujui kalau boleh bolehlah kalau tak boleh maka tak bolehlah
7965025 baginda telah menyatakan keinginan untuk mempertimbangkan peluang yang ada bagi pelaburan di kawasan itu dan insya allah apa yang kita lihat nanti adalah menjadi harapan saya bahawa baginda dapat mempertimbangkan tindakan tindakan lanjut daripada segi pelaburan
7965026 pasport yang dilengkapkan dengan teknologi rfi hanya boleh diakses dan diketahui oleh pihak imigresen melalui alat khas yang digunakan
7965027 inilah perancangan kita bagi meningkatkan lagi ciri ciri keselamatan sedia ada
7965028 namun sekiranya mereka menggunakan pasport palsu untuk keluar atau masuk ke malaysia memang kita boleh kesan
7965029 walaupun tidak dapat kesan di mana ia dipalsukan kita mempunyai unit forensik di setiap pintu masuk negara dan saya yakin tidak akan berlaku ketirisan atau kelemahan di kalangan anggota dalam mengesan dokumen palsu

7965061 i am a massive fan of pop music and have been for years
7965062 i loved the songs from the 60s and the work of writers like gerry goffin and carole king burt bacharach and hal david david and holland dozier holland i also like most pop music since right through the 70s and 80s with writers like todd rundgren and nicky chinn and mike chapman and bands like xtc and blondie up to the present day with bands like the shins to think about all that great body of work and then consider that i am part of the 1 000th record to be no 1 in the american chart feels fantastic
7965063 it feels to me like a real song of the moment here and now in the summer of 2008 its a bit controversial and makes people think which is probably a good thing katy perry is an original the video is funny and engaging and though its always a bit of a shock to hear that you have a no 1 record in the states and that youve sold a million downloads i always felt that the blend of the song and the artist was so strong that we stood a good chance of having a hit katy is super talented and i couldnt be happier for her as she also works her arse off i cant wait to get in the studio with her again

7965218 more and more it seems like hes taking his cues from barack obama
7965219 i dont think this is the property of the bush administration or sen mccain
7965220 we in the obama campaign have very much supported that counterinsurgency doctrine
7965221 we just need an administration thats prepared to follow through
7965222 its particularly wonderful to answer your questions without a gavel in your hand
7965223 the evenness of temperament to contrast with what ill call the other candidate
7965224 john mccain is well known for his ability to lose it
7965225 so inconsistent with american values but also american interests in pakistan
7965226 but we can very strongly make evident what we support and what needs to change to get our support
7965227 i think also there is a role for force and senator obama has been clear about this
7965228 we have to be honest in saying we have some values that are at play there
7965229 there are very delicate lines to be drawn and need to recognize only in extremely important circumstances
7965230 i dont think the range of targets can be very great

7965233 the idea of buying group gifts is nothing new plenty of people do it already the main problem today is that there is no good or easy solution for making sure that everybody knows what they are contributing toward plus there is no hassle free method for the organizer to collect everybodys contribution
7965234 with wisheo the organizer sends out an invite to everyone with details about the gift all the contributions are monitored with wisheo and automatic reminders are sent out to participants who are late with their contributions it essentially removes the hassle of asking everyone to pay their share

7965242 weve all heard the adage that it costs more to attract a first time guest than a repeat customer
7965243 the heart and soul of this principle resides in that first time customers experience and how likely they will be to return as a result the oregon q care program raises the bar on the level of customer service provided by staff in every position of the organization helping them understand the central role they play in customer satisfaction
7965244 excellence in customer service is often the difference between success and failure in the hospitality industry
7965245 because of this the oregon restaurant association is proud to add this terrific training program to our menu of quality online training products
7965246 oregon q care allows hoteliers to train their entire staff with a consistent message and its free
7965247 if we can convince visitors to come back again and tell their friends about the oregon experience we ensure the long term success of the oregon lodging and tourism industries

7965251 in the current climate we are finding exceptional deals on distressed assets like residential land

7965260 governor edward g rendell and the general assembly have laid the foundation for pennsylvanias energy independence but we must be aware of the challenges ahead
7965261 the legislation is essential to reducing overall demand especially at peak times when rates are most expensive
7965262 pennsylvania already has established itself as a leader in the development and deployment of advanced energy solutions
7965263 weve attracted some of the worlds leading renewable energy companies and supported cutting edge businesses that are making groundbreaking advancements in these fields collectively these business large and small startup and mature have created more than 3 000 new jobs and injected more than 1 billion into our economy but we should not rest on our laurels its imperative that we act now to protect our people and our employers and mitigate the expected higher electricity rates

7965269 how many democrats does it take to lose the most winnable election in american history not many just a few close advisors to barack obama who tell him a bunch of asinine stuff and he ends up listening to them instead of his own heart
7965270 barack obama may yet recover his core focus now he has to preserve it against his most terrifying foes the experts in his own party
7965271 it is reassuring to see these results as they confirm were on the right track in highlighting our value offerings for our customers

7965274 youre a harvard student youre not supposed to become a cop thats a blue collar job
7965275 its different what i do now compared to 10 years ago
7965276 when i was 25 it was just work hard and thats it now its more about stretching and giving yourself more time to recover and you have to really think about what you are doing there is more focus on specific workouts you cant just go run hard or lift weights any way you want ive always enjoyed being in the gym and doing the work theres just more focus on specifics now to keep my body in top shape
7965277 you have to focus on rehab a little more and that also can take some more time than 10 years ago this past season was tough when i had the surgery but i had a lot of time to rehab and i didnt have to rush it and that was good i feel pretty good right now and im just preparing for the season
7965278 for so many years we lost in the first round and we were able to get over that hump we grew a lot as a team and i think a lot of individual players grew also we realize that we have the ability to go far in the playoffs and we want to do it again it was a little short of where we really wanted to be but we all realize that it is right there it was a good feeling that we could have that success but it was also disappointing because we want to go all the way but it was a good run and it gives is a lot of confidence heading into this season
7965279 i dont have a lot of specific personal goals i focus more on the team goals
7965280 thats the main thing the team if the team wins i really dont care how i play or if i score the goals especially in the playoffs winning the stanley cup is the goal and we believe we can do it there is a lot of work to do to get there but we believe the chance to win it is right there i guess i do have one personal goal though i just want to play well every night and help the team last season i was injured so health is a big goal for me i want to play every game and stay away from the injuries
7965281 it was normal stuff saw a lot of family and friends i had a couple of friends get married and we went to those weddings it was fun

7965286 the report was regrettably seen in some quarters as big business yet again being negative and failing to assist australia to address the challenge of climate change
7965287 just in case you think i am advocating a free ride for industry let me make it clear that there is nothing in the bca submission that suggests that industry should not share some of the costs associated with the introduction of emissions trading

7965331 we like to think that a childs play is unconstrained but when children appear to feel joyous and free this may merely hide from their minds their purposefulness you can see this more clearly when you attempt to drag them away from their chosen tasks for they are exploring their worlds to see whats there making explanations of what those things are and imagining what else could be exploring explaining and learning are among a childs most purposeful urges and goals the playfulness of childhood is the most demanding teacher we have never again in those childrens lives will anything drive them to work so hard

7965345 but while it was limited it was limited to influential people
7965346 secondly we know something about how the electorate is using the new media environment
7965347 meaning lots of cable channels that you have an option to go to even when youre watching traditional mainstream broadcast people arent watching 30 minutes of nbc or cbs or abc anymore theres a whole part of the electorate that is watching a segment of it it gets what it needs of politics and it starts to channel surf to find other political information and over a third of the electorate says its done that at least once or twice in this most recent viewing experience

7965403 today all of canada mourns the deaths of three brave soldiers killed in the line of duty in afghanistan
7965404 these soldiers made an important contribution to international efforts in afghanistan aimed at creating the conditions necessary for reconstruction and development efforts to flourish in a country ravaged by decades of war and despotism
7965405 canada and our nato allies are making a profound difference in the lives of the afghan people
7965406 despite this tragic event we remain undeterred in our mission to help afghans rebuild their country
7965407 the mountain is our only source of water and it regulates the regions climate
7965408 one hundred years ago this was a mining zone but that left the area neither gold nor progress just a huge environmental debt
7965409 we are the only province which practically has no rivers water means everything for us
7965410 i dont understand people who say we are going to pollute
7965411 i dont know of a single case of people who have died of this famous pollution they are trying to scare people but we arent going to bring this to a halt
7965412 the 2007 laws were never codified and implemented so two new ones were passed one that designates the secretariat of the environment as the regulatory authority for the mining industry and another that create a consultative council
7965413 we are not opposed to mining what we want is responsible mining
7965414 polluting the water would be a crime in a province without rivers where virtually all of the water consumed has to be extracted from underground sources
7965415 mining activity from the period when la mexicana was active in the area left tremendously acid drainage at the headwaters and we ourselves never saw any of the gold
7965416 since the laws against open cast mining were overturned we have been in a state of permanent assembly
7965417 i believe the best forum for voters to see the candidates in their work clothes is in a debate

7965430 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and it is unfortunate that warner bros has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7965460 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners in the west

7965479 ci aspettiamo tutti di vedere a presto una soluzione definitiva di altissima qualit che giustifichi il prezzo ma davvero non si poteva prevedere che una distesa di tali dimensioni necessitasse di giunti adeguati per impedire che le pietre si sollevino e si rompano come successo in altre piazze della regione

7965481 the department of athletics joined the university in the scarlet gray amp green sustainability campaign a year ago at ohio stadium in an effort to be a campus leader in recycling at ohio state
7965482 in doing so we were able to keep nearly 120 tons of waste from ohio landfills last year we hope buckeye fans will again help us reach this goal in 2008
7965483 we are all extremely excited for the future of ohio state volleyball
7965484 one of our goals is to create an event at our volleyball matches that fans will connect to and fall in love with we know that once a person comes to an ohio state volleyball match they will be hooked
7965485 this team has grown a great deal and they are ready to battle this season
7965486 we have solid leadership and a strong team dynamic they have worked hard set some amazing goals and met the challenges we have put in front of them with passion that is a solid foundation to do great things
7965487 it essentially is a mock game and will serve mainly as a dry run for us
7965488 we will go through all of our pre game rituals from the team meal the warm ups and the locker room chats we want to make it as real as possible so the team gets an idea of how the entire season will go
7965489 they have grown a lot as a team and things are looking good we have come a long way since august 9 but there is still a lot of room for improvement the team is working very hard playing together nicely and building great team dynamics
7965490 the team is tired of playing each other so we are all excited to see an actual opponent we have three very different teams coming in and this will be a great learning experience for the team on how to shift gears and be competitive against different opponents it will be good preparation and will lay down foundations for us for the upcoming big ten season
7965491 we changed out the pipes at the harley shop yeah thats true so was it illegal for them to do it
7965492 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
7965493 are we supposed to get up at 5 30 or is this another senior prank on me
7965494 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
7965495 as i understand it that plan could get de railed at the rnc ritchie said
7965496 but the chairs of the rules committees of both parties are calling for primaries and caucuses to be held on later dates
7965497 if youve got 100 people in a room you can still hold a meaningful caucus said melendez
7965498 but if youve got 1 000 people thats not a caucus
7965499 a lot of people like me are pushing for the party to make change said nancy larson a member of the democratic national committee and a minnesota superdelegate at the convention here
7965500 i thought it was a good opportunity for people to see that real people were involved in the process here i was this woman from rural minnesota many of us in the dnc are just people we dont have money we dont have power we just care
7965501 when you get right down to it people talk about how they want change but most really dont like change she said
7965502 they end up saying oh the system we have isnt perfect but at least we understand it
7965503 because of how simple they look people hypothesized that trichoplax represented an early form of animal life other people thought they were just simplified cnidarians jellyfish and hydras
7965504 we wanted to figure out where they fit with other animals in particular the cnidarians the sponges and more complex animals
7965505 comparing its genome with other genomes can tell us what the basic molecular toolkit was in the common ancestor of all animals
7965506 if you want to understand the early origin and diversification of animals you have to infer this from the fossil record or the genome sequences of animals that lived and diverged early most of which didnt leave fossils
7965507 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
7965508 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature
7965509 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
7965510 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
7965511 it can make a gut as needed so it could be the original proto animal
7965512 the reason so many people misunderstand so many issues is not that these issues are so complex but that people do not want a factual or analytical explanation that leaves them emotionally unsatisfied they want villains to hate and heroes to cheer and they dont want explanations that do not give them that
7965513 when we hear about rent control or gun control we may think about rent or guns but the word that really matters is
7965514 its good to be back here again and i am really excited to start the season here in oklahoma and around the nation on thursday like everyone this time of year after a long pre season our players are anxious to start the season they just get tired of going up against each other every day and now we finally get to face another team here at home this weekend hopefully we can start the season in a positive sharp way eliminate penalties and turnovers and just play smart i am excited to be starting at home this weekend and we are looking forward to starting the year
7965515 well we lost a few guys but mike knall is back punting the ball for us derek shaw has had an achilles injury and we have had a couple of young guys ben hampton and james winchester come in and snap the ball well jimmy stevens has been kicking the ball well he has been really good and consistent and solid and i have really been pleased with his play then there are others guys in matt moreland and tress way that have a little bit bigger legs than jimmy but jimmy is really good from 50 yards in carter whitson is going to be replacing hays mceachern holding for kicks and he has been very solid through camp as well
7965516 there is always competition beginning with sam proctor at safety if he keeps coming on like he has been he has a chance to get up there with lendy holmes some other guys have been looking good and solid but they way they play on saturday will dictate a lot
7965517 we expect a lot from them we expect them to be very physical and pressure the quarterback without having to blitz the whole time we will definitely challenge those guys to play to the level we know they are capable of
7965518 he is healthy he made it through all of our practices and i think for him and for everyone the weekend off allowed them to come back ready to go for game week
7965519 some of the rules will be interesting to see how everything works for example when the ball goes out of bounds and the second the ball is spotted they will start the clock i think that will speed things up i think more than anything though that you will see a more consistent pace of play i think the ball will be spotted quicker too which will allow the offense to dictate when they want to snap the ball its going to be a little different but i think you will just see a more consistent pace of play more than anything
7965520 that is one thing that i did work on in the off season coach heupel came up with a couple of drills to emphasize that and we spent some extra time with some wide receivers during spring ball working on that i think that my arm seems a little bit stronger so i feel that i am able to put a little bit more air on the ball and still get it there
7965521 it really is a great honor to be voted by your teammates to be a captain and it is something that just adds to the experience and it is something that i really didnt think was going to happen this year i tried to be more vocal and i tried to step up and its something that i wanted to be but i still felt it was something that i had a ways to go i guess they saw it in me and they feel comfortable with me as a captain it is a big honor
7965522 our wide receiver core is very versatile they can play almost anywhere we want them to play and i think that is really going to be a benefit to us teams that scout us are going to have a hard time because we can put our guys in different formations and in different areas that it will be hard to key in on one guy and where he is located i think it will just add to our offense the versatility and the ability we have to create new plays each week
7965523 obviously i feel more comfortable with the offense with the things we are doing but another thing is i feel more prepared i know what to expect from game week i have been there i know what it takes to get prepared and know what it takes to get our team prepared i think that is one of the things that will really help our team this year
7965524 its a bit difficult to believe that confidence will improve further if the job market continues to weaken
7965525 as with yesterdays mondays report on existing home sales the data indicates that lower prices are beginning to attract buyers nonetheless currency valuations are being driven to a large degree by commodities especially oil along with u s stock markets oil declined during trading in europe and the dollar advanced but oil prices have since gone up as traders speculate hurricane gustav may disrupt supplies from the gulf of mexico we can expect to see oil prices come right back down again if the storm passes without causing damage especially since demand is projected to slow further as the economy cools in the second half of the year

7965534 the evidential test has not been passed and it would be simply wrong to bring the prosecution
7965535 i realise that this decision will come as a disappointment to the complainants in the case and possibly to others who have made statements to the police or are considering doing so
7965536 i am obviously aware that assertions have been made without any basis or foundation that justice will not be done in the child abuse investigations that are taking place
7965537 indeed it is for that reason that i am making this full statement as to why a decision not to prosecute has been taken in this case
7965538 all those who have any relevant evidence to give in the current child abuse investigation to contact the police and to make statements
7965539 that is the only way the prosecution will be able to reach a fully informed decision on the evidential test in the various cases that come before us for consideration
7965540 if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
7965541 but government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help
7965542 it was always going to be tough but i didnt expect a 5 1
7965543 although it was 5 1 there were three frames decided on the black ball so winning them was massive

7965545 ive not had the heart going like that for a while you never forget it but when it comes back its quite scary you realise youre under some pressure

7965602 there are two hundred and fifty six names given in the bible for the lord jesus christ and i suppose this was because he was infinitely beyond all that any one name could express
7965603 blessed are you simon son of jonah for this was not revealed to you by man but by my father in heaven and i tell you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not overcome it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
7965604 a man who was merely a man and said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg or he would be the devil of hell you must take your choice either this was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse you can shut him up for a fool or you can fall at his feet and call him lord and god but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us

7965611 my sons anxiety disappeared and his sweet loving behavior returned he shows no signs of being under the influence of a drug he now receives one marijuana brownie and several doses of marinol which contains the active ingredient in marijuana each day this has clearly saved my childs life and my familys life
7965612 i know its not the end all answer but its been the best answer for the longest time for us in comparison to all the other medications i cannot tell you how many months we would go on a medication wondering if it was doing anything anything at all here we can see the difference in 30 to 60 minutes
7965613 my son who is almost nine years old has been on medications to address his severe autistic behaviors none of the medications has ever made a difference except for making his behaviors worse a few months ago we tried the prescription drug marinol and noticed a drop in the severe episodes no fits and little to no aggression toward his teacher and family members on a daily basis a few weeks ago we started him on cannabis and stopped the marinol he has been in a much better mood and is much easier to keep on task in the classroom now he still has days when he gets angry and moody but we can adjust the dose to help him through those days i feel much more comfortable administering cannabis than something like risperdal
7965614 i firmly believe that if the whole materia medica could be sunk to the bottom of the sea it would all the better for mankind and all the worse for the fishes

7965625 i think you are doing a great job here you have been working really hard you have had good services and good sermons i really enjoyed todays sermon especially i thought it was really well put together and flowed nicely i loved the connotations that we as non jews are the gentiles of the world and we should be thankful that jesus opened his grace up to us the only thing i have to say is i am not sure what it had to do with your sermon title the only thing i can think of is that should proofread the bulletin a little closer next time chin up bob chin up you are doing a good job keep working hard and it will pay off
7965626 if peter had not taken the risk he would never have learnt the meaning of faith before he can believe the utterly impossible and ethically irresponsible situation on the waves of the sea must be displayed the road to faith passes through obedience to the call of jesus unless a definite step is demanded the call vanishes into thin air and if men imagine that they can follow jesus without taking this step they are deluding themselves like fanatics for faith is only real when there is obedience never without it and faith only becomes faith in the act of obedience

7965632 worshipped him saying truly you are the son of god
7965633 before he can believe the utterly impossible and ethically irresponsible situation on the waves of the sea must be displayed
7965634 its not the first time jesus has called his disciples to do something that seems impossible hes already called his disciples to turn the other cheek if somebody walks up to them and clocks them in the face hes already called his disciples to walk two miles if anybody asks them to walk one hes already called his disciples to love their enemies and pray for those who persecute them hes already called his disciples to be perfect just like their father in heaven is perfect he has already called his disciples to cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers and cast out demons hes already called his disciples to follow him wherever he goes even to the cross so it shouldnt come as a surprise when jesus honors peters request and again calls him to do the impossible okay peter come to me walk on water

7965657 maybe if the live action star wars tv series goes ahead i might try and wheedle my way back into the affections of lucasfilm and write an episode
7965658 the weird thing and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
7965659 doctor who is like that as well and because of the nature of how doctor who evolves you become part of that tradition rather than a re handling of it
7965660 both of those are perfect examples of taking the spirit of the original material and entirely maintaining it
7965661 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again
7965662 a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
7965663 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7965664 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic

7965807 sejak naiknya harga gas itu seperti terjadi pembiaran terhadap masyarakat miskin yang dibuat bingung sendiri dan tanpa daya mau mengadu ke mana padahal baru beberapa saat masyarakat meninggalkan minyak tanah mitan dan diwajibkan gunakan elpiji baru menyesuaikan tau tau harganya sudah dinaikkan lagi
7965808 sudah naik harganya susah lagi nyari nya bagaimana kalau rakyat kembali tuntut lagi ke minyak tanah ini kan repot makanya pemerintah perlu serius menangani masalah ini jangan sampai timbul praduga kenaikan harga hanya akal akalan untuk persiapan kebutuhan pemilu 2009
7965809 benar sekali itu padahal kebijakan elpiji katanya untuk menolong rakyat dengan harga yang memadai dan dengan alasan subsidi masih besar sekarang kemudian dibebankan kepada rakyat dan hukum pasar yang kemudian pemerintah tidak mampu mengatasinya
7965810 sekarang kan beban kehidupan ekonomi rakyat sehari hari di mana mana kian berat karenanya perlu kebijakan yang pro rakyat itu bukan semakin hari ada peningkatan harga dengan alasan hukum pasar dan sebagainya
7965811 memang khusus elpiji 12 kg tidak diatur dalam kebijakan atau tak disubsidi tapi kan ini kenaikan akan menggiring masyarakat ke elpiji tiga kg yang disubsidi

7965844 though not popular in many areas of the u s road tolls are a common part of daily life in many eastern cities and in cities around the globe according to a new study by researchers at two california universities the age old question of whether tolls are more equitable than taxes has been answered and tolls are the way to go they say based on a study of a 10 mile 16km stretch of the 91 express lanes tollway which features four lanes for the exclusive use of drivers pre registered with transponders the charges to use the reserved lanes are variable and based on demand and time of day while the remaining lanes are free by comparing the usage patterns with income levels and correlating that with the effects of tax or toll based revenue generation on income the study came to its conclusion the reason tolls are more equitable is that they impact poor less harshly than taxes because transport projects must be funded theres no way to avoid needing either tolls or taxes but the study bolsters the idea that usage based payment is fairer than sales tax based payment because flat rate taxes form a larger portion of the total income for the poor compared to the wealthy whereas the wealthier road uses are the predominant express lane users according to study data reports green car congress historically flat rate charges such as sales taxes and road tolls have both been subject to the same criticism of regressiveness or having a heavier impact on the poor than the wealthy proponents of the studys findings however think that in this case the toll is less regressive since it is use based whereas the tax impacts the poor regardless of whether they own or drive cars

7965984 she really rallied and was sitting up in bed talking to people that was the best day weve had
7965985 i had asked her if she wanted to vote and she said yes i really would like to vote for hillary
7965986 so i filled out the papers she signed them and i went to the courthouse and got the ballot
7965987 then i got mother her glasses and she sat up she was very alert very serious in studying the ballot
7965988 and when she marked it she just kept circling and circling that mark with her pencil i thought she was going to mark a hole in it
7965989 im so flattered to have the support of florence and so many like her
7965990 i have met so many women from my mothers generation who come up to me and say they were born before women could vote and now want to see a woman in the white house
7965991 they called my husband and said the president wanted to meet us
7965992 he said he was really sorry and he understood our loss he really appreciated that my mom had made an effort to get out and vote for hillary by absentee ballot he has great respect for women of my mothers generation
7965993 i suppose everyone who is losing their mother thinks the same thing she was always there
7965994 she taught me to excel in everything i did she always wanted my daughter and me to be able to take care of ourselves and have an assertive role in our own lives
7965995 i think there are a lot of similarities between them
7965996 my mother certainly doesnt have the wealth or notoriety or reputation but shes been a survivor just like hillary and whether you like her clinton or not shes a survivor you have to respect her for that

7966021 finally people are interested in what ive been trying to explain to them for the past 27 years
7966022 ever since i was little my parents knew there was something a bit different about me and growing up in the states they didnt exactly know where to put me because i wasnt autistic i didnt have cerebral palsy i was failing every subject and students and teachers were bullying me
7966023 something as simplistic as getting dressed in the morning was quite difficult so id show up to class late
7966024 and i remember when i was 7 i put my jeans on in the wrong direction inside out
7966025 imagine having problems with depth perception and trying to do geometry or lining up numbers
7966026 i cant judge which way the arrows should go and which way it should go in
7966027 these are not children who are just low in athletic ability
7966028 they are children who are having difficulty with everyday activities like buttering bread turning a key in the lock printing cutting combing their hair just doing everyday activities
7966029 its helpful to families when they recognize that their children are struggling to know that the children are not going to get worse that its not a degenerative condition
7966030 in fact the children are going to develop some skills over time and therefore they will seem better
7966031 if people realize how hard it is for them to do the motor aspect of tasks and they understand it theres lots of ways around many tasks
7966032 nothings missing with us we have talents things are just a bit off
7966033 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
7966034 its one thing to still be doing it but to still have your records played on the radio and to have contemporary success thats whats exciting
7966035 radio has said to me in so many words if you do great work well play it but if its average youll have to stand in line
7966036 ive always been a country singer with a lot of influences
7966037 and i think thats helped me because i can do a variety of songs
7966038 we dont work with youth at risk but rather the jrb is an early intervention prevention program
7966039 all of our kids made a mistake a bad choice these are all minor minor things some things that some of us may have done in the past when we were growing up but it wasnt such a big deal back then
7966040 we spend every waking moment in that camp carving out leadership skills in every kid thats there
7966041 as a gun and gang violence prevention retreat and i put it on the flyer so there was no mistake about what we were doing
7966042 its always a good idea to send youth on different explorations to expand their minds
7966043 and i also liked having young males with older males like a mentoring situation thats important for their development
7966044 what it really is about is to show the young men theres other stuff to do besides hanging with your friends and being with boys that want to shoot or sell drugs
7966045 who feel like some of these children are headed down a path that is going to lead them toward jail and they feel this program is an intervention to prevent that

7966066 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7966067 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation

7966069 seen as potentially exacerbating the contraction in the housing sector
7966070 this gives us an opportunity to get a competitive advantage in terms of what we can offer that other people cant

7966074 we saw a great opportunity for folks to interact and have a little bit of fun with the koodo brand
7966075 we were excited to lend an element of interactivity and engagement to what can otherwise be a fairly sleepy part of ones daily routine
7966076 its an exciting time to join ford of canada as we accelerate plans to introduce new fuel efficient vehicles especially small cars and crossovers which are exactly what canadian consumers are asking for
7966077 i look forward to working closely with the ford of canada dealers to ensure we are not only meeting but exceeding customer expectations as we introduce the new products
7966078 usually even a non christian knows something about the earth the heavens and the other elements of this world about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon the cycles of the years and seasons about the kinds of animals shrubs stones and so forth and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from and experience now it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a christian presumably giving the meaning of holy scripture talking nonsense on these topics and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation in which people show up vast ignorance in a christian and laugh it to scorn but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions and to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil the writers of our scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by these who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books for then they will try to call upon holy scripture for proof and even recite from memory many passages which they think support their position although they understand neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertion
7966079 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7966080 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
7966081 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7966082 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
7966083 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
7966084 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7966085 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
7966086 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
7966087 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
7966088 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7966089 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7966090 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7966091 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
7966092 god thank you for what you have done for me i believe you sent jesus to die for my sins i believe jesus rose again to give me everlasting life please forgive me for the wrong things i have done please give me a new and clean heart i invite you into my life teach me to do everything you want me to do and to follow you all the days of my life i pray this believing in what jesus did for me amen

7966100 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign

7966103 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7966104 in just 12 months this economic landslide has sent the consumer lending market into disarray

7966152 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
7966153 it leads all of us the international community to question russias commitment to its word
7966154 and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interest to take these kinds of actions
7966155 it will be dead on arrival at the un security council

7966158 did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability due to the effects of financial market strains as well as macroeconomic risks
7966159 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic and financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
7966160 participants expressed significant concerns about the upside risks to inflation especially the risk that persistently high headline inflation could result in an unmooring of long run inflation expectations
7966161 some viewed the upside risks to inflation as having diminished modestly over the intermeeting period mainly as a result of the drop in the prices of oil and some other commodities as well as the greater likelihood of persistent economic slack however others viewed these risks as having increased a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets

7966174 id like to get rid of this old notion of old media i want to be in the hip happening new media thats the way we think of ourselves whats changed is the tools its engaging a generation in a whole new way i see old people on facebook and young people on the good old dead tree edition its adding lots and lots of new voices
7966175 we have a much broader audience on the web we have about 30 million people online this week has about 3 million and the evening news has eight or nine million the audience that we reach on the web is very different from the ones that watch the evening news or my show its a constant struggle to figure out who youre talking to if you try to push of the new media on people it turns off the people used to the old ways you have to bring them along slowly
7966176 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
7966177 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
7966178 it seems to me everyone in the world should be obsessed with this
7966179 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps

7966183 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7966184 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7966185 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7966186 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
7966187 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time

7966209 an attempt to extract further concessions from american officials less than a week after both sides said they had agreed to remove all u s combat troops by the end of 2011 if the security situation remained relatively stable but leave other american forces in place
7966210 had agreed to withdraw all troops not just combat brigades as part of a security accord governing u s forces in iraq and that the withdrawal schedule must be firm
7966211 american officials said no accord had been reached and insisted that any withdrawal be based on conditions at the time

7966217 it was purposefully done on a day that most democratic elected officials in illinois were out of town i think the reception here will not be warm
7966218 its somewhat petty to pick that particular day to try and take away attention
7966219 he was trying in some desperate way to make himself seem somewhat relevant hes not wanted here
7966220 well why would that surprise you he still denies hes public official a
7966221 i think this week the unity and the common purpose we have of electing barack obama is overwhelming so i feel very confident that the illinois democrats are going to be united this week and throughout the election season
7966222 there are different people among democrats but as we move to the general election were all being to be brought together and were all going to working for the same direction which is to change the direction of this country

7966226 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7966227 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7966228 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7966229 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7966230 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7966231 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7966232 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7966233 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7966234 we know from previous research that the uninsured have poor outcomes on a number of measures and they are less likely to seek care when they need it
7966235 but we know less about what actually happens when the uninsured try to obtain health care in various settings and more specifically how institutions deal with these patients
7966236 we found that the public institution was the most open to seeing patients in a variety of settings by contrast the for profit institution would really only see patients in the emergency department
7966237 the for profit basically took its losses and seemed to say well just see these folks in the emergency department we wont work too hard to get money from them and so be it
7966238 and not surprisingly the not for profit fell in between
7966239 as we move forward in the political process we have to recognize that this is essentially an unmanaged group a group of people who dont know what theyre going to get they are getting care from a set of institutions that are uncomfortable and unsure about what it is they want to provide
7966240 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7966241 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7966242 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7966243 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so

7966245 an increase in water temperature of just a couple degrees celsius results in visible damage to adult corals and their offspring
7966246 corals are most vulnerable when they are very small and our protected nursery will help them to get through the first critical days
7966247 poachers often collect wild corals to satisfy the demand for aquariums but aquarium professionals are looking for alternative less destructive sources of these animals secores goal is to develop methods to eventually breed corals in captivity thereby reducing some of the pressure to collect corals from the wild
7966248 we are starting by raising juveniles from wild caught eggs and sperm which enables us to provide aquariums with the corals they desire without damaging wild adult colonies in return the aquarium operators help us to perform the experiments and give us tips on how to raise adult corals in captivity which is something they are very good at

7966294 the overall growth rate associated with the network branded prepaid market has slowed somewhat but still grew by 44 5 from 26 8 billion in 2006 to 38 7b in 2007 while this represents an enviable growth rate by almost any external standard it will likely still disappoint an industry that has come to expect triple digit growth rates this slowdown in growth rate should not be surprising since the increase in total market dollar value simply makes triple digit growth rates increasingly difficult to achieve the 11 9b increase for the open loop load is a very healthy increase in market size some of the market segments that are most hard pressed to maintain triple digit or higher growth rates include state unemployment and court ordered payments these segments were growing rapidly as each of the larges states adopted prepaid and rolled it out but once that is achieved for the largest states the addition of each smaller state represents a smaller percentage of the total

7966311 tonight we come to the end of sixteen glorious days which we will cherish forever through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7966312 in all my decades at the post this is the first event ive covered at which i was certain that the main point of the exercise was to co opt the western media including nbc with a splendidly pretty sparsely attended completely controlled sports event inside a quasi military compound we had little alternative but to be a conduit for happy olympics progressive china propaganda i suspect it worked
7966313 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7966333 the picture is becoming clear not only are vaccines causing an epidemic of autoimmunity including type 1 diabetes but they are causing an epidemic of metabolic syndrome as the immune system acts to suppress the inflammation and autoimmunity caused by the vaccines current data shows that vaccines are much more dangerous than the public is lead to believe and adequate testing has never been performed even in healthy subjects the current practice of vaccinating diabetics as well as their close family members is a very risky practice

7966336 these data reflect the hard work of our students parents teachers and administrators
7966337 for me it was the key moment of the race i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error but first of all i can not understand why the stewards made their decision only after the race
7966338 they have all the information that is needed to make a judgement during the grand prix
7966339 i think the organisers did a great job getting it ready and i can really see valencia growing into a great track it certainly wasnt your average street circuit it was very flat wide and fast so almost the complete opposite of monaco
7966340 youve got to be more committed than at a normal circuit to get the maximum from the car but at the same time youve also got to be more cautious because you know that even the slightest error can put you in the wall so youve got to blend those two approaches obviously were not throwing the cars right into the corners where the apexes are marked by concrete barriers but i try to get as close as possible as push as close to the limit as i can while remaining safe
7966341 the most difficult thing about the track was its dustiness it was very slippery so if you locked your brakes you could find yourself sliding quite a bit as i found out on a couple of occasions
7966342 but i love the concept of racing in the streets of a city monaco has always felt special and valencia also had a unique feel to it now im looking forward to singapore at the end of september these kind of races really makes formula 1 exciting
7966343 well obviously were pretty limited by what we can change during the race itself we can alter the tyre pressures and change the angle of the front wing flap but thats about it during free practice we can make further set up changes but its still important not to make too many hasty calls at a circuit like valencia which was very green and dusty on the opening day its particularly important not to change too much as the track conditions will change hugely before the race we usually find a good balance before we arrive at a track and then my job is all about making detail changes with my engineers to optimise the balance and look after tyre wear
7966344 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move in valencia we scored a very useful haul of points and ive actually come away from the weekend having extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe im mentally strong enough to be able to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game

7966350 this may not seem significant to the average user but in reality this is likely to increase the costs for small and medium sized service providers due to the way traffic on the internet is exchanged
7966351 we are very encouraged by the outcome of the follow up analysis as it is clear from the results that xepol brings relief from pain and muscle weakness to pps patients
7966352 we are very excited about this data as currently there is no medical treatment for pps and patients in the treated group have experienced a reduction in disease symptoms after just 12 months
7966353 it is very rewarding to see that xepol is demonstrating efficacy and the potential to help pps patients
7966354 we are looking forward to expanding the xepol treatment procedure following product registration
7966355 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7966356 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7966357 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7966358 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7966359 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts
7966360 this type of infection reflects a situation in which our microbial companions have overstepped their bounds something has gone awry with this balance
7966361 we are delighted to have demonstrated the effectiveness of nsl 101 this exciting new treatment has many over the counter applications
7966362 there are significant commercial opportunities for new additions to toothpastes ulcer gels toothache remedies as well as creams and ointments for stings and grazes nsl 101 may also have future commercial applications following minor cosmetic procedures nsl 101 is an opportunity to differentiate our products from those of our competitors and these new data could well provide us with a significant commercial advantage furthermore the results from the periodontitis trial demonstrate our ability to identify treatments that work in the clinic

7966365 it was good and it was nice to be able to spend some time with the family the f1 calendar might not be as packed as nascar but it is still pretty busy because our season is more compact and you have the testing programme to concentrate on between races with the august testing ban we took the opportunity to go across to the us i didnt go to any races but we did actually spend a day with juan pablo montoya and his family in miami it was nice to spend some time together away from the race track instead of being in the paddock it was great to be on the beach with our wives
7966366 i think they did a good job and it is a great new venue for formula 1 it is always nice when you have a race in the middle of a city the atmosphere was nice and this years race was extra special because it was the first one
7966367 it was not what you would call a typical street circuit with slow average speeds the race winning average was 193km h and there was more run off than normal at a street track i was expecting that there would be some incidents in the race but in fact we got through without any safety car appearances which was unexpected
7966368 yes it was a strong performance by the whole team the weekend didnt start well for me on the friday because i wasnt happy with the car balance you always have to be extra careful on a street circuit especially a new one because there is a lot of dust and a lack of grip on the first day i learn circuits quickly so that was no problem but the track does come to you even more when the tyre rubber goes down you notice that a lot in monaco and i was expecting the same i changed quite a bit for saturday morning but didnt have the opportunity to evaluate the car in final practice
7966369 there was an issue with the gearbox oil pump we replaced it twice and then it broke down again so we changed some of the ancillaries as well it basically meant that i missed out on saturday morning free practice and went into qualifying blind
7966370 it was a nice surprise because i didnt know what to expect if im honest i found the car much easier on lighter fuel than with a heavier load especially after missing third practice because id changed the set up completely and not tried it at all on saturday morning in qualifying i was just driving with what i had i managed to get it right in q1 and repeated the lap in q2 i did a decent lap at the start of q3 and then on my final run i was three tenths up in the first sector but made a mistake and aborted the lap the potential was maybe fifth but in the circumstances i couldnt be too unhappy
7966371 i made quite a good start so i was fighting for points straight away i was behind sebastian vettel and although i felt i could go a bit quicker there was no way to pass i didnt lose too much ground though and i went two laps longer than him in the first stint so got past in the pit stops i was able to maintain a strong pace without pushing too hard and was taking care of the tyres and the brakes so everything was good then i managed to get ahead of kimi raikkonen at his second pit stop because he was delayed that was unexpected and i thought we would have a big fight for the position until i saw him retiring fifth position was a good result considering where we started and it was particularly good to get both cars in the points
7966372 i am definitely optimistic because the team is pushing very hard

7966382 in the beginning it was about single clip videos but now the mainstream content has come online and there is an expectation for quality
7966383 one of the challenges we all have now is that the web audience has adult attention deficit disorder and moves around quickly a company that draws audience by creating a destination will win the video war
7966384 creating a virtual cycle between watching tv and online so they are complementary is the future of the industry
7966385 its very empowering for our fans to know that there are tens of thousands of people watching the show at the same time
7966386 right now we are talking about pc and tv but soon every device will have a potential for video your photo frame will stream videos from grandmas visit or broadcast the weather channel
7966387 pretty soon the idea of tv sitting in the living room will disappear
7966388 it caused me to reflect on when my kids started school
7966389 that first day was a mixed bag because if you were a mom with the kids in the house all summer you were looking forward to some peace and quiet but in the same vein it was another year gone

7966408 but i dont think anyone could beat us our team was full of hall of famers legends a number of our guys had won nba championships plus we had that mystique and thats never coming back

7966420 at this point we dont know whats wrong with it
7966421 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
7966422 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed
7966423 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
7966424 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
7966425 todays step by russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis neither for georgia nor for the rest of the world
7966426 russia has made an extraordinary strategic mistake and has badly damaged its place in modern international relations
7966427 the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to change the borders of europe by force
7966428 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
7966429 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent

7966437 i think there are some clinton supporters who are very upset over the hillary thing
7966438 i think when hillary speaks she will probably explain to them that she appreciates their support i have talked to her and told her she has my support any time in the future when she wants to do something but it isnt this time we should all support the democrat ticket for president and vice president

7966445 the who dolls i found myself in a bit of crossfire between some obama supporters and some clinton supporters yes who did happen to be women of a certain age who are each plainly still stinging from wounds experienced during the long primary
7966446 did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative
7966447 if i harbor old stuff then i cant move forward
7966448 so im just going to take it day by day
7966449 she said we have to pat you down i said you cant treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra
7966450 they tried to humiliate me and i was not going to be humiliated over this
7966451 if i was carrying nail clippers and forgot about them i wouldnt have gotten so upset but here i was just wearing my underwear
7966452 its actually a little funny in a way but a sad sad commentary on the state of our country
7966453 this is bigger than just me there are 150 million women in america and this could happen to any of them
7966454 we do everything we can to ensure that a passenger doesnt feel humiliated
7966455 they cant find bombs in checked luggage and theyre essentially doing a pat down of private parts this is a security apparatus that is out of control
7966456 i wear a toolbelt and go barefoot the way other girls wear prada and heels
7966457 mccains scheme isnt aimed at dividing the democrats because theyre already divided what hes trying to do is to show the democrat electorate that in her manifesto clinton was actually closer to mccain than to obama when debra says its ok its a way of showing that mccains not a typical republican like george bush that theres not a great deal of difference between voting for clinton or voting for a moderate republican whos open and less nationalistic than previous ones right now mccain gaining these votes could prove awkward for obama today mccain has support from 90 of the republican electorate while obama only has 80 from the democrats these tactics might seem unfair in france but theyre much less shocking in the us as far as im concerned i dont think theres anything wrong with using the remarks that clinton made hillary did say those things why not use them we havent lied at any point this kind of thing could happen in the next presidential election in france things change in the same way were seeing videos of joe biden saying things about obama before he was chosen as vp in the us its no scandal to change your mind people accept it you have to remember that mccain is not the only one using negative campaigning its just that the obama team targets state by state his videos arent as large scale theyre seen two or three times on cable tv and focus on certain communities or regions its the opposite of mccain who uses grand scale campaigns on the main channels so we have the impression that hes more aggressive but really its just because obamas team is more sophisticated
7966458 i was so excited i had no idea what she was saying
7966459 that was a nice surprise when mrs obama just showed up at the beginning we didnt know she was coming at the convention its hard to really see people but in the bar she was right there just a few yards from us suddenly she appeared i was so excited i started filming with a little flip camera i had i had no idea what she was saying i just videotaped the whole thing
7966460 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7966461 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7966462 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7966463 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7966464 our r amp d team didnt know much about this timing they are just put under pressure by those people sitting outside so at the moment development time wise weve just about managed to take on the arcade version on console obviously we have to balance the game and add on the other features for the console version were just working on it we still dont know

7966506 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
7966507 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7966508 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
7966509 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse

7966527 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
7966528 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7966529 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones

7966784 the washington posts security fix blog is running a fascinating series that peers inside some of the web based services cyber crooks are using to ply their trade from masking their identity to defeating captchas to creating counterfeit documents and validating stolen credit and debit cards everyone familiar with this space hears about these kinds of tools and services all the time in the abstract but the post blog includes screen shots and background details on the popularity of the services and how each one is helping to bring cyber crime that much closer to the realm of even the most newbie scam artists

7966836 there is an adage that the best sermons are not preached they are lived if you look at the life of senator mccain you see a life of courage of dedication of duty of honor of character of strength of patriotism in a measure that is epic
7966837 on the question of iraq john mccain has had the guts to stand out on his own arguing for what he thought was right and it turned out that he was right about the surge working to improve conditions in iraq
7966838 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7966839 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7966840 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7966841 eight weeks ago sen barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a toss up in these states sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start

7966843 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7966844 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7966845 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7966846 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7966847 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7966848 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7966849 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7966850 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7966851 never to my knowledge has there been such a concerted effort to bring the public together with the experts who hold the most knowledge about an area of human illness that accounts for more loss and devastation than any other
7966852 mental illness is so prevalent in our society estimated to affect as many as one in four north americans in any given year with one in 10 suffering serious chronic conditions
7966853 more individuals and families are speaking out today than ever before about the pain and loss caused by mental illness
7966854 we hope that people who are coping with mental illness their friends and loved ones and mental health professionals will all attend these forums to learn about the progress thats being made in understanding and treating mental illness and why there is reason for hope for improved treatments and even cures if research can continue to flourish
7966855 government funding for mental health research has remained flat in the united states and probably wont get better any time soon
7966856 but we cant wait for the government too many lives are at stake and we must not lose momentum in the pace of discovery weve achieved over the past two decades

7966887 im shocked by his suicide and my heart goes out to his family
7966888 you could see he was in true remorse for the shame he caused his family
7966889 he had gone to that property to do some yard work when he had not returned by late evening they started looking for him
7966890 he seemed to be doing quite well by all accounts he was sober since feb 13 was attending church on a regular basis
7966891 he said he had stopped drinking and was making positive changes in his life and preparing for the future after prison

7966906 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the us senate
7966907 i have realised over the years that theres a massive need for patients to undergo treatment without such high anxiety levels because the alternatives available are very limited
7966908 five years ago i decided the only thing i could bring in to tackle this was hypnotherapy so i contacted the top hypnotherapist in the country john butler
7966909 i remember being asked if i wanted to leave the room i was sweating and panting like a dog
7966910 the power of the mind is a lot more incredible than most people realise its possible to overcome fears and block out pain
7966911 although there is always some anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis learning as much as you can about the disease your prognosis and treatment options will help you feel more in control of your situation

7966917 the thing weve talked a lot about with our guys is managing those expectations and the only way you can manage expectations is to focus on what is going on this moment
7966918 if you dont focus on the moment youre not going to get better and if you dont get better and if you dont get better youre not going to reach your potential
7966919 i hope the maturity of the team and listening to the guys talk to the younger guys about what needs to be done and that anxiousness i feel our guys have about wanting to get better that hopefully will allow us every ball game to stare right at that game and say hey heres what needs to be done
7966920 it could happen i dont think we have one on the schedule for the next four or five years if you recall when the legislation for a 12 th game passed there was a mad dash for scheduling
7966921 there was a huge inventory gap for teams looking for games
7966922 i enjoy every game anytime you get a chance to play somebody else besides your teammates its fun competition is competition
7966923 somebody told me the hardest thing to do is beat somebody youre supposed to beat it doesnt matter who they put in the stadium were just ready to play
7966924 unfortunately even wirths languages contain a few constructs which are not ll 1 to analyze such constructs it is not sufficient to rely on syntactic information one must also take semantic information into account for example a type guard x t in oberon cannot be distinguished from a procedure call syntactically one has to consult the symbol table to find out if x is a procedure or a variable this ambiguity could have easily been avoided for example by using curly brackets instead of round brackets

7967229 for udsigterne til andet halv r og ogs til et stykke ind i 2009 ser vi ingen indikationer af at det skulle blive bedre derfor venter vi faktisk ogs at rockwool kommer ud og nedjusterer sin guidance i regnskabet
7967230 vi venter at rockwool kommer ud med en ny guidance der hedder 1100 til 1200 mio kr p nettoresultatet eksklusiv minoriteter
7967231 vi venter at de prisstigninger der har v ret p koks i de seneste tolv m neder vil sl igennem her har rockwool v ret meget sparsomme med at informere om hvad de betyder da de betragter det som en forretningshemmelighed men vi har regnet os frem til en ekstraregning for rockwool i 2008 p 380 mio kr udelukkende p grund af kokspriserne
7967232 kigger man p de europ iske markeder ser man geografiske forskelle men der er ingen tvivl om at man p markeder som tyskland england og spanien ikke vil v re i stand til at h ve priserne ligeledes har vi indikationer fra polen om at priserne p isoleringsmateriale er faldet 20 pct fra juli til juli det er klart at hvis vi pludseligt ser en normaliseret eftersp rgsel vil prisniveauerne fra 2007 ikke kunnet opretholdes
7967233 umiddelbart ville det sandsynligvis blive modtaget positivt af aktiemarkedet hvis rockwool fortalte at de ville tage det lidt roligt med kapacitetsudvidelserne for eksempel med fabrikken i kroatien fortalte rockwool i forbindelse med gen bningen at de ikke havde haft noget problem med at servicere markedet med de andre fabrikker i omr det det kan opfattes som om at kapaciteten ikke er n dvendig og bare vil forv rre den kapacitetsudnyttelse selskabet har

7967242 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments
7967243 russia is making i would say a number of irrational decisions
7967244 we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
7967245 the russians know their obligations and i dont know that it requires anyone going to russia to inform them of it
7967246 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5

7967253 our traffic monitoring network shows the start of a change in driving patterns and behaviour over the past six to 12 months
7967254 average motorway speeds have reduced as has congestion this indicates a reduction in the volume of vehicles especially hgvs travelling on the roads
7967255 one obvious explanation for this is that rising fuel prices and general economic concerns are making people think carefully about how they drive
7967256 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds it really is a case where less haste can mean more speed

7967297 questions about hacking through password resets have been raised before when paris hiltons cell phone was famously hacked in 2005 some tech sites reported that criminals simply used her dogs name easily found online to break in that theory was later discredited but it likely sent criminals scurrying to find famous peoples dogs names it also prompted researchers to study the issue which is also known as fallback authentication ariel rabkin a researcher at the university of california at berkeley is probably the first to attempt to quantify the problem he recently published a research paper pdf titled in part security questions in the era of facebook it examined password reset questions at 20 banks of the 215 questions used by the banks he classified only 75 as secure and usable the others were either easy for hackers to guess or obtain or simply too hard for consumers to remember

7967343 we cannot be diverted to the silliness that the mccain campaign of course they want to talk about paris hilton
7967344 would they want to talk about why they have the worst record of job creation in america
7967345 have attracted millions of more voters first voters voters and many more voters who havent voted in a long time
7967346 many of them are not even reachable by these pollsters

7967349 i wasnt taking any hits at john mccain i was just speaking truth about his record

7967377 what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment
7967378 lately many have stressed that obama needs to seize the advantage after an august of tightening polls distressingly successful negative campaigning by mccain and his surrogates and a natural lessening of voter interest during the summer lull but in truth the nature of modern conventions means that the risks are much greater for obama than mccain why to begin with since the 1970s the conventions have been stage managed to an inch of their lives devoid of twists and turns they are essentially a series of coronations speeches interspersed with promotional videos and music the visceral appeal of these gatherings for the party faithful and professionals who form the backbone of each campaign is undeniable as motivational tools and as a way to energize and mobilize the parties the conventions are a vital part of the presidential campaign as a venue to bring together politicos and reporters as well as lobbyists they always serve a function but they dont decide anything and increasingly they dont really matter to the voters
7967379 asking the wife of a candidate for president to address the national convention at which her husband is to be nominated is a relatively recent phenomenon

7967390 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7967391 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7967392 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7967393 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7967394 generally expected to be weak during the remainder of 2008 before recovering modestly next year

7967397 in fact so exuberant was williamson that he single handedly obliterated nationals advantage on tax by indicating the partys additional tax cuts will be swallowed up by motorists having to pay 50 a week to use the toll roads that national intends building through the mechanism of public private partnerships ppps opportunities to ping national big time do not come any more gift wrapped than this labour had a field day highlighting williamsons remarks on agenda bill englishs refuting of them and then williamsons admission he had let his enthusiasms go unchecked however williamson does not deserve to take all the blame for the snafu fault also lies in nationals strategy of avoiding saying anything in terms of policy detail which might unsettle voters it can hardly expect to get through the election campaign by wrapping all of its policy in cotton wool it will get pressed on detail the hard edges of policies need to be exposed by national the party only plays into labours hands by not being open about the negatives as well as being glowing about the positives williamsons lapse was an accident waiting to happen
7967398 but obviously the 64 000 question is when will we be at the bottom i dont think well see that this year
7967399 of course well have to watch it but that eventually would help to drive price recoveries
7967400 it doesnt reflect a recovering housing market it reflects a broken housing market
7967401 its a reflection of the fact that foreclosed homes are being liquidated at very low prices
7967402 i have spent days and nights thinking about why i said what i did in front of the sec on may 25 2007
7967403 my statement before the sec was completely out of character for me i have tried to live my life in a way that showed that hard work and honesty were their own reward

7967433 we have again displayed our ability to acquire considerable quality alberta oil sands assets we are committed to growing shareholder value through the development and acquisition of alberta oil sands assets and feel micron is at a turning point in garnering substantial market awareness in regards to other oil sands companies we have seen the major impact that oil sands assets can bring to otc companies such as canwest petroleum now bqi on amex which went from under 0 10 a share to a high of 8 90 due primarily to their oil sands assets we are at the early stages of development which typically provides the best leverage to anticipated future growth we have also started to focus on strategic marketing in europe as we have seen a sharp increase in our european shareholder base management is very confident that micron will be able to continue to acquire additional quality alberta oil sands leases in the near future the board is excited about the future developments of the company primarily because micron is currently one of if not the smallest market capitalized companies in the world class alberta oil sands which gives micron tremendous leverage to one of the largest know resource deposits in the world

7967447 when we were last here i think we were probably on show 20 of this tour and i honestly thought it was going to be a three month tour and here we are two years later you are going to be the recipients of 103 shows experience
7967448 im pleased that in this period of economic belt tightening my offices vigilance saved the state from being ripped off by entergy
7967449 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
7967450 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
7967451 human development begins at fertilization when a male gamete or sperm spermatazoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to produce a single cell a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
7967452 life begins at conception is a core issue of faith
7967453 this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7967454 shouldnt have an impact on a the womans right to choose
7967455 abortion always constitutes a grave moral disorder since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being
7967456 i know this will be tough and i wont always like doing the work that i will have to put in but its worth it
7967457 opt to work reduced hours while staying on the partnership track
7967458 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7967459 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7967460 all those involved from the lebanese authorities to the workers embassies to the employment agencies to the employers need to ask themselves what is driving these women to kill themselves or risk their lives trying to escape from high buildings
7967461 forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives
7967462 other groups have talked about civil disobedience tomorrow catholic and evangelical christians will peacefully break the law to protest the slaughter of the innocent by abortion and to call on fellow christians to reject the obama biden ticket of death
7967463 take a deep breath and breathe in that holy spirit of peace and breathe out that holy spirit of peace
7967464 god of peace way of peace peace thank you for all the blessings of peace that you give us encourage us to do your work of peace and justice and disarmament help us end poverty and starvation and relieveable sic disease and end the war in iraq and afghanistan and palestine and all of our wars and abolish the death penalty and torture and all our nuclear weapons and help us enact a global marshall plan to feed the worlds poor and justice and peace to all our sisters and brothers
7967465 house resolution 1078 recognizes that lasting security for america will be best achieved through policies of generosity and caring toward the rest of the world
7967466 1 2 of the gdp each year for the next 20 years toward once and for all eliminating domestic and global poverty homelessness hunger inadequate education inadequate health care and repairing the environment of the planet
7967467 create an international unbiased nongovernmental agency for receiving the funds and distributing them in a way that is environmentally sensitive respectful of native cultures safeguarded against corruption protected from manipulation to serve elite interests and empowering people in each region
7967468 this agency or mechanism should be governed by a board of ethicists religious leaders artists writers social theorists philosophers economists scientists and social change activists all of whom have demonstrated in the ways that they have lived their lives and conducted their public affairs that they give higher priority to the well being of others than the well being of the corporate or wealthy elite
7967469 there is another factor operating that dares not speak its name racism
7967470 imagine the cultural impact if tens of thousands of obama activists were to volunteer the month of october to go door to door in the contested states and ask people to discuss the issue of racism
7967471 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7967472 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7967473 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7967474 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7967475 we should still go forward in open and public regardless what the questions are
7967476 but planning and economic development general manager craig manly did he said recommendations in the report were based on legal advice and related legal implications can affect the countys future
7967477 all issues raised by council members at that meeting were discussed behind closed doors
7967478 this letter is proof positive that as far as chief montour is concerned both the minister of aboriginal affairs and the minister of community safety intervened with the opp in the recent caledonia blockade
7967479 it raises some very serious and troubling questions about the mcguinty governments interference into the enforcement of the law in this province
7967480 by failing to address the letter the minister has left the issue open to speculation and doesnt clearly admit or refute the chiefs claims
7967481 the minister has known about this issue since the end of april he has a duty to the crown and to the people of ontario to uphold the law
7967482 its time that the minister committed to calling in the rcmp to investigate this issue and provide the people of caledonia and all ontarians with the answers they deserve
7967483 first of all i want to thank you on behalf of the six nations of the grand river community for your intervention in the police action on saturday april 26 2008 your intervention has been instrumental in the reopening of the caledonia bypass
7967484 during the early evening of saturday an opp camera vehicle was driving past the protest site taking pictures of individuals
7967485 the decisions that resulted in the peaceful resolution of the road closure in caledonia were based on ongoing dialogue between the opp and six nations leaderships
7967486 at no time during this event or in relation to any police operation did anyone in government or elsewhere tell the opp to stand down or direct the operations of the opp
7967487 the decisions that resulted in the peaceful resolution of the road closure in caledonia were based on ongoing dialogue between the opp and six nations leadership and on the opp commitment to resolve such situations in the safest manner possible
7967488 the suggestion that political interference played a part is regrettable and untrue opp operational decisions are the purview of the police officers in charge decision making is influenced by factors related to the event and the overall need to maintain order and preserve the peace this is fully in keeping with the police role and authority
7967489 were going to put all of our resources into resolving these claims it is through that that we are going to achieve justice
7967490 i asked minister bryant if he had any influence on his fellow cabinet colleagues to look at ways we could relieve the situation
7967491 look chief you know i cant act directly with anyone but ill see who i can talk to and see if something can be done
7967492 at no time during this event or in relation to any police operation did anyone in government or elsewhere tell the opp to stand down or direct the operations of the opp
7967493 there were no arrests in caledonia there were in deseronto but none in caledonia
7967494 the arguing about whose responsibility it is to consult with them is not their problem to solve
7967495 they were within their rights to deny the appearance since it wasnt on the agenda but blocking information gathering sessions hardly promotes better communication
7967496 hey everyone look at me im powerful and everyone should be afraid of me
7967497 with all due respect donna your blogs are getting repetetive boring and smack of nothing but vengeance and finger pointing
7967498 haldimand seems to have a little group of people who have nothing better in their lives to do than to get in the way of others
7967499 pointing out the flaws of others and making other people who are actually doing something miserable
7967500 and then you have the audacity to compare donna pitcher to gary mchale if you honestly knew anything about eiter of these individuals you would realize you are comparing apples with oranges donna is a concerned citizen of haldimand county who is quite simply trying to do her part to keep council honest with the people who elected the members and pay their wages gary mchale is an outside agitator with a narcissistic complex who actually has the nerve to compare himself to the late martin luther king a fact which in my mind makes him dangerously delusional
7967501 gmchale administrator hero member posts 805 re aboriginal demonstrators have charges withdrawn reply 1 on today at 09 45 55 am another perfect example of how the media spins the news they dont have a problem using my name in a story while refusing to provide any quotes from me at no time did i express any frustration in fact i was quite positive about the fact i was filing a judicial review if they did quote from me they would have included a quote about how the opp refused to provide evidence which they are required to do by law and thereby in my view they wilfully sabotaged the charges the crown refused to review all the evidence which i can prove therefore the crown wasnt interested in finding out whether there was proof of extortion because they simply didnt want to have extortion charges against two native people
7967502 besides there is nothing to speak to at this time so why waste county time
7967503 this may never happen and if it does i am very sure the county staff will do their research
7967504 i thought they would want to hear what people had to say
7967505 i will not get into a situation of who will or will not be heard
7967506 this gives us time to discuss in haldimand if residents want it after they are informed so be it
7967507 anonymous said it baffles me why people like you and janet keep pressuring council members the do not have time for your petty issues get a hobby ladies and you will feel better august 10 2008 5 44 am
7967508 coun buck sloat said the nuclear decision is not a council issue and may never be this is a matter between two private corporations he said of united states steel which owns land in nanticoke and bruce power he added that council has not rejected by motion frasers delegation
7967509 on behalf of the nuclear industry i was delighted to respond to the invitation by haldimand norfolk leaders to provide information
7967510 they have demonstrated significant initiative in wanting to have an informed community
7967511 the economic impact locally of a nuclear facility could mean 1200 full time jobs and a 2 billion investment these would be good well paying jobs with significant spin off benefits to local businesses this investment would help our kids stay and raise their own families here
7967512 today was a good first step to see what the possibilities are i was really pleased to learn that the nuclear industry is now developing whats called third generation nuclear plants and that the spent fuel will be used in fourth generation plants
7967513 i think its important that the two counties haldimand and norfolk work together to explore the possibilities for increased jobs and economic development that could come from the development of a nuclear generating station at nanticoke
7967514 this information session is part of an ongoing effort across the country to address questions of local officials with regard to the additions to reserve policies
7967515 we have to protect land in haldimand county for all persons and businesses
7967516 if i can just create enough order and control enough things all the chaos will disappear and there will be no more surprises along the way to frighten me no more changes
7967517 we felt we have to do what our council is not doing
7967518 the most important thing is for haldimand county residents to be informed
7967519 i find it hard to believe a council would refuse to hear a citizens input on something so important for this area
7967520 its just mindboggling i feel we have no representation or voice
7967521 people have expressed an interest in forward looking and planning in the community as long as that interest remains it will always be an area of interest for bruce power
7967522 they will give us firm costs on reasonable parts of the project there will be opportunities for change where no reasonable person could expect to have anticipated that change
7967523 clean and green option that it is claimed to be nuclear works only because of governemtn support and large subsidies far in execess of those in place for renewables
7967524 im not sure one way or the other but so long as we have a government that is not accountable for its action and the majority of canadians dont give a damn the questions and b s will continue
7967525 whatever else one may think of lyn mcleod and jan carr no one can believe the premiers claim they stand at arms length from the governing liberal party
7967526 its always been on as far as looking at it
7967527 as soon as they seal that deal theyll do an ea environmental assessment
7967528 barrett calls for solicitor general of ontario and minister bryant to resign
7967529 he referring to chief bill montour then thanked bryant for taking his advice and asking the opp about standing down in tyendinaga and caledonia
7967530 last week barrett relayed a similar report found in the dunnville chronicle
7967531 two newspapers and two different reporters saying the same thing
7967532 i ask you again did you ask the solicitor general to interfere or were you were you yourself asking the opp about standing down in tyendinaga and caledonia
7967533 i think the member knows that nobody in this house no mpp no member of government is walking around with a holster and cuffs i think the member knows that it is up to police officers to execute that duty
7967534 i think the member knows that nobody in this house no mpp no member of government is walking around with a holster and cuf fs i think the member knows that its up to police officers to investigate that duty
7967535 over the weekend six nations band chief bill montour told aboriginal affairs minister michael bryant that the blockade was not criminal activity and said this could become something all party does not want it to be
7967536 gave credit to michael bryant for talking to the solicitor general who reportedly told the opp to stand down
7967537 then thanked bryant for taking his advice and asking the opp about standing down in tyendinaga and caledonia
7967538 two newspapers and two different reporters saying the same the same thing i ask you again did you ask the solicitor general to interfere or were you were you yourself asking the opp about standing down and in tyendinaga and caledonia given your previous statements these two reports are
7967539 if the member is suggesting that the solicitor general or any other minister or member should interfere with the operation of the opp hes wrong hes dead wrong
7967540 that allegation is ridiculous and no i will not resign because i wont interfere with policing operations
7967541 weve learned from past history that you dont interfere as government with policing operations
7967542 this violent criminal activity occurred outside of any legitimate protest and will not be tolerated
7967543 if the member is suggesting that the solicitor general or any other minister or member should interfere with the operation of the opp hes wrong
7967544 over the weekend six nations band chief bill montour told aboriginal affairs minister michael bryant that the blockade was not a criminal activity
7967545 he gave credit to bryant for talking to the solicitor general who reportedly told the opp to stand down
7967546 all we want to say is that god has issues with sin
7967547 dear sirs as owners of dce it seems your government has little or no respect for this country at a time when canadian soldiers are dying in battle for the rule of law and freedom it seems your government has little or no respect for the one thing that is vital to canada its flag the attached video will show you a defaced canadian flag that has been flying at the entrance to your property for a few days now canada day is only one week away and citizens of this country are forced to look at this every day since residents must drive past dce to go to work with the bridge closed the opp were contacted on june 20 2008 about this act yet nothing is being done a haldimand resident went there today to ask the occupiers to remove the flag with the request falling on deaf ears this property now belongs to the ontario government it is the responsibility of the ontario government to ensure that the property is clean and that such actions as to insult the flag of our country dont take place on crown land i would like to know immediately what your government is going to do to see that this defaced canadian flag is removed prior to canada day and properly disposed of and that those responsible are appropriately charged for doing this act i would also like to know when this government is going to have that site cleared completely cleaned up and properly policed so these types of actions cease your immediate attention is needed thank you
7967548 as far as we are concerned it was freedom of expression
7967549 no one with common sense can expect to cooperate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7967550 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments
7967551 this violent criminal activity occurred outside any legitimate protest and will not be tolerated
7967552 it would cripple caledonia and further destroy the business community
7967553 councillors took a firm stance against the blocking of hwy 6 bypass council passed a resolution asking the province and federal governments to stop negotiations until all blockades and or occupiers are removed from haldimand county
7967554 we are sick and tired of it said councillor buck sloat sloat said the road blockade in caledonia has nothing to do with land claims and pointed out that
7967555 our priority is to reopen the public roadway that was taken over by a group of people who do not have the support of the tyendinaga band council in relation to this roadblock
7967556 haldimand county councillors pointed out that the six nations protestors blocking hwy 6 do not have support of the chiefs who govern six nations band council and the traditional confederacy
7967557 grice said his wife is ready to move back to her hometown in port elgin
7967558 a return for normalcy is all every last citizen of caledonia wants and better yet deserves
7967559 its time to clean it up and get it out of here
7967560 haldimand council couldnt even get a call back from upper levels of government last weekend its devastating the way we are being treated
7967561 i and many others in this community were hopeful that mr fantino was going to announce the reinstatement of law enforcement regardless of race
7967562 according to minister bryant the blockade went up due to misinformation i would say that misconceptions are caused by misinformation blockades are erected by people criminals
7967563 minister bryant commended residents of haldimand caledonia for being so patient
7967564 well the allegation that the member seems to be making and i know he wouldnt want to make this allegation would be as against the standard set by the very institution and the people who in fact engage in decisions of police operations
7967565 the member congratulates the opp for their work in deseronto but i may say that i wouldve thought that the community was supportive as well of the work that the opp did in keeping the peace they make decisions operational decisions in deseronto they make decisions operational decisions in caledonia
7967566 councillor grice said leadership from upper levels of government is non existent
7967567 over the past two years the mcguinty liberals have made concession after concession to lawbreakers in caledonia deseronto and beyond
7967568 this government has failed and continues to fail to uphold the rule of law in ontario
7967569 while the blockade in deseronto has come down the one in caledonia is still up
7967570 the mcguinty government is negotiating with people illegally occupying land and treating what could be defined as extortion as ho hum even as it handicaps economic development in communities such as brantford and ignores an illegal smoke shop operating on government land within metres of a school
7967571 for those of you that are looking at this from far away you should not underestimate the temperature of this community and certainly do not mistake its resolve
7967572 natives are being treated differently than non natives he said probably because of ipperwash
7967573 blockades wont stop the province from negotiating with native protesters to resolve outstanding land claims and end a two year occupation on the outskirts of caledonia premier dalton mcguinty said yesterday mcguinty said he wont call off negotiations with six nations protesters unless hes told to do so by the provincial police and prime minister stephen harper
7967574 i am totally committed to do what is in my power to reach peaceful solutions however
7967575 the opposition says the liberals have been encouraging lawlessness by tolerating the recent escalation of aboriginal protests
7967576 if the member is suggesting that the solicitor general or any other minister or member should interfere with the operation of the opp hes wrong hes dead wrong
7967577 that allegation is ridiculous and no i will not resign because i wont interfere with policing operations
7967578 weve learned from past history that you dont interfere as government with policing operations
7967579 this violent criminal activity occurred outside of any legitimate protest and will not be tolerated
7967580 if the member is suggesting that the solicitor general or any other minister or member should interfere with the operation of the opp hes wrong
7967581 over the weekend six nations band chief bill montour told aboriginal affairs minister michael bryant that the blockade was not a criminal activity
7967582 he gave credit to bryant for talking to the solicitor general who reportedly told the opp to stand down
7967583 do i have faith that the federal government and the province will do whats best for haldimand county no i have faith that theyll do whats best for the federal and provincial governments
7967584 im proud of the residents who held themselves responsible and didnt let emotions get the better of them
7967585 were looking at a two tier system of justice they have to do something about it
7967586 is taking an absolute pounding if this keeps up it will fall into the river
7967587 were going to damage our roads beyond repair without that bypass open
7967588 the road closure has nothing to do with land claims so they can put up with the truck traffic
7967589 do i have faith that the federal government and the province will do whats best for haldimand county no i have faith that theyll do whats best for the federal and provincial governments
7967590 are prepared to be willing hosts to a nuclear plant in nanticoke
7967591 the citizens of norfolk need to collectively provide input so they are part of the solution not passive recipients of a future flawed nuclear solution
7967592 at the public consultation i was at there were a lot of people there and some of them raised concerns and asked questions
7967593 we have another possible solar project coming into norfolk he said the two women said asking for an environmental assessment ea for a nuclear plant on the nanticoke site was the wrong way to go about the process and instead a study should be done looking at all energy options travale said if another energy producer wanted to consider the property then he thinks the council would likely give approval to an ea for that alternative energy as well well there you have it now what do you think if we have a public meeting without the endorsement of haldimand county council would you attend i think it is time that the residents of haldimand and norfolk unite
7967594 mayor trainer says i think they are pooping on us
7967595 if thats what it takes well sit in front of the ministers office
7967596 we need straight up front conversation with ministries to see where they stand with haldimand county
7967597 if any good came out of this whole issue it has brought the county together
7967598 as a county we need to stand up and be counted
7967599 norfolk council is extremely pleased by this unexpected good news i extend thanks to premier mcguinty and his government for listening to norfolks issues and acting in such a generous manner
7967600 this is great news these are 100 percent funding dollars for the brant hill project in the port dover community and will allow the county to significantly improve our infrastructure in that area
7967601 i congratulate and thank the mcguinty government for assisting our community
7967602 one of the firemen called me and said the place was full of smoke
7967603 we fuss and fuss at people to get surge protectors and they do work
7967604 were fortunate we got the fire call if it hadnt been for that call there is no telling what would have happened to the building
7967605 despite what finance minister flaherty says corporate tax cuts are an especially uneven policy tool
7967606 these corporate tax cuts constitute a significant net fiscal shift in favour of alberta and away from ontario and every other non oil producing province
7967607 finance minister flaherty is picking winners as surely as any other finance minister including ontarios
7967608 surprisingly the winners hes picking are the provinces and industries that are already doing very well indeed
7967609 corporate tax cuts as expensive as they have been and will continue to be have had no visible impact on the broad pattern of business investment at all
7967610 in addition to asking whether the regional and sectoral impacts of the harper governments 15 billion annual corporate tax cuts are fair and acceptable to the majority of canadians we should also ask whether they will have any beneficial impact on canadas economy at all
7967611 there are provisions right now to be found in the highway traffic act or the criminal code that allow for prosecutions for people who are driving carelessly so unless and until i get different advice from the people who work our roads and look to their safety we will maintain our position
7967612 the minister is only the local mp and not the lead on either file
7967613 there was a metal chair with a metal belt that they actually strapped you down to
7967614 helping coordinate and organize the students for a free tibets actions via twitter
7967615 they threatened our lives threatened the lives of people we know of our family members and they told us that they could get us even outside of china
7967616 i dont miss my old life in new york i only miss the life in new york i know i never would have had
7967617 tensions in the city are mounting due to the increased frequency of and sites affected by the defendants unlawful activities a physical confrontation and disturbance of the peace or riot is inevitable and imminent
7967618 effectively protect public safety when the full scale disturbance or riot occurs
7967619 the mayor and his council have taken an entirely appropriate action to protect the best interests of the families and businesses in their community by bringing their case before the courts they have also strengthened respect for the law and for the rule of law
7967620 all my clients view this as being very positive and hope the city is successful
7967621 if the city is successful other communities will be looking at what brantfords doing and your city could become the hero
7967622 they want that registered on the land title so it creates a huge issue for the purchasers its not like you pay 5 000 and theyre gone besides what are they going to ask for next week
7967623 ive had developers say couldnt i just pay the money it would be cheaper and it would but i have to explain its not just about the money
7967624 this is a bold step and it was not considered lightly its out of necessity because we believe irreparable damage has been done
7967625 its not that were confident there is going to be a disturbance of the peace but if there is one we want to be able to deal with it we always hope for the best but it would be irresponsible of us as a municipality not to prepare otherwise
7967626 the larger interest of everyone is served by peace but were going to do whats necessary to protect the interests of the people of this community
7967627 in caledonia they community subcontracted their municipal force to the opp which was autonomous but i would think in brantford presumably the city police report to the city
7967628 but we do have the full and complete support of the police as were going through this process
7967629 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments
7967630 she has to have it at her house because its grandma day that is unprofessional and does not put us in a good light with counterparts at the provincial level if you want respect youve got to give respect whether or not you like the party or not
7967631 for that matter a lot of the biggest deals in the world have been made over a couple of drinks or a game of golf
7967632 and this poster doesnt see this as being a problem
7967633 what makes you think that the councillors put in less time then the mayor that is a crock
7967634 if the u s government allows fannie and freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately the consequences will be catastrophic
7967635 if it is not the end of the world it is the end of the current international financial system
7967636 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7967637 die polizeidirektion werra mei ner fahndet jetzt mit einem phantombild nach einem der t ter der an den k rperverletzungen in bad sooden allendorf beteiligt war
7967638 we cannot now confirm that u s ships will be travelling to poti
7967639 fairy tales are the purest and simplest expression of the collective unconscious processes
7967640 church bridge do not break i am not the true bride
7967641 church door dont break i am not the true bride
7967642 why do you have to be so honest maleen you are on your way to marry the prince just leave well enough alone
7967643 with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations president abraham lincoln in his second inaugural address march 4 1865
7967644 were flying in a lockheed eagle series l 1011 came off the line twenty months ago carries a sim 5 transponder tracking system and youre telling me i can still flummox this thing with something i bought at radio shack

7967647 well pleased with proceedings so far the guilty pleasures were eagerly awaited as recent plays of their new full length cd had left a choice taste in my forever at it gob this set backed up my feelings of a band suddenly finding a new lease of life in a career so far that has been similar to a bloke with a 12 inch todge lots of promise but never finding the right opening and struggling to reach a state of permanent inflation now we have a whole new ball game on our hands oooh sweaty and the gps are bursting from inside the underpants of restriction and are ready to penetrate wider circles circles rings ringpiece anus another blatant homesexual undercurrent which is really worrying this tired reviewer fear hate lies deceit corrupt authority brainwashed and the outstanding goodbye to the uk stuck in the old bonse but the whole package was efficient and several rungs up from previous efforts great to see and a fungal thumbs up now buy the cd twats

7967649 every year in the punk rock kitchen numerous punk rock sausages are thrown in the air and their destinies are left to that neutralised aloofer chance some sizzlers flop unceremoniously to the floor left victim to the all consuming critical rat that devours the hearts of the less stubborn players other prime porkers land in the bin almost as soon as the potential to be something is upon them they are lost forever due to nothing more than sheer bad luck some bangers come to rest near to the hob of action where the close proximity of the flame offers hope and prolongs life but then soon scares and the edible willy shrivels and fades into an unrecognisable state the lucky ones tumble straight into the frying pan of punk rock where a real opportunity to get cooking lies and a chance to release all the potential flavours within and achieve the tasty highs of spitting brilliance the cooking process can be long or brief dependent on the environment and the weeners wants one thing that can be said now is that the guilty pleasures are definitely in the pan the following cd is a real step up in class and has a consistent rage and deliverance so as to make one realise this lot are now set to a higher degree of heat and look ready to fry the electric storm that begins fear hate lies deceit bodes well and looms large without disappointing plenty of vocal discomfort rattling bass knife edge guitar and slamming drums all merge to make a thunder and lightning opener a stirring essence is exuded and built upon with the mature classiness of forget about the future a superb guitar sequence enlivens the whole rumble and there are one or two other moments that drip precocious talent what are we fighting for is a seething brew that breaks beautifully into a professional chorus worthy of any band many obvious influences are had here with anti flag rancid and uk subs most blatant but for me tgp add enough of their own fuel to make this a blaze of their very own corrupt authority storms with vehement pace and is a peach equalled in style with the commanding epic goodbye to the uk this is remarkable stuff and although the production may be about 10 down on a real masterpiece this is still a stunner with balls dropped the guilty pleasures machine churns on and nation state roars along on vibrant bass and gnashing lyrics in the bellowing slipstream comes dead and gone another number impregnated with capable musicianship and attention to detail the static boost of governments get away with it salivates a rythmic spittle awash with poisonous infection a song that enters the brain and refuses to leave until its melodic contagion has well and truly seeped into every ounce of cerebral tissue world religion causes war upholds the conflict theme and is a slightly heavier track with more sonic boom and weighted undercurrent its another pip in a well seeded fruit as is their army their war which is generally more regimented in melody but fractures superbly into a haunting tune of armeggeddon and death brainwashed and media deception close a very exciting effort indeed with the former containing a profundity of sound that reverberates strongly and with the latter containing an acoustic showcase that exudes a willingness to experiment and push boundaries in the fatty seas of punk rock flotsam the guilty pleasures have at last found bouyancy which i am sure they will maintain and sail strong and true into further murky waters may many a turd and used condom float by as this rocking trio find warmer and more welcoming oceans in which to cruise and may the accolades come as deserved great stuff indeed and as a follower and fan of the tgp crew i hope they keep on going in this new found direction
7967650 job opening pays big you just need to know how to communicate
7967651 say the wrong thing they and only they can be held accountable for it
7967652 say the wrong thing they and only they can be held accountable for it
7967653 remember council musled the mayor to speak how is that for communicating to the public its no wether you like the mayor or not its about free speach
7967654 the problem is that dalton mcguinty already has his hands over his ears
7967655 he has no intention of giving working families in ontario or seniors a break
7967656 if the government was interested in changing things they could change things
7967657 theyre very clear theyve made a decision theyre going to continue with that decision and theyre going through the motions with these hearings
7967658 whatever the details there have been clearly unintended consequences to local property taxpayers
7967659 we are asking you this morning that you recommend a legislated remedy that the province adopt legislation to clearly state that the ontario health premium is an employee responsibility and not the responsibility of employers
7967660 there is no doubt that this tax would have been eliminated had it been named differently perhaps the bureaucrat salary enhancement tax
7967661 dalton mcguinty has already explicitly stated that regardless of the outcome of this review the tax will not be eliminated
7967662 unfortunately this may be one promise he intends to keep
7967663 the thing that really upsets me the most is that training is run by contractors
7967664 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7967665 vorrei trovare una sola persona credo che ci sia da qualche parte a questa unica persona vorrei dare tutto ci che ho per cui laspetto prima o poi la incontrer
7967666 when i asked mayor trainer if council supports a nuclear plant for nanticoke her reply was that they have only agreed to an
7967667 there isnt one day that goes by that i havent been asked to run again
7967668 there is an awful lot of p and c private and confidential business
7967669 i would have a more open council and not so much p and c and i would let the public speak when they wanted to
7967670 i would have been a little more comfortable myself having that an agricultural advisory committee
7967671 communities surrounding the massive nanticoke coal fired power station which is set to shut down in 2014 are strongly urging the provincial government to consider the area for a new nuclear power plant
7967672 both norfolk and haldimand counties sent letters last month to premier dalton mcguinty asking for the go ahead to start an environmental assessment that would be filed along with a formal site application by nuclear operator bruce power according to haldimand mayor marie trainer
7967673 were not going to lose a year for an environmental assessment somewhere else
7967674 i think theyd like to start this as soon as possible
7967675 we do not yet have a solution to some of the transmission issues around bruce
7967676 if theres a shot for nanticoke its going to happen in 2008
7967677 those who have the privilege to know also have a duty to warn
7967678 we have to figure out how to use our coal plants less
7967679 theres going to be less pollution but pollution is still increasing from other sources like cars
7967680 we dont have plans to shut coal plants or do layoffs
7967681 then we can produce coal power for the next 400 years with this now known and clean coal technology clean coal technology is a new technology nuclear technology is over 50 years old with a well known amount of costly and dangerous baggage
7967682 well as long as you practice everyday and i mean everyday youll be on top
7967683 america will be altered in mentality and will move toward a more perfect spiritual existence
7967684 i see this great wave i tell people about this wave it wasnt a tidal wave this is a spiritual wave weve got to learn to love one another
7967685 be at peace among yourselfs seek to do good to one another and to all hold fast to what is good abstain from every form of evil
7967686 but as soon as a person has outgrown whatever local form of religion he was born to as soon as this religion can no longer embrace his life in all its fullness then the psyche becomes something in it own right which cannot be dealt with by the measures of the church alone it is for this reason that we of today have a psychology founded on experience and not upon articles of faith or the postulates of any philosophical system
7967687 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7967688 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7967689 its 3 a m and your children are safe and asleep
7967690 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
7967691 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
7967692 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
7967693 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
7967694 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
7967695 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
7967696 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
7967697 craig is a gifted actor and although he will be missed i look forward to the possibility of working with him again in the future
7967698 we respect craigs decision to leave the production and we will announce his replacement shortly
7967699 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
7967700 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
7967701 it seems to me everyone in the world should be obsessed with this
7967702 se ora a su hijo lo pari o lo teji
7967703 no lo s hay un mont n de lugares donde se pudieron haber escondido

7967708 les estamos dando de comer a los chicos con 55 centavos
7967709 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
7967710 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
7967711 direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7967712 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up
7967713 the elections are now behind us now is the time for us to put zimbabwe first
7967714 food is their latest weapon in their regime change agenda
7967715 to a praiseworthy search for peace and greater amity for our nation
7967716 happily all political parties in the country have acknowledged culpability in this violence
7967717 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the on going dialogue
7967718 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7967719 direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7967720 the report was regrettably seen in some quarters as big business yet again being negative and failing to assist australia to address the challenge of climate change
7967721 just in case you think i am advocating a free ride for industry let me make it clear that there is nothing in the bca submission that suggests that industry should not share some of the costs associated with the introduction of emissions trading
7967722 will likely smooth the short term dislocations of industry restructuring
7967723 for the first time in decades the pay equity gap grew wider after many women were forced onto individual contracts that stripped their pay to the barest levels in many cases illegally underpaying them and removing job security
7967724 it is essential that we see new ir laws introduced into parliament that scrap the rest of work choices and ensure all workers especially women get back their rights at work
7967725 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7967726 supply side risk does stem in the near term from possible disruption to production in the gulf of mexico
7967727 a lot of this is coming to completion after a good deal of work and i look forward to go to libya

7967751 they are both going to do what they have to do
7967752 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7967753 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7967754 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7967755 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
7967756 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset
7967757 some of its directed at the media very disappointed you cant control all those people these are ceos some of them major rich people
7967758 you cant call them and tell them what to do there is no question there is that category of people but i dont think people can blame her for their behavior i think thats probably unfair
7967759 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
7967760 she wants to reassert her relevance and introduce a new political identity
7967761 i think she understands that if she runs again she has to run a different style of campaign
7967762 and shes got a huge opening right now for the first time in her career she actually has a base to invigorate at the beginning of the 08 campaign she was the issue she had to explain herself her celebrity now shes got a base the working class and she needs to speak to them
7967763 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7967764 theres the possibility of a category 3 to category 5 hurricane in the gulf on sunday theres major change in the track just since yesterday and im sure theres going to be more but thats what has everyones attention right now if we get a major hurricane in the gulf theres going to be a lot more short covering
7967765 shes going to thank her supporters and then most importantly she is going to tell her supporters we all have to come together to support barack obama
7967766 she is going to fire em up and she is going to draw some distinctions too and she is going to talk about what john mccain will mean for this country and how we cant allow him to be president
7967767 she knows what she has to do tonight she is going to do it
7967768 shes going to tell the hall and all of america that the candidate that she most wants to see as president of the united states is barack obama
7967769 i think thats going to carry a tremendous amount of weight with democrats that may not be as excited right now as wed like them to be
7967770 his number one deficiency in the views of the voters that havent made up their mind yet is that he lacks the experience and judgment to step into the role of commander in chief so i didnt see anything last night that leads me to believe he has begun to bridge that gap
7967771 all of us in the heat of the campaign and primary say words that we later regret
7967772 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7967786 i was an undergrad at harvard at 17 because of the war they compressed my two year introductory physics course into one
7967787 we wanted to be successful contributing to the war effort

7967832 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
7967833 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers
7967834 i think that just as we got a massive blip up with gta iv which was not exclusive well get exactly the same blip up with final fantasy
7967835 i know it will look great on ps3 and its up to microsoft to clarify this its still exclusive in japan
7967836 well this is just my policy but i dont want to give an exclusive character for any particular console and that applies to downloadable characters as well because its not very fair when you think about this as a board game or a tool hidden characters if were going to talk about hidden characters they wont be hidden any more

7967856 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
7967857 a prosecution figure of 7 per cent for rape is extremely low what this means is the vast majority of rape cases never make it as far as court no one can suggest with any credibility that the vast majority of women reporting rape are lying
7967858 rape is a crime which can take a lot of courage to report and it can come as a shock for women to hear that their case is not being prosecuted
7967859 this includes looking at the initial response from the police right through to what happens in court if the case gets this far rape crisis scotland is calling for a comprehensive and independent study into attrition in rape cases in scotland until we know exactly what the problem is why so many cases are falling down its hard to see how we can know what the solutions are likely to be
7967860 there are a variety of reasons why rapes reported to the police do not result in a prosecution in court and these apply across the country
7967861 there should be no doubt that we will gather all available evidence in the public interest and where we have sufficient evidence to bring before a court we will present a compelling prosecution case
7967862 instances of rape or at least allegations of rape are too numerous for us to accept 7 per cent of cases ever being prosecuted that doesnt make sense at all
7967863 this training is a vital part of ensuring there is a professional determined approach to gathering evidence and bringing prosecutions before the court
7967864 the development of this course is an important step in improving responses to rape
7967865 we are delivering reform to ensure victims are afforded a sufficient level of support through the judicial process
7967866 we applaud and plan to emulate the swedish approach for the best of reasons many residents believe that if you regulate prostitution you make women safe but as soon as you discover the violence and exploitation endured by women every day it cannot possibly be condoned
7967867 sexual exploitation is completely unacceptable so were doing what we can to address and tackle the demand
7967868 it is a myth that prostitution is the oldest profession and that it will always be with us we are in this for the long haul but do not underestimate the challenge it represents
7967869 no country or city has managed to get rid of the problem but countries such as sweden have begun to see an impact they have seen no growth in prostitution and a significant reduction in trafficking
7967870 there have been remarkable successes such as women going on to university and securing challenging jobs
7967871 do we really want to be known as the bangkok of the northern hemisphere
7967872 what kind of values do we wish to promote in our society we are committed to denying those who profit from this exploitation
7967873 i get so angry when i hear people who really havent properly researched the subject say blithely lets follow the swedish model
7967874 the people in glasgow who are promoting this sort of approach really should have the humility to ask why it is in edinburgh the number of people working as street prostitutes have dropped in aberdeen its stable and in dundee its stable
7967875 glasgow with its zero tolerance stance im afraid has the worst record of all in coping with the numbers of street prostitutes and they continue to rise
7967876 it is likely to be ineffective from the point of view of the general public from the point of view of the prostitutes and from the point of view of anyone affected by prostitution
7967877 studies show that criminalisation and clampdowns on kerb crawlers merely cause sex workers to work longer hours in greater isolation leaving them more vulnerable to attack as well as reducing their access to essential services
7967878 thai people will definitely be offended by the idea that the only thing people associate with bangkok is prostitution
7967879 he should have chosen his words more carefully you can make a point about problems in glasgow without having to drag another countrys reputation through the mud
7967880 it was 8am on a monday over a year ago when suddenly there were all these voices in my house i thought they were jehovahs witnesses at first then they said they were the police they didnt tell me why they were there for ages but they knew things about my children their names and what they were doing i got more and more scared i dont think ive ever shaken so badly then they showed me the search warrant i couldnt believe my eyes the words indecent images of children i was in shock and had no inkling of what my partner was doing yet at the same time i had a sort of sudden understanding of why he hadnt been easy to live with for so long i had to send the police off to the business we run to arrest him i thought thats the end of my world the first thing he said when he was arrested was im going to have to commit suicide thats the first thing i thought hed do when i read the search warrant ive known him for 20 years i knew what hed think meanwhile they searched the house took away any computer materials the senior policewoman came with me to wake my teenage daughter i told her what had happened she didnt take it in then we went to the school my other daughters were taken into a room one by one with me and their older sister and the police and told what had happened they were devastated then without me they were questioned about their relationship with their father it was devastating that their dad had this interest and also that someone might think he was doing that to them which was not the case they chewed us up and spat out how do you deal with it we did lots of talking we were all sitting on a bed that night and someone thought of dad all on his own and we sent him a text saying we loved and supported him and were there for him he didnt come home he could have but didnt it was better that we had some space we spoke on the phone the next night it was dreadful hes such a kind hearted person and he felt strongly that he wanted his children to have a childhood yet it didnt occur to him that he was taking away someone elses ive always thought the people doing these things were monsters but i cant think that any more because this does not define him he has a heartfelt desire to deal with the problem and it is something he has to atone for he got a non custodial sentence but this has tainted him forever i feel tainted forever i didnt tell anyone for an awfully long time my mother and siblings dont know i did tell a few friends but aside from one couple who stood by both of us they support me but not him i dont blame them but it upsets me it doesnt work unless they support all of us im an open person but i cant communicate with people in the way i used to there is always this black cloud that i cant tell anyone about i feel sad about it but i made the choice for my family to have as normal a future as possible and for my future and his to be as normal as possible wed been together for years but actually got married after this happened just our daughters were present we realised our family was the most important thing in our life and as a couple we have a lot of work to do but that has to come after he has done the work on himself first if i didnt have absolute confidence that in his heart he wants to overcome this i couldnt do it none of us view his arrest as anything but positive because it is really the only route out he needed help to stop i know that he tried to stop himself at least once because actions he took which didnt make sense at the time now fall into place but how could anybody with three daughters addicted to illegal activities of this nature and on whom the entire family was financially dependent ever admit what he was doing
7967881 when my husband and i were first arrested we were about to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary so i thought i knew him
7967882 the police came to our door on a winters morning just after 6am arrested my husband and took away the hard drive of our computer
7967883 i never looked at child pornography it said on the website that these were artistic images

7967905 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
7967906 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7967907 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
7967908 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against climate change
7967909 it has to be one of the three best matches i played in my life

7967914 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
7967915 we incorporated his injury into it not because it was absolutely necessary but director michael bay in particular wanted to be able to protect him on the set
7967916 hes still going to be running around in this movie
7967917 bay literally just wanted for labeoufs safety to make sure that we werent playing around with his injury thats why we put it in
7967918 the stuff where it would be dangerous has not been scheduled yet and that stuff its important to put the injury in there
7967919 after investing about 5 million its kind of easy to invest an additional 102 000 so basically i agree with the rest of the court that we should go ahead and add those machines

7967921 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well

7967923 se necesita una infraestructura acorde al servicio acad mico que queremos brindar sabemos que una universidad no es s lo ladrillos pero el mbito f sico es necesario para las tareas acad micas para la investigaci n y para el encuentro de los docentes y alumnos
7967924 con esta obra hemos querido resignificar el ingreso de nuestra universidad d ndole la jerarqu a que se merece y otorg ndole al edificio la fachada que le faltaba esta obra viene a sumar una importante cantidad de aulas y m s de dos mil metros cuadrados lo cual habla del deseo de llevar la infraestructura edilicia a la altura de los procesos pedag gicos que se desarrollan en nuestra casa de estudio
7967925 sabemos que esta inauguraci n es el fruto del deseo de crecer y detr s de eso vemos valores que queremos transmitir el deseo de crecer y progresar para servir mejor son parte de los ideales que alentaron a nuestros fundadores y que nosotros queremos transmitir a los futuros profesionales que se forman en nuestras aulas
7967926 sabemos que necesitamos continuar invirtiendo en otros aspectos que no son s lo las infraestructura sino tambi n los recursos humanos que hacen a la investigaci n a la docencia y a los proyectos de extensi n en este sentido vemos que hay un camino que se est recorriendo pero somos concientes que de lo que falta por delante
7967927 esto que inicialmente se llam la construcci n de la fachada de la universidad no quede en las luces de la apariencia sino que construya transformaci n en la esencia de la universidad cat lica para que podamos cumplir con nuestra misi n b sica que es perfeccionar la cultura
7967928 los felicito y aliento porque para el mundo de hoy todo lo que tenga que ver con la educaci n es una apuesta fuerte que hay que hacer el mundo necesita sentido horizontes una universidad tiene que ser un mbito de entusiasmo por las cosas grandes por la verdad por la belleza por la vida
7967929 the use of interdistrict choice programs is unlikely to increase most students educational opportunities significantly a new report concludes despite recent attention to the idea as a means of reducing economic and racial segregation and giving students in low performing public schools a chance to find a better school
7967930 only a limited number of students in a limited number of locations are likely to benefit from interdistrict choice and even then only if carefully crafted policies succeed where many past programs have failed

7967941 what we require the other five parties require is a verification package in order for us to go forward in delisting north korea
7967942 the north is well aware of this we have been very clear and consistent on this point so there should be no surprise for north korea what is required of it
7967943 to see how things play out in the coming weeks
7967944 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7967945 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
7967946 it is apparent that euro dollar is becoming more sensitive to downside surprises in eurozone economic data than us negative surprises
7967947 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7967948 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7967949 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions

7967967 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
7967968 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history

7967972 its time savers started to take care of their savings by choosing a home for them wisely especially in the current economic downturn there are hundreds of poor paying accounts so people need to avoid them if you dont know what interest you are currently earning contact your provider if it is paying a low rate and you want it to earn more then move it although it might be tough to put money away at the moment it is more important than ever to make sure your existing savings work as hard as they can for you

7968043 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7968044 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7968045 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7968046 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations unaddressed
7968047 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success

7968056 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise
7968057 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7968058 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7968059 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7968060 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed

7968065 it worked two years ago but people are really taking a serious look at the candidates they want more than just the sound bite they want people who have experience and they want people who will make the right changes in policy
7968066 the bookies in the u k have been pretty poor performers recently paddy powers certainly held up better than they have

7968075 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point ceasefire agreement
7968076 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
7968077 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
7968078 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president dmitry medvedev signed
7968079 this contradicts principles of territorial integrity as a fundamental right
7968080 i have always been very much for maintaining talking to each other so we shall continue to talk to the russians as germans but one has to make clear if you want to cooperate in a spirit of partnership you can only do that on the basis of the recognition of international principles
7968081 we need to tell the russian side how we see things i will make efforts to make it point of view yet again in direct talks before monday
7968082 we were fighting terrorism and our goal was to bring stability
7968083 we gave numbers of martyrs to get this goal now we are afraid that kurds could be targets for revenge attacks by the terrorists
7968084 during the period we served there we did not discriminate between people as arabs kurds and turkmen
7968085 during our deployment there in spite of the serious threats we were happy because we felt we had secured the lives of people in these areas
7968086 there are at least two important points remaining which are the timetable and the participation of soldiers in the elections and their neutrality in those elections
7968087 as political leaders we cannot take part in a process which will isolate mauritania
7968088 i was on the phone today with asif zardari and he mentioned that he was going to be in dubai on september 2 to meet with you he says you are providing advice and help
7968089 can i ask what sort of advice and help are you providing
7968090 governmental private personnel sic how is he zardari supposed to know
7968091 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the deals
7968092 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed that meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari
7968093 ambassador khalilzad is well known throughout the region and he has a lot of contacts he is very well informed about the region
7968094 the present secretary really does respect his counsel and it is not unusual for senior officials of the government to have wide ranging contacts with various leaders

7968106 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7968107 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
7968108 let me be very clear aip is not in violation of any federal statute regulation or other applicable law

7968110 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7968111 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7968112 theyre going all of these routes threats intimation to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
7968113 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7968114 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
7968115 everything was absolutely ideal on the day i bombed the pentagon
7968116 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7968117 he firmado los decretos de reconocimiento por la federaci n rusa de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjazia

7968119 una violaci n directa de numerosas resoluciones de la onu sobre la integridad territorial de georgia resoluciones que han sido aprobadas por la propia rusia

7968126 will the gops cynical lies destroy the chance for serious energy and climate policy
7968127 but if we had a president who was capable of truly inspiring people and who actually believes in government led clean energy policies then i think it will happen

7968132 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed

7968140 est formado por jugadores que han acumulado mucha experiencia en encuentros internacionales

7968152 the russian move into georgia has begun a tectonic shift in the mideast region
7968153 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the u s
7968154 russia is never after a new sanctions resolution we hope constant contacts between iran and the iaea the u n nuclear agency will lead to a realistic solution guaranteeing that iran is not after nuclear weapons technology
7968155 syrias bad negotiating position with israel is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7968156 ready to cooperate with russia in any way that can strengthen its security
7968157 this is truly shocking its exactly the definition of a police state the police will have the details of a whole generation for so called crime prevention
7968158 it raises a lot of issues and we havent had a debate in parliament about it
7968159 an investigation of a crime toward or by the child
7968160 this is yet another revelation about the database state that is shocking but not surprising
7968161 the police have always been able to look into whatever they want but the information age changes the scale of that completely
7968162 parents should know that this is not for the protection of their children it could be used to prosecute them this is a serious step on from what little has been told to the public
7968163 the purpose of contactpoint is not crime detection it is to help improve services to children including safeguarding vulnerable children
7968164 to access contactpoint for the purposes of prevention or detection of crime or for the prosecution of offenders police would have to make a special request directly to the secretary of state or local authority and make a case for disclosure
7968165 do whatever you like but just dont scare the horses

7968171 but the proles if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength would have no need to conspire they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it and yet

7968175 the records will be updated until children turn 18 then kept in an archive for six years before being destroyed meaning they can be accessed until a young person reaches 24
7968176 papers are very important it puts limits on the new prime minister for example the weak point of israeli syrian negotiations are papers signed by former prime ministers that now must be abided during current negotiations
7968177 we were also told not to worry too much about scattered jewish properties in arab neighborhoods or yeshivas jewish seminaries in the old city
7968178 det va planerat vi ville och det var inte bara f r att det var
7968179 es el partido m s importante desde que estoy aqu
7968180 sin lugar a dudas es el partido m s importante desde que estoy aqu hace dos a os lleg en el verano de 2006 para m y para los jugadores es el de mayor transcendencia hablaba con cerezo y dec amos lo mismo es el m s importante desde que es presidente

7968184 el partido tiene una dificultad vamos perdiendo 1 0 hasta que no seamos capaces de igualar la contienda hasta ese momento es donde nos hemos preparado hemos estado trabajando m s en la tranquilidad que hay que tener en 90 minutos nos hace falta un gol para que empiece la eliminatoria nos hemos preparado para tratar de igualar la eliminatoria que hoy est desnivelada
7968185 habl con la plantilla y les dec a a los jugadores que la obligaci n era entregarse en el terreno de juego correr luchar y pelear por esta camiseta esa es la obligaci n y la transmiti el presidente pero no habl de resultados
7968186 todos los que estamos en el atl tico sabemos que es un jugador importante pero hasta l lo ha dicho un equipo lo formamos todos los 24 jugadores de la plantilla y kun es uno de ellos tiene unas caracter sticas especiales y distintas pero est claro que la labor del conjunto est por encima
7968187 pienso que la plantilla est consciente como yo de que es un jugador m s al que no le podemos meter m s presi n entiendo que la prensa y la gente est vida de ponerlo como el m ximo salvador kun y la plantilla son inteligentes y saben cada uno su parcela y qu trabajo tienen que hacer
7968188 va a estar muy motivado no es lo mismo venir con la medalla de oro que ser eliminado y venir vac o para el equipo nos da alegr a por l pero no es significativo tenemos que jugar con y sin el kun y jugar bien

7968195 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come

7968276 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
7968277 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7968278 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
7968279 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against

7968282 disturbing whether the dog is real or fake dead or alive yes a hanging offense no but the clip is a useful cultural rorschach test those who buy into the soldier as monster narrative are up in arms demanding that the soldiers be hunted down and shot
7968283 im sure gloria steinem and the berkeley city council would agree
7968284 the court jesters are just like the wonkette people who would try to ridicule ron paul with mickey mouse cameras and demeaning questions

7968329 fuel economy is extremely important to customers today and an estimated gain of up to 1 in fuel efficiency can help produce significant annual savings for a truck fleet or owner operator

7968340 therefore the objective is find new materials and novel device structures for cost effective photovoltaic devices
7968341 the beauty of organic photovoltaics and organic leds is low cost and flexibility
7968342 these devices can be fabricated by inexpensive solution based processing techniques similar to painting or printing

7968380 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can

7968420 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion

7968422 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
7968423 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
7968424 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others

7968426 wir sind trotz der gesamtwirtschaftlich tr beren lage optimistisch dass der konsum sich nicht so entt uschend entwickeln wird
7968427 f r den einzelhandel sehen wir derzeit keinen grund unsere umsatzprognose f r das gesamtjahr von nominal 1 5 zu ndern
7968428 die ber monate dramatisch gestiegenen preise f r l und lebensmittel
7968429 und nach dem jahr in dem uns die mehrwertsteuer den umsatz verhagelte gehen wir von einem sehr niedrigen niveau aus
7968430 wir sind froh ber diese schnelle einigung mit dem gbr damit endet die phase der unsicherheit nun k nnen wir mit der umsetzung des wirtschaftlich zwingend notwendigen abbaus und den gespr chen mit den betroffenen mitarbeitern unmittelbar beginnen

7968436 to help communicate this message we are launching a campaign to promote inclusion social justice and human civility across our campus
7968437 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7968438 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
7968439 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7968440 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
7968441 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
7968442 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7968443 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
7968444 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
7968445 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
7968446 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7968447 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7968448 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
7968449 it depends on the bishop of a certain region and fortunately for me communion has not been withheld and im a regular communicant so that would be a severe blow to me if that were the case
7968450 usually in a contest the guys who spin the most win but i have been spinning some big threes and sevens and i was winning yesterday so i think its a great comp you dont have to do a 1260 or something to win

7968468 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
7968469 this year the historic high water mark of 193 000 hectares of opium cultivated in 2007 has dropped by 19 percent to 157 000 hectares
7968470 the drug threat in afghanistan remains unacceptably high we are particularly concerned by the deterioration in security conditions in the south where the insurgency dominates
7968471 the most glaring example is hilmand province where 103 00 hectares of opium were cultivated this year two thirds of all opium in afghanistan
7968472 if hilmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7968473 were not satisfied and we will never be satisfied until we really start squeezing poppy cultivation out of the hilmand economy

7968480 in 50 years of interviews jerry siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery
7968481 your father dies in a robbery and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the worlds greatest hero im sorry but theres a story there
7968482 america did not get superman from our greatest legends but because a boy lost his father
7968483 superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability
7968484 supermans invulnerability to bullets loss of family destruction of his homeland all seem to overlap with jerrys personal experience theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for superman
7968485 i believe i have the first accurate account jerrys father wasnt shot and robbed he had a heart attack during a robbery
7968486 had no pensions no contracts no health benefits and companies didnt even pay for the artists supplies when these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves they were either collectively cast out or made false promises
7968487 having their names listed as supermans creators was the biggest victory of all
7968488 kurt vonnegut jules pfeiffer will eisner eli wallach and his wife were there

7968494 you have to give credit to the obama campaign they out organized everyone a year ago we all thought sen clinton would be the candidate for president and therefore the president we all thought that if there was some other candidate who would emerge it would not be someone that hardly anyone had ever heard of barack obama
7968495 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by these games but we have not been intimidated i am absolutely convinced that we can do the same without blowing the 9 3bn 17bn budget

7968563 the 2007 levels already disappointing because they are worse than those for the 2001 recession are likely to constitute a high water mark for the next few years this suggests that significant pain may lie ahead for many americans
7968564 we advocate for a shift in tax incentives for health insurance so lower income americans get money to purchase coverage
7968565 we also want insurance market reforms to provide individuals more choices and ensure coverage for high risk patients

7968600 ive heard from mothers struggling to make ends meet because their salaries arent keeping up with the cost of groceries
7968601 but if they take a second job they cant afford the additional cost of childcare or the moms who are nervous about taking time from their jobs to care for a sick child or the moms to be who are scared of getting fired if the boss finds out theyre pregnant then there are women who work hard every day doing the same jobs as men but earning less these struggles the struggles of working women and families across america arent new to me or to any of us

7968621 weve all heard the adage that it costs more to attract a first time guest than a repeat customer
7968622 the heart and soul of this principle resides in that first time customers experience and how likely they will be to return as a result the oregon q care program raises the bar on the level of customer service provided by staff in every position of the organization helping them understand the central role they play in customer satisfaction

7968654 the news today that 45 7 million people are uninsured 1 3 million less than in 2006 while positive should not be viewed as current progress toward solving this crisis
7968655 the u s economy was in better shape when this data was collected and states were expanding enrollment of low income children in medicaid and schip
7968656 since then schip expansion has been vetoed twice the housing and banking crises have created huge economic problems and there has been an abrupt rise in oil costs with serious economic fallout
7968657 in 2007 the insurance data was already demonstrating a decline in the number of people who had private insurance and the number who had employer based insurance

7968691 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
7968692 that all changed in 1960 when kennedy chose lyndon johnson as his running mate
7968693 will make the next president cautious about giving the vice president too much authority
7968694 one thing is clear biden does nothing to brighten obamas prospects in the electoral college
7968695 if for some reason obama is incapacitated or perish the thought dies in office people know he would be a competent president

7968982 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans

7968994 the trip will put the bush administrations most prominent hawk in a war zone still occupied by lingering russian troops and is likely to irritate leaders in moscow who have condemned the united states for siding with georgia in the conflict
7968995 it will also underscore the extent of disagreement within the bush administration over how forcefully to confront moscow cheney and his aides unsuccessfully argued in favor of increasing military aid to the fledgling georgian democracy according to officials familiar with the debate
7968996 cheneys visit is likely be watched closely in part because he is widely seen as a representative of the bush administrations most hawkish tendencies during a trip to lithuania in may 2006 cheney
7968997 andrew kuchins director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies said cheneys visit will probably amplify the mixed messages coming from washington over the georgian crisis
7968998 while bush and others from both parties have railed against russia for its actions the official u s response has been limited primarily to diplomatic efforts and humanitarian aid the pentagon has explicitly ruled out a military confrontation with russia
7968999 in a direct challenge to russia the us has announced it intends to deliver humanitarian aid to the beleaguered georgian port city of poti which russian troops still control through checkpoints on the citys outskirts
7969000 the aid will be delivered on wednesday by ship a us embassy spokesman said
7969001 while western nations have called the russian military presence in poti a clear violation of an eu brokered cease fire a top russian general countered on tuesday that using warships to deliver aid was devilish

7969032 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7969033 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7969045 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7969046 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7969047 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7969048 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7969052 since 1983 studies have suggested an interaction between the severe life events psychological distress and the etiology development of cancer however these associations are still under dispute
7969053 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7969054 young women who were exposed to a number of life events should be considered as a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly

7969058 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7969059 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7969060 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7969061 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7969062 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7969063 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7969064 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7969065 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7969066 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7969067 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7969068 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7969069 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7969070 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7969071 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7969072 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7969073 thats boring wait exposed as in the ballet dancers are naked no okay yeah thats booooring
7969074 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7969075 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7969076 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7969077 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7969078 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7969079 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7969080 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7969081 who are open to doing something on the production side
7969082 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7969083 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7969084 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7969085 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7969086 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7969087 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7969088 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7969089 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7969090 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7969091 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7969092 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7969098 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7969099 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7969100 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
7969101 t he fox has a bushy tail and bush tells lies and fox trots so i dont know whats real
7969102 the album formerly known as the n word is a politically charged album in the same vein as early ice cube and public enemy
7969103 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7969104 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7969105 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7969106 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7969107 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7969108 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7969109 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved im just glad to be in the mix with that

7969118 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7969119 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7969120 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7969121 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7969122 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7969123 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
7969124 you have mixed news here mirroring the mixed news in the economy last year
7969125 but i think it is quite reasonable to say 2007 was a peak year and still median income is slightly below the 2000 level poverty is higher and child poverty is way up you have a cycle here that was very sluggish

7969127 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7969132 im sitting here having just rolled out of bed wearing a vintage slip i dont have any makeup on my hair is probably a disaster but that doesnt mean ill put on a tracksuit simply because no ones looking i dont know why everyone wants me to wear jeans so badly
7969133 you could have paid 20 for me to sit on your lap any night of the week so it would be rude of me to say im not a stripper im a burlesque queen

7969135 i have this really amazing showgirl costume with a matching star headband
7969136 i found it on ebay when i was pregnant like outrageously gigantic and it just happened to come in the mail right when my daughter was born so i connect the two its stupid but i do
7969137 and i only like wearing things that make me feel like im in another time from another place the star of my own fairy tale ill wake up and think i want to be a farm girl from the 1930s
7969138 i try to wear outfits that make the statement im looking to make
7969139 if im going on larry king live to make a point about obama i might wear a very plain suit and tie best not to get in the way of your message at a march however i might wear a flashy walking suit because people are going to see me leading the way i may want to give a statement of anger so im going to dress in a safari like number i sometimes want to appeal to mercy in which case ill dress more ministerial anyone in the public eye who doesnt think about their physical presence is inept
7969140 i kept my hair like browns when a lot of my black nationalist friends felt that was inappropriate
7969141 the sun lights the moon as the moon lights the sun
7969142 i repeat when you clap your hands they make an impact
7969143 mary had a crimson petticoat made for her execution so that it would match her blood
7969144 i have a strict policy in my home no television and no press id rather stay isolated and dream away the next collection
7969145 i never wanted to create clothes just for skinny girls with no boobs
7969146 i always have a hard time keeping a style once its become trendy i feel like all the personality slips away when everyone is doing it but thats because im egotistical and i always like to be somewhat off
7969147 when jenny told us that we were going to be wearing the same costumes we were mortified we were like you cant do this to us
7969148 how can you wear the same three items of clothing every single day and still look fresh
7969149 a really high end designer or something we found in a store for five dollars
7969150 we want people to recognize us as individuals but also as a duo
7969151 we used to wander on stage in whatever wed been wearing for the previous day or two and not just from one day to the next but from one year to the next
7969152 j nsi birgisson guitarist and vocalist looks like a victorian chimney sweep kjartan sveinsson keyboardist adopted a kind of classical composer garb or sometimes a super sleek helmut lang skintight affair and orri p ll d rason drummer has a variety of outfits stretching from
7969153 im still surprised that i dont see more people wearing ballpoint pen makeup
7969154 there are no clothes that i consider outrageous my favorite page in tabloids is when bad clothes happen to good people i have a funny bikini that i wear all summer with popsicles on it saying lick me is that outrageous
7969155 she had put it up for auction to bail out her pop singer girlfriend from jail

7969157 maybe ill start wearing jnco jeans again or ufo pants at some point in the future ill be wearing white cargo shorts sandals with white socks and a golf visor thats inevitable
7969158 they dont know nor do we i hope we can evolve it our relationship but we arent seeing any change thus far
7969159 thats not at all true the company is growing and we are bigger now than we were a couple of months ago we adjust our resources accordingly and we have increased our sales group by 600 percent we make adjustments of resources based on market but the report was false
7969160 i think what people forget is that this deal has been in the works for at least a year and what theyve been negotiating is what will googles revenue share be and who will have access to the rich customer data and as more and more carriers recognize that they are a critical component no matter how big the check google writes its the trojan horse knocking on the door
7969161 in every single case we have carriers moving up the food chain we are expanding with at amp t and really restructuring that relationship and getting close to announcing industry changing news
7969162 being sold out is difficult and it depends on the market in spain we have 90 percent sell out rates and in sweden its lower and in the u s its lower its an evolution of the market
7969163 its over that but i dont know the exact numbers off the top of my head
7969164 internet advertising is currently growing at a compound annual rate of 18 3 percent and will reach 73 billion in 2011 what is really exciting about mobile advertising is its ability to eclipse internet advertising
7969165 if i could put a time schedule on that i would be the richest man alive but the amount of traction we are seeing is up across all fronts
7969166 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7969167 the clinton people here theyve said they wanted catharsis they wanted that roll call but they may not get it
7969168 they dont want to be blamed for any trouble at this convention
7969169 this is an area ripe for a major test case which may reach the european court of justice as courts across europe are not being consistent in their approach
7969170 respects copyright holders and takes copyright issues very seriously there is no need for legal action and all the associated costs
7969171 the prime minister is not trying to be coy about it in any way at all anymore
7969172 he more or less accepted that an election is going to happen
7969173 when the prime minister himself is talking that way you can pretty much take it to the bank that hes made up his mind that hell have to call an election very very soon
7969174 lart contemporain ne veut plus se contenter des innombrables mus es qui lui sont consacr s il faut d sormais quil aille forcer le public jusque dans les endroits o lamateur dhistoire de lart et de v ritable beaut pensait pouvoir en tre pr serv

7969176 saw a need to have a more international body of students and established exchange programs with new zealand the cook islands french polynesia and american samoa
7969177 bob was such an unusual visionary he said to people lets travel to the independent islands and talk to the prime ministers and presidents about nationhood
7969178 he was an incredible influence behind the scenes even before the hawaiian renaissance in the 1970s he already envisioned how and hawaiians could reconnect with the south pacific
7969179 bob was always there incessantly helpful with iconic efficiency grace and enthusiasm
7969180 there isnt one voter in 50 whose vote will change because the debate dove into the tall grass of who triggered the dissolution
7969181 i often joke with foreign interviewers and say that our level of human performance is second in the world
7969182 number one is north korea their performances are totally uniform and uniformity in this way brings beauty we chinese can do it too after hard training and strict discipline chinese achieve that as well
7969183 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks and no one can suffer any discomfort because of human rights
7969184 this caused me no end of worry one week i thought everything had been rehearsed completely without any problems but in fact they could not even stand in straight lines
7969185 you couldnt criticize them either they all belong to organizations some kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard and can put up with a lot of pain
7969186 we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month thats the reason our performers give such brilliant performances i think other than north korea no other country anywhere in the world can achieve this
7969187 you do not have a chance to talk back it is impossible to explain or reply and you cant say this opinion is not a good one so lets not listen to it so what can you do you must be clear headed
7969188 i dont talk to them very much i used to i recorded with them at one time but i dont talk to them a lot
7969189 sometimes i want to get out of the house to get away from my kids but i love my kids a lot i love my kids quiet time comes around 10 at night when i go to sleep its peace of mind things run smoothly at night during the day things are more rough
7969190 i started exercising and i started eating more of the right food and i started feeling better i just get up in the morning and say my prayers
7969191 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
7969192 regardless of their problems hes extremely concerned about the son and obviously as the mother of his children hes extremely concerned about where she is and he has no idea about how or why she disappeared
7969193 she never never never went in the water by herself
7969194 she would never even go in the pool she would stay with all of us wear a bathing suit but never go in the water
7969195 being part of a bowling unit it does not really matter who takes the wickets we have also got the knowledge and experience of andrew flintoff and steve harmison and they are always passing it on
7969196 we are all bowling for each other and the fielding has been fantastic which only gives the bowlers confidence hopefully we can seal the series on friday
7969197 we are doing everything well at the moment we are turning up on time turning up on form and hammering the training sessions the recipe for success is hard work and the boys are doing the simple things better than the other team but i am not going to go overboard we have not won the series yet
7969198 we can only apologise for a very poor performance people were rightly angry that they did not get a proper game
7969199 it is difficult to put a finger on what went wrong we have a number of injuries but that is no excuse we were just not good enough on the field
7969200 we have got to pick ourselves up and make sure our next performance is a lot better
7969201 one of the firemen called me and said the place was full of smoke
7969202 we fuss and fuss at people to get surge protectors and they do work
7969203 were fortunate we got the fire call if it hadnt been for that call there is no telling what would have happened to the building
7969204 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
7969205 when she became argumentative or she became forceful they said shes bitchy and there were comments about what she was wearing and how she looked sometimes from other women it was disgusting
7969206 women may look at what happened to hillary clinton and think absolutely not i am not going to put myself through that
7969207 but on the other hand i think back to how far women have come in terms of progress when my grandmother was born women couldnt vote and clinton had a very viable campaign and she almost won and by some accounts she actually did win there are now more women governors than ever before and those jobs can be springboards to making a run for the president
7969208 the next hillary clintons are out there strong progressive women who are working hard and looking to get elected
7969209 and for me being a young woman its incredibly inspirational for me to have someone like hillary clinton to look up to in the political process shes motivated so many of us and the sexist treatment of her by the media from where im coming from gave us all the more reason to fight
7969210 i think unfortunately for women that the presidency is viewed as a very masculine office because of its links to the military the fact that the president is the commander in chief its hard for some people to conceptualize a woman being in that position
7969211 there are still so many obstacles that have everything to do with gender there are those who still believe that they feel more comfortable with men in power even other women
7969212 after this it wont be so odd or weird for a woman to be such an exciting viable candidate for president
7969213 instead of just going for megabucks you just go to court to decide whats the truth and whats not
7969214 there is a straightforward difference between the statement of opinion and the perpetration of untruth
7969215 had he written a novel there would have been no case
7969216 nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity
7969217 its a very commendable approach but i have a very cynical view of human nature
7969218 i suspect that this strategy will be largely confined to people who are in the media themselves or dont want to be seen as greedy for seeking damages or where the issues of fact are black and white
7969219 it is a point but the reason for bringing these actions was that these things were lies
7969220 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7969221 the concept of independent scientific review has been in practice since the 18th century and is crucial to ensuring that ideas and proposed work are scientifically sound
7969222 this overhaul of the endangered species act would place the fate of rare species in the hands of government stakeholders who are not qualified to assess the environmental impacts of their activities
7969223 what if we allowed pharmaceutical companies to approve and distribute drugs without consulting the food and drug administration
7969224 the result would spell potential disaster for humans in this case the vulnerable party is our environment
7969225 never to my knowledge has there been such a concerted effort to bring the public together with the experts who hold the most knowledge about an area of human illness that accounts for more loss and devastation than any other
7969226 mental illness is so prevalent in our society estimated to affect as many as one in four north americans in any given year with one in 10 suffering serious chronic conditions
7969227 more individuals and families are speaking out today than ever before about the pain and loss caused by mental illness
7969228 we hope that people who are coping with mental illness their friends and loved ones and mental health professionals will all attend these forums to learn about the progress thats being made in understanding and treating mental illness and why there is reason for hope for improved treatments and even cures if research can continue to flourish
7969229 government funding for mental health research has remained flat in the united states and probably wont get better any time soon
7969230 but we cant wait for the government too many lives are at stake and we must not lose momentum in the pace of discovery weve achieved over the past two decades
7969231 but it pales in comparison to the honor ive had representing you
7969232 my private life has been lived in the public arena because you all got me started so young
7969233 i didnt always comport myself looking back the way i would have wanted to when bad things happened to me
7969234 the press the national press i dont care what they think i wish we could have done this in private because you know i dont know if i would have made it through a lot of tough times in my life without you guys i mean it sincerely
7969235 this is a guy who has as my mother would say a sixth sense this guys got it this guys got it hes going to make you proud
7969236 the first guy who looks at things from a perspective like no one ive worked with and ive been around a long time hes going to transform america and hes going to transform the world
7969237 this satellite will collect gamma rays from the most energetic regions of our galaxy and beyond
7969238 working in the research institutes building on ellis avenue in the late 1940s enrico fermi produced the first quantitative ideas on how cosmic particles could reach the enormous energies needed to produce these cosmic gamma rays it is wonderful to hear that nasa has decided to dedicate this satellite to him
7969239 because poverty is closely linked to undesirable outcomes in areas such as health education emotional welfare and delinquency we take child poverty seriously as a measure of childrens well being
7969240 the 9 most badass women of posted by mike on august 26 2008
7969241 the number one killer among people with kidney disease is heart disease just like in the rest of the population except that in people with kidney disease the heart disease exhibits an accelerated course
7969242 kidney disease puts a person at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease but it is often asymptomatic even as late as stage three
7969243 the more definitively we can characterize renal disease the closer we are to effectively treating both it and its comorbid conditions
7969244 because of how simple they look people hypothesized that trichoplax represented an early form of animal life other people thought they were just simplified cnidarians jellyfish and hydras
7969245 we wanted to figure out where they fit with other animals in particular the cnidarians the sponges and more complex animals
7969246 comparing its genome with other genomes can tell us what the basic molecular toolkit was in the common ancestor of all animals
7969247 if you want to understand the early origin and diversification of animals you have to infer this from the fossil record or the genome sequences of animals that lived and diverged early most of which didnt leave fossils
7969248 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
7969249 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature
7969250 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
7969251 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
7969252 it can make a gut as needed so it could be the original proto animal
7969253 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
7969254 when a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors they buried the information and continued the illegal practice
7969255 we take issue with the states characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement
7969256 this agreement affirms our actions and we are continuing to make full refunds to all affected customers

7969259 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
7969260 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
7969261 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7969262 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
7969263 this decision is inconsistent with numerous united nations security council resolutions that russia has voted for in the past and is also inconsistent with the french brokered six point ceasefire agreement which president medvedev signed
7969264 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
7969265 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
7969266 todays step by russia is completely illegal and will have no legal basis neither for georgia nor for the rest of the world
7969267 russia has made an extraordinary strategic mistake and has badly damaged its place in modern international relations
7969268 the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to change the borders of europe by force
7969269 the most important thing was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe to save the lives of people for whom we are responsible because most of them they are russian citizens
7969270 so we had to take a decision recognising the two states as independent
7969271 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg
7969272 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
7969273 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7969274 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7969275 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7969276 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7969277 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7969285 theres a powerful police presence here the chill of 1968 is in the air of denver
7969286 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
7969287 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave

7969305 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7969306 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

7969308 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7969309 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7969310 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7969311 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7969312 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7969313 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7969314 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7969315 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7969316 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7969317 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7969318 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7969319 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7969320 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7969321 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7969322 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7969323 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7969324 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7969325 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7969326 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7969327 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7969328 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7969329 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7969330 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7969331 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7969332 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7969333 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7969334 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7969335 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7969336 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7969337 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7969338 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7969339 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7969340 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7969341 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7969342 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7969343 no one works for someone we all just work together

7969369 intelligence imagination and cunning are all required here but not underhandedness i dont believe you need to be devious to succeed in fact i think being excessively political is a mistake i also dont advise turning yourself into a heartless machine if you have no humanity you will inspire no one and no matter how tough the game gets you are more likely to win it if you maintain your sense of fun
7969370 the most valuable employees are those willing to rain on your parade when its necessary willing even to rain on a parade they organized themselves encourage them to come to you even when they dont have a solution sometimes there is no immediate solution to a problem but you need to know what is happening anyway
7969371 the most important barriers you have to set up between yourself and the people you manage are social and emotional this is directly counter to one of the most common workplace clich s people who work well together are like families if your idea of yourself as a boss is somehow to be the head of the family or the respected older brother or sister i have one piece of advice for you get a life marry somebody make a family of your own just admit to yourself that once you hit higher management the people who work for you are not going to love you they may very well not even like you
7969372 its inevitable as you rise that you wind up managing areas of your organization that are completely unfamiliar to you most management books will tell you that the answer to this dilemma is to hire people who are smarter than you in those areas you know little about thats half an answer as far as im concerned of course you do that but its not that simple first of all how do you know theyre smart enough if you know nothing about their subject they only have to be a little bit smarter than you to seem really smart and how do you get these people to do what you want when you dont fully understand what they do my advice is dont insult the experts get some outside help instead hire a consultant you trust who can help you understand whether your people are doing the right thing dont hit them over the head with the consultant either use her discreetly just to keep yourself informed of potential problems
7969373 unless your boss is very very strong he is likely to have moments of paranoia as you gain power and he suddenly feels your hot breath at the back of his neck nothing is more frightening to most bosses than the idea that someone they have brought along might become their boss the mentor thinks he is the hare and youre the tortoise he may do wonderful things for you early in your career protect you teach you encourage you but if you catch up to him it can get really ugly mentor relationships often end in such train wrecks

7969376 though its contrary to some conventional wisdom about how to succeed i highly recommend having interests outside of the office interests that you can pursue without people from the office dont take so much work home with you that you look like a donkey at the end of the day whether its on your computer or in paper form you probably wont look at it anyway try to avoid the star trek language of executives which eliminates all emotion in favor of basis points leverage and click through rates make friends who have nothing to do with your organizational life and dont sacrifice your family for your job no matter how important

7969465 we have wrestled with this bus issue for some time
7969466 rye as a town is really long some kids are on the bus a half hour even 45 minutes if the child is involved in after school programs or sports and they have a doctors appointment they can get home too late we had a bus committee and surveyed parents the primary reason for the cars is because of the people at the last stops
7969467 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7969468 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7969469 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7969470 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7969471 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7969472 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7969473 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7969474 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7969475 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7969476 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7969477 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7969478 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7969479 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7969480 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7969481 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7969482 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7969483 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful

7969485 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7969486 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now

7969493 these guys were tough theres evidence that they could take down ice age mammals almost single handedly
7969494 they lasted longer than us evolutionarily and they had larger brains than us if anything if you call someone a neanderthal it should be a compliment
7969495 there are many different pillars that have been holding up this idea that neanderthals are stupider than our own species

7969533 we wish to note that because of the absence of accurate statistics there is no way to measure if in fact there is such an increase in offences committed by children

7969535 essentially children only constitute 1 29 of the total prison population sentenced and unsentenced

7969548 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7969549 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being

7969660 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7969661 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7969662 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7969663 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7969664 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7969665 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7969666 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7969667 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7969668 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient

7969780 following the pre quarterfinal bout against the uzbek boxer jitender got 10 stitches under his chin when the indian reporters came to interview him we requested them not to highlight his injury as it would have been difficult to get medical clearance for him even his opponent in the quarterfinal could have taken advantage of it
7969781 nobody mentioned his injury till the quarterfinal bout was over and we are thankful to the media contingent present there for the great favour it did for us and for the country
7969782 in the period between his two bouts he was given internal stitches and plastic surgery was done so that the injury would not be visible at the time of his medical check up
7969783 i was worried as it was a deep wound and chances were he would not have passed the medical check up but we got his surgery done from the best medical expert in beijing and it helped

7969807 what is the magic glue that sticks together consumers and google mini cooper and oprah and not others
7969808 the result of this quest led to a much larger question of how ideologies belief systems come to exist
7969809 once you look at a brand as a belief system it automatically gains all the advantages that enterprise strives for trust vibrancy relevance a sense of values community leadership vision empathy commitment and more with the seven pieces of primal code in place you have created a belief system and products and services that people can believe in
7969810 believing is belonging when you are able to create brands that people believe in you also create groups of people who feel that they belong
7969811 we all want to belong to something larger than ourselves that community can surround a product or service a personality a social or political cause or a civic community
7969812 what we call primal branding is the ability to make people feel better about your brand than another
7969813 where you come from is as important for people to know as what you believe and what your advantages are
7969814 it is crucial for everyone to have an understanding of who you are and where you come from it is the foundation of trust
7969815 creation stories usually embody the who and the why who the founder of any nation or organization was and why they started is important for people to know
7969816 the creation story is the crucial first step in providing answers to why people should care about you or your product or service
7969817 defining understanding and communicating your mission are critical to the success of your brand
7969818 these are all simple concise statements that embody hugely bold ideas the creed is the singular notion that you want people to believe
7969819 icons are quick concentrations of meaning that cause your brand identity identity issues and brand values to spontaneously resonate the nike swoosh
7969820 the simplest and often easiest icon to recognize is the company logo
7969821 rituals are touch points with your brand and ideology that might be made more pleasant more engaging enhanced simplified less frustrating or more fun
7969822 when large corporations merge they bring with them a collision of competing rituals
7969823 the truth is that the spirit of both companies is built in part around those seemingly unimportant rituals
7969824 these interactions with the customer can be flat experiences or they can serve as enriching touch points that excite consumers and intensify the brand experience
7969825 the real power is understanding how rituals can be tweaked and made more interesting more evolved or otherwise better suited to their purposes
7969826 part of saying who you are and what you stand for is also declaring who you are not and what you dont stand for
7969827 defining your pagans is important in defining who you are this can be difficult when marketers do not want to exclude potential customers and mass markets
7969828 all belief systems come with a set of specialized words that must be learned before people can belong
7969829 if you are a computer user you understand what it means to log on what a virus is and what it means to crash
7969830 therefore sacred words are not simply professional jargon but also bind people together as a group and are often crucial to working together effectively
7969831 many sacred words are invented constructions ipod iced grande skinny decaf latte
7969832 belief systems come with their own invented lexicon that has precious meaning for those who believe
7969833 all successful belief systems have a person who is the catalyst the risk taker the visionary the iconoclast driven to the brink may 07 who set out against all odds to re create the world according to their own sense of self community and opportunity
7969834 enterprise without a leader is like a headless elephant it may eventually get somewhere but only by destroying everything in its path along the way
7969835 first consumers invest themselves in your brand by purchasing products or services because they believe in them second they are willing to help convince others to belong finally advocates believe so strongly in the brand that they fiercely defend it against rivals
7969836 properly managed the primal construct can help you create a belief system that results in a group of evangelists committed to advocating for you through thick and thin
7969837 often the most overlooked group is the people inside your own organization if you cant get your employees to believe how can they possibly convince others to believe
7969838 building a sense of community is what belonging is all about
7969839 the primal code is all part of a narrative it is storytelling when pieces of the story are missing the story becomes less interesting people become less interested they feel dissatisfied and turn away
7969840 if oprah has a creed it is about self determination and personal growth
7969841 the sever pieces of primal code are a map or checklist that can help guide your efforts to create a brand that people can believe in
7969842 many firms still havent figured out their company creed or a statement that declares what they are all about
7969843 brands are active engagements that continually reboot themselves to keep the consumer wondering whats going to happen next
7969844 the first step in primal branding is to determine where your brand exists in the minds of customers
7969845 the origin story is the beginning of the brand narrative the start of the mission
7969846 when companies merge the origin story needs to be rebooted around the new corporate vision
7969847 the creed should answer the question why do we belong in peoples lives why should people care
7969848 the creed is a principle it is what the company is about
7969849 the responsibility is to make sure that in every way you are meeting the expectation of the consumer
7969850 the expression of what your product or service is about becomes concentrated and instantly communicated in your icons
7969851 icons can be as simple as your company logo or as discreet as senses like taste or smell icons can be the product itself
7969852 rituals are actions that involve how the product is used how the service is engaged where and how the consumer goes to shop and how the product is maintained returned renewed downloaded or updated
7969853 who are you not what are you trying to avoid who are you up against
7969854 what are the words that define your company or yourself what words resonate internally or with consumers what words help define who you are or what you want to become
7969855 finally you must find leaders the natural place to look within large organizations is to the founder chief executive officer or president
7969856 creating a corporate work culture that people can believe in is critical for employee enthusiasm work performance and efficiency it also motivates vendors suppliers lenders and others who come into contact with the organization establishing and promoting a working culture is critical when companies merge together
7969857 the result is a confused sense of mission blurred motivations loss of leadership disgruntled employees and apathy
7969858 using primal branding leaders can create and sustain a company and mission that people believe in
7969859 the essence of this belonging resonates in a refreshed sense of commitment trust empathy vision mission and values within the organization
7969860 building corporate cultures is one of the most vital tasks facing organizations today
7969861 brands are ideologies with their own universe of truths iconography history heroes and demons
7969862 the more pieces of code communicated to your public the stronger your cause organization product service or community
7969863 creating a world of believers means creating a group of people who feel they belong to your ideals and want to convince others of your cause
7969864 think of the things that means something to you they all come from someplace creation story they stand for something creed they are symbolized by a sign a sound a smell icon you do certain specified things regarding them rituals certain words evoke that experience sacred words you contrast that experience against other experiences pagans they have an individual whether real or fictional who is behind the whole thing leader its all about creating a sense of meaning
7969865 primal branding contains a web of relationships and inferences that bang at the drum of our emotional mind set

7969897 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god

7969899 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

7969908 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move westward
7969909 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled there are vast areas of woodlands lakes and dark forests
7969910 weasels and otters and raccoons are already well re establishing themselves
7969911 and the european moose elk is poised to move westward indeed elk are already relatively common in the czech republic
7969912 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
7969913 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
7969914 they decimate not only mice but also other small mammals and snakes and other egg thieves
7969915 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes
7969916 because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves
7969917 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
7969918 the main problem will be the clich of the big bad wolf in the minds of many people wolves can of course be dangerous to humans in certain situations generally when they are backed into a corner but they are generally no threat to humans
7969919 europeans generally are very mindful of the dire effects that humans have had on the environment over the centuries and they are for the most part happy to see the return of bears and wolves and other creatures after near extinction of those species
7969920 as more predators move in the balance of nature returns to normal and we see a reduction in rats and mice and rabbits
7969921 those small creatures form the diet of predators such as the german sea eagle which was the emblem of germany for centuries but which was driven to the verge of extinction by unthinking hunters
7969922 while searching for bat carcasses under wind turbines we noticed that many of the carcasses had no external injuries or no visible cause of death
7969923 if bats are killed in canada that could have consequences for ecosystems as far away as mexico

7969937 en estos casos suele tratarse de conflictos abiertos rupturas de pareja respuestas a un maltrato similar al que sufren
7969938 existe tambi n la mujer que en lugar de romper con la relaci n que no le agrada lo canaliza en violencia
7969939 esto se da mucho entre mujeres de edad avanzada a las que la idea de un divorcio les resulta impensable por ejemplo
7969940 la historia tiene casos de mujeres que envenenaron a sus maridos para quedarse con sus propiedades o que son asesinas sin m s
7969941 es cierto que hay maltrato psicol gico pero hay que demostrar que eso ha existido de forma continuada y que ha causado un da o no basta decir es que mi mujer nunca me deja ver el f tbol porque a veces el jefe tambi n nos machaca d a tras d a y no tenemos alteraciones psicol gicas
7969942 ellos tienen tanta verg enza como ten an las mujeres tiempo atr s y ahora mismo que muchas no lo cuentan ni siquiera a su familia hace a os cuando llegaban mujeres a denunciar maltrato apenas se las atend a ahora les pasa a ellos que sufren el mismo tipo de maltrato
7969943 dicen que ellas ponen denuncias falsas pero nadie cuenta porque esas cifras no est n desagregadas las que ponen ellos y no son ciertas y estoy seguro de que hay muchas porque se lo recomiendan sus abogados en 1966 se cre en zaragoza una asociaci n de maridos oprimidos en 1966 para que luego digan que los hombres no denuncian por verg enza
7969944 a m esto me lo hace mi mujer y le doy dos hostias que la mato
7969945 me anulaba como persona yo no val a nada todo lo hac a mal si limpiaba mal si cocinaba mal
7969946 es un t o es como un hombre estoy amenazado de muerte y a mi familia la ha agredido en ocasiones
7969947 a n hoy tengo sentimientos pero ella utiliza a los hombres los manipula por dinero por sexo ya no tengo confianza en m mismo y eso que estuve en tratamiento porque mi vida perdi el rumbo tuvimos los ni os pero nunca se port bien no ten a el rol de madre luego me oblig a hacerme la vasectom a ten a un esclavo a su servicio
7969948 se deje de ocultar una realidad que aunque sea en una proporci n m nina existe los hombres maltratados ocultarlo no beneficia a nadie
7969949 la que ejercen las mujeres tambi n es violencia de g nero s lo que ellas no usan el m sculo sino la cabeza pero tratan de hacer lo mismo
7969950 a veces se valora la violencia por el resultado la muerte por ejemplo pero la diferencia est en la motivaci n de la que parte esa violencia y el objetivo que busca es el significado y no el resultado lo que nos hace humanos en el caso de los hombres se busca la dominaci n permanente y para ello usan la violencia y en eso se encuentran legitimados
7969951 la ley no pena una conducta m s que otra sino que pena m s una conducta que es m s grave porque la violencia de los hombres se hace con cierto amparo social cuando los hombres matan la sociedad todav a no lo condena como es debido cuando matan las mujeres no encuentran ese respaldo social al rev s su conducta se considera antinatural fuera de los par metros patriarcales machistas que predominan
7969952 cuando son ellas las agredidas adem s se consideran culpables algo que no pasa en el caso de los hombres agredidos y ellas suelen hacerlo para cortar la relaci n mientras que en el caso de los hombres lo hacen para mantenerlas sumisas eternamente
7969953 puede maltratar el que tiene poder de lo contrario ser a como si el acoso laboral lo ejercieran los empleados sobre el jefe ser a il gico
7969954 los padres son los adultos tienen la fuerza f sica el dinero todos los criterios para elegir con libertad y sin embargo algunos se dejan pegar pero podr an evitarlo eso mismo pueden hacer los hombres en su mayor a no podemos confundirlo todo
7969955 no deben tenerla los hombres tambi n pueden llorar no hacerlo parte de la misma base machista eso tambi n tiene que cambiar
7969956 todo esto se hace de una forma extraoficial y no llego a saber muchas veces a cu les de mis hombres est n utilizando
7969957 yo claro colaboro porque es el cni y he optado por no preguntar
7969958 parece evidente que conf an en las posibilidades de obtener informaci n que tiene la polic a municipal por ser una polic a muy cercana a los barrios y que se trata de agentes que no despiertan sospechas entre los vecinos
7969959 pero s me he preocupado en averiguar cu les de mis agentes est n metidos en esto entre otras cosas por estar informado ante lo que pueda pasar en alg n futuro
7969960 s de algunos pero no s de todos y no s m s
7969961 me ha parecido interesante porque es una manera de formar a nuestros polic as en este tipo de actividades parto de la base de que mi obligaci n es colaborar en la lucha antiterrorista
7969962 un polic a municipal llega a saber muchas cosas sobre lo que pasa en el vecindario
7969963 el cni descubri que un islamista a quien daba por fugado a irak estaba viviendo en nuestra localidad y lo ten amos perfectamente localizado se llevaron una buena sorpresa
7969964 tanto la polic a como la guardia civil ha despreciado en muchas ocasiones la informaci n de nuestras bases de datos y han sido muy reacios a que podamos compartirlas con las suyas
7969965 pero deber an saber que nosotros estamos muchos m s pr ximos al ciudadano y que podemos ser de gran utilidad en muchas investigaciones
7969966 no sabr a decir por qu les interesan los chinos ni qu tienen que ver los chinos con la seguridad nacional
7969967 s lo s que como el cni debe de estar dividido en departamentos aut nomos por aqu vienen de vez en cuando algunos agentes que todo lo que dicen es somos los de los chinos
7969968 sabemos que las comunidades chinas son muy cerradas pero tambi n que se asientan en barrios donde suelen estar presentes los musulmanes son incluso rivales a la hora de adquirir locales y negocios
7969969 nos han facilitado informaci n de delitos o irregularidades que se estaban cometiendo que ha sido interesante para que nosotros intervengamos en estos casos se han limitado a darnos esa informaci n va a venir un cargamento ma ana en tal sitio hay determinados inmigrantes ilegales en tal domicilio como ellos ah no pueden actuar lo hemos hecho nosotros
7969970 s es cierto que ltimamente est n cambiando algunas costumbres
7969971 hemos tenido casos de grupos chinos en actividades relacionadas con el tr fico de drogas como es el caso del xtasis un negocio que hasta ahora no hab an tocado tambi n han comenzado a observarse casos de delincuentes chinos en pr cticas de secuestros express
7969972 los entramados econ micos de los chinos empiezan a ser muy poderosos y tienden a ramificarse cada vez m s en reas que pueden ser sensibles de nuestra sociedad porque buscan tener influencia
7969973 los chinos se mueven en muchos sitios y en muchos barrios donde la poblaci n es inmigrante son adem s eficaces en la falsificaci n de documentos y dado que son c rculos muy cerrados no me extra ar a que el cni busque informaci n en esos entornos en lo que afecta tambi n al terrorismo islamista
