1700000 todays mobile application developer is faced with the challenge of creating and testing applications that work on thousands of devices and with so many handsets in todays mobile marketplace time is of the essence
1700001 by joining forces with deviceanywhere connect dac partners like cascada are able to offer developers the opportunity to combine cascadas breeze platform with deviceanywheres award winning solutions to create the fastest most efficient means through which to develop j2me applications on real physical devices
1700002 in 2003 my office tried to see if we could reconfigure our system to do such a task
1700003 and after 12 months we stopped without a feasible solution
1700004 its old technology and you cant find a repairman who knows how to fix it
1700005 it also a neat way of figuring how not to get your salary cut
1700006 after making the decision to create the tattoo sourcebook i immediately began researching studios and websites that had access to different tattoo designs
1700007 i spoke to tattoofinder com owner lou bardach and he thought the sourcebook concept as i presented it was a fantastic idea but it wasnt enough he wanted to give an authoritative and informative introduction to the tattoo process and he couldnt have been more right nearly 2 000 designs and 40 different artists later the tattoo sourcebook was born
1700008 we approach these collaborative efforts first and foremost by focusing on our customers needs
1700009 we then look for innovative ways to leverage our assets and build mutually beneficial relationships with other companies oftentimes valuing our long term goals over short term monetary gains
1700010 our decision to work with tattoofinder was based on the incredible volume of traffic their site generates
1700011 as well as their solid ethical reputation as the leading source for high quality tattoo designs it takes time for a newer company to build a strong presence on the web and doing so generally requires a huge advertising budget we felt working with tattoofinder com in co branded content distribution was a good move for both parties we look forward to finding other creative ways to work together to enhance each others brand extend our reach and increase industry authority
1700012 the secret to our success is giving our visitors exactly what they want in the most clear direct way possible
1700013 what our customers want is great tattoo artwork and reliable information and my mission is to make this experience as easy and effective as possible its not some kind of seo trick or backroom dealings with search engines like google in fact its the exact opposite philosophy thats made us successful honesty tattoofinder com has become synonymous with top quality tattoo artwork and authoritative information about the tattoo process simply because thats what we offer nothing more nothing less
1700014 just as actual tattoos have moved beyond bikers and soldiers to rock stars and actors iconic tattoo imagery has gained influence just as aggressively
1700015 our artwork is a powerhouse resource not only as tattoo friendly reference to get inked but also for merchandise friendly advertising friendly and promotion friendly tattoo images while people fanatically tattoo their skin businesses are equally enthusiastic about tattooing clothing electronic devices advertising campaigns and sometimes their company identity
1700016 our customers are interested in fashion sports music and entertainment all industries with very strong ties historically and socially to the tattooed and tattoo culture in general from a marketing perspective its in our interest to build integrated long term business relationships with companies having good tattoo synergy we develop and foster these strategic partnerships through trust over time and with each party looking for new and creative ways to support and collaboratively promote each other
1700017 we could have simply licensed artwork to harpercollins for the tattoo sourcebook
1700018 but we saw an opportunity to work with them more closely to produce and promote a truly epic book we could have simply sold advertising space to inked magazine on our website but saw opportunity in the magazines high end print market we took a creative approach in both cases toward building solid long term business relationships that have benefited us benefited our partners and most importantly benefited our customers
1700019 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1700020 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1700021 energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1700022 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1700023 i cant believe you fact checked a fake ad from paris hilton
1700024 this partnership represents a tremendous opportunity for sprint and an exciting extension of our proven success with cinema

1700028 the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president over ninety percent of the time
1700029 john mccain supports bushs tax cuts for millionaires but nothing for a hundred million households hes for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar and for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas the original maverick or just more of the same

1700036 l et me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1700037 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and all this somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do
1700038 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of things they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1700039 now two points one they know they are lying about what my energy plan is but the other this they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 its like these guys
1700040 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their home work because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1700041 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1700042 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1700043 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1700044 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1700045 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1700046 now theyve either forgotten what colour platinum is or theyve decided that theyve tried their hardest to convince people not to buy the console so now its time to convince people not to buy the games as well by making them as fucking hideous as possible cheers larry

1700051 this is a club that should be in the top two tiers of english football
1700052 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within sub regions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk of increasing relative poverty and continued exclusion from quality primary health care services
1700053 unless discrimination against women and girls is addressed as part of overall strategies to improve child and maternal health high rates of maternal and child mortality will remain stubbornly entrenched

1700057 why does john mccain think its ok for 77 000 tons of dangerous nuclear waste to go through some 44 other states but yet too dangerous to go through his own home state
1700058 john mccain simply cant have it both ways when it comes to the nuclear waste issue its hypocritical and unfair that he supports running hundreds of shipments of dangerous nuclear waste through 44 states and sticking nevadans with 77 000 tons of it forever while at the same time saying hes uncomfortable with it going through his own backyard for even a day
1700059 john mccain is asking nevadans and the residents of 44 states to gamble with their safety yet its not even a bet hes willing to take for arizona
1700060 just like with subsidies hes against them except when it comes to nuclear power and so called clean coal john mccain wants to have his cake and eat it too on the nuclear waste issue hes all for moving thousands of tons highly radioactive waste through communities across the country except when it comes to his home state of arizona
1700061 before an expansion of nuclear power is considered key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1700062 we have always had an eye on reducing the environmental impact of the fair

1700066 dog fighting really is an underground world the professional fighters are very sophisticated and they take great care to make sure law enforcement doesnt find out about it

1700070 new microchipped passports designed to be foolproof against identity theft can be cloned and manipulated in minutes and accepted as genuine by the computer software recommended for use at international airports tests for the times exposed security flaws in the microchips introduced to protect against terrorism and organised crime the flaws also undermine claims that 3 000 blank passports stolen last week were worthless because they could not be forged in the tests a computer researcher cloned the chips on two british passports and implanted digital images of osama bin laden and a suicide bomber the altered chips were then passed as genuine by passport reader software used by the un agency that sets standards for e passports
1700071 six major world powers agreed monday to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer intended to defuse the dispute the united states said representatives of the five permanent members of the u n security council and germany decided in a high level conference call that irans lack of response to an incentives package aimed at getting it to halt sensitive atomic activity left them no option other than to pursue new punitive measures the united states said
1700072 oil prices plunged to a three month low monday briefly tumbling below 120 a barrel in another huge sell off after tropical storm edouard seemed less likely to disrupt oil and natural gas output in the gulf of mexico meanwhile gasoline prices continued their downward trend with the common price in tulsa falling 7 cents from the weekend crudes steep drop prices fell more than 5 at one point during the day dragged down other commodities and mimicked the big nosedives of the past three weeks also weighing on prices monday was a report by the commerce department that consumer spending after adjusting for inflation fell in june as shoppers dealt with higher prices for gasoline food and other items that fed investors expectations that a u s economic slowdown is sharply curbing u s demand for fossil fuels
1700073 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist
1700074 be not righteous overmuch neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou die before thy time
1700075 there is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved
1700076 i think its inevitable that there will be a lower standard of living than what everybody had always anticipated
1700077 remind me never to get this guy mad at me
1700078 what we would define as success this season is always a difficult question to answer
1700079 but it is clear there are two trophies we are focused on the premier league and the champions league
1700080 after that the fa cup but we will never go seriously for the carling cup again this year we will have the same philosophy on the carling cup
1700081 the premier league and champions league are the trophies we will fight for
1700082 cesc fabregas for example has already played in a fa cup final a champions league final and also now a european championships final so you cannot say he has no experience
1700083 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1700084 paris hilton pakt mccain terug in eigen spot en wil president
1700085 we have significant dollars in fannie and freddie but that doesnt mean were concerned
1700086 we feel very comfortable with this debt at this time

1700091 we want to give hope and belief to all our supporters ahead of the new season and we know we can only do that if we play our usual game full of quality
1700092 it is not wrong to call arsenal a young side still but it is wrong to call us inexperienced
1700093 cesc fabregas for example has already played in a fa cup final a champions league final and also now a european championships final so you cannot say he has no experience
1700094 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november

1700097 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1700098 competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated me since the age of 10 and 11
1700099 the olympics are a great forum for me to use to get my message out
1700100 we are moving 1960s screw machine technology into the 21st century and are very excited to offer this new platform to the industrial automation community

1700114 hey this motherfucker thinks hes gonna get his dick wet shes gonna get her giblets roasted everybody stop what youre doing and eyeball him her knowingly
1700115 1 buy a shitload of condoms get a small basket and buy 20 fucking boxes the big ones so it looks like youre stocking up for a health center dorm hospital or porn shop it may cost you hundreds of dollars but no one will believe youre buying all those for yourself and itll be years before you have to buy condoms again
1700116 i hate condoms though they smell weird and you can always tell the difference between condom sex funk and regular sex funk condom sex funk makes me think of how a tire factory might smell
1700117 yeah im getting some but im also a responsible ass adult that isnt trying to spread or catch anything because i love myself and maybe even my partner enough to put one on
1700118 im not really sure why i find this embarrassing because i am not a prude in any sense of the term in fact until i was a teenager and received my adult name my algonquin name translated to naked boy because of my predisposition to running around the house mostly or completely nude a predisposition that persists to this day much to the chagrin of those unfortunate souls that can see me through my balcony window
1700119 i do like to warm up with some coloring filling in those cool empty pages with a hard warm crayon fresh from the box
1700120 its an excuse to rediscover and reconnect with your childhood
1700121 youre messing about on bikes getting muddy and getting an adrenalin rush it gives you the same kind of visceral thrill you get from riding on a rollercoaster except its ramped up a notch because youre in control not just strapped in
1700122 theres a massive difference between riding a bike on a road and off road and people need to have the basic skills to ride off road terrain
1700123 putting it bluntly without those skills you could go straight over the handlebars
1700124 most people are afraid to use the front brake because theyre afraid of going over the handlebars but we teach people to use it a lot because it gives masses of control
1700125 when i go riding with my teenage sons they wear knee and shin armour if you fall off a bike youre likely to hit your knees or elbows and if youve got flat pedals its easy to scrape your shins on them
1700126 also if you go in front youll find yourself looking over your shoulder which means you might fall off yourself

1700134 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1700135 if we have everybody on board and nobody injured then okay but maybe we could do to take one more experienced player
1700136 we are not singing with that going on behind us
1700137 this is my song this is the way ive been singing it for 15 years and i feel like the fans will be confused if we change it up
1700138 you know at this point im comfortable in whatever they give me

1700145 about ten miles my dad said evenly i could only hear the scraping of plates from the silence i could tell the kids were impressed and viewed their dudley do right headmaster in a new light he was comfortable in his own skin my mom always told me stories jokingly about how dad was so much more rational how much more of a superior person he was to her the moral was always again jokingly but not really about how prone to emotion passion insecurity and weakness she was and how superior to all that my dad was i was always more like my mom however much i denied to myself and when she she told these stories she was not onlu putting herself down she was unintentionally putting me down brennans little brother still in hs i jealous when kory pulled an e break turn going seventy in the snow and snapped the neck of jacks robot baby from health class jack failed the class that mettallic wailing i still remember that mettalic wailing in the backseat and me trying to catch my breath he snorted up a line his nostrils twitched a little like a rabbit he wiped it and sniffled brennan wasnt into natural stuff for some reason brennan wasnt going anywhere im sure hed inherit his fathers lumber business one day and thtd be it lake placid for life jack would definitely get out chris would too im sure if only because of his entreprenurial spirit as evidenced by his pot dealing and he can still climb up about 5 11 id say anyway were walking into the approach that was the hardest part for rusty cause of his prostetishis whih made him get very sore and we came aross this skier that had fallen off of a ledge and landed on the trail how far did he fall one of the little voices asked about thirty feet my dad said hed broken both of his legs hed said hed been there for about a day he would have died if hock hadnt came across him my mom saidd in her best matter of fact voice but still came across as the bragging it was anyway we used rustys walking poles as splints and we dragged him out on my sleeping bag what he meant was that he dragged him out rusty with his prostethis had a hard enough time simply walking for him to be capable of pulling out a two hundred pound man how long was the approach
1700146 i felt really down i didnt want to do anything anymore i had never felt depressed before but this completely took over i should have been counting my lucky stars to be alive after the car accident but that feeling had wore off
1700147 i had a pressurised job but i found out quickly that i couldnt deal with pressure any more
1700148 i know when people look at me that there shouldnt be anything wrong with me i look fine physically but if people could only see inside any one of us is only a hairs breath away from depression
1700149 without the centre i dont know what would have happened to me and people like me it really is a lifesaver
1700150 they forget that these services are what keeps us going we can go to the centres and relax and forget about our problems for a while we also get to support each other in a fun and relaxed environment which is very important for people with mental illness
1700151 some of them are very nervous and anxious about the future this is bringing worry on them at a time when they really dont need it its tough enough to battle mental illness and then have an organisation that is meant to be caring withdraw services that are vital for vulnerable people
1700152 we have to do something we feel that things will only get worse our message to the hse is to leave us alone and dont take any more from us
1700153 we werent told a thing we started hearing bits and pieces and then services started to disappear weve been treated very badly
1700154 i suddenly realised that i was alone i couldnt deal with how i felt i felt very depressed about the whole thing
1700155 you make firm friends there and people look out for each other i found it really helped me when i needed somewhere to turn to
1700156 there is very little left but if that goes we have nothing at all there have been cutbacks everywhere

1700180 at a time when many people are watching the pennies its not surprising that the public have become tired of news about rock stars being odd and pampered celebrities holidaying in exotic locations
1700181 the fact that amy winehouse is seen as six times more boring than the economy this summer illustrates this perfectly

1700191 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1700192 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1700193 i feel this statement is warranted to put the facts in context given the media interest

1700476 the battle for wine amp love or how i saved the world from parkerization
1700477 battles over the politics of wine are more often fought on the ground sometimes literally where are the lines of the best growing zones drawn will society stigmatize wine or praise it how can consumers buy their favorite wines or discover new ones is wine made in the vineyard as the industry likes to claim or is it made in the lab and tested on focus groups for its consumer appeal at stake in these battles are not only the livelihood of those in the industry but also the prestige and the profits of an industry whose sales reach 25 billion in the united states alone

1700488 so that wonderfully ephemeral and elusive component of wine that particular expression of a precise time vintage and place vineyard that wine geeks seek that magic combination of grape sun soil and rain that thing called could be boiled down to this simple observation

1700497 the publicist will tell the the journalist the truth always
1700498 its not illegal for you to drink alcohol unless you are under five actually research suggests that children introduced responsibly to alcohol by adults go on to take a responsible attitude to it
1700499 most young people in the us and europe tend to binge drink once they attain legal autonomy and legal drinking age
1700500 the legal drinking age pertains to autonomous young adults who very often just do not have the maturity ie completed neurophysiology to handle the responsibility of being able to purchase and consume alcohol and in the process also expose their developing neurophysiology to damage
1700501 although traditionally southern european countries had a pattern of higher per capita consumption most of which was derived from daily consumption of wine with meals this is changing said joan villalb a medical doctor at the autonomous university of madrid for example daily consumption with meals is decreasing in spain and beer is the most consumed alcohol binge drinking particularly among youth on weekend nights has become a health and social issue in spain a process mirrored in other countries of southern europe he added
1700502 defining drinking behavior with absolute numbers and imprecise terms mislabels many drinkers it also both overestimates and underestimates the true risk the physical and behavioral effects of alcohol as well as the context and time interval it is consumed are more important considerations

1700561 i find myself in complete agreement with the internal foreign office document that was prepared as a brief for the home office on the subject of dr qaradawi which completely corroborates the stand i have taken on every single point
1700562 the abduction and killing of americans in iraq is a religious obligation so as to cause them to leave iraq immediately
1700563 he qaradawi is the leading mainstream and influential islamic authority in the middle east and increasingly in europe with an extremely large popular following and regular shows on al jazeera excluding qaradawi would give grist to aq al qaeda propaganda of a western vendetta against muslims and would undermine qaradawis counter terrorism messages qaradawi would be the first port of call when encouraging statements against terrorism and the killing of muslim civilians in iraq as requested recently by iraq policy unit he has repeatedly and authoritatively condemned terrorist attacks after 9 11 ball madrid beslan the bigley kidnapping and recently after the bombings in qatar as well as on other occasions
1700564 the truth is sheik qaradawi if i can think of a parallel that christians would understand is i think very similar to the position of pope john xxiii
1700565 non muslims and muslims alike to fail to understand the real nature of jihad fi sabilillah holy war for the cause of allah
1700566 might however listen to religious arguments about the nature of jihad that while anti western eschew terrorism
1700567 i presume there are opportunities for engaging in the debates on islamist websites unattributably
1700568 i am relieved i have now been completely vindicated in my actions exposing dangerous government policy and changing its priorities
1700569 given that islamist groups are often less corrupt than the generality of the societies in which they operate consideration might be given to channelling aid resources through them so long as sufficient transparency is achievable
1700570 we will continue to look for opportunities to talk to islamists here in egypt
1700571 for a year now we have been engaged with a dialogue with a small group of people familiar with some of the different national branches of the muslim brotherhood with hamas and hizbolllah they do not formally represent these movements but we believe that they do speak with authority
1700572 engaging with groups such as the muslim brotherhood will help increase our understanding of political islam generally as well as in the specific egyptian context incremental enhancement of contacts may help in discouraging radicalization
1700573 the idea is to promote british muslims overseas to try to get rid of the myth that british muslims are oppressed and to give muslims in the uk the experience of how muslims in other parts of the world live
1700574 to share their experiences of life in the uk and engage in constructive dialogue to increase mutual understanding
1700575 it is not foreign and commonwealth office policy to comment publicly on the employment contracts for individual members of staff nor on advice sought or not sought before offering a member of staff employment staff are recruited according to strict guidelines under free and fair open competitions

1700626 all that talk last week about david moyes betting suspended on him going and quitting im amazed
1700627 i am on the phone to him all the time and you wonder where all this comes from
1700628 it all seemed to come from the fact that we lost a game in america last week thats all of course no one is a good loser at everton we never want to lose
1700629 the real problem this close season is that apart from steven pienaar we actually have not signed any new players
1700630 i just want to pull off one deal just one of the transfers we have been chasing for the last six weeks
1700631 being one of the smaller clubs and thats no disrespect to us but i think once the bigger clubs start moving then the market tends to follow and things move on with it
1700632 one or two of the bigger clubs now have spent money and it just filters along then and the market starts moving
1700633 you need the bigger clubs at times to get the ball rolling and as soon as that happens then you find people start becoming available
1700634 we have been very selective in what we are trying to get
1700635 if we all believe in ourselves all believe in our team i am sure we can do anything
1700636 all you have to do is put your mind to it
1700637 considering we havent got a big squad i think it is quite good in a way that everyone can gel together we know how we play and it is easier when only a couple of players come in they can just settle in
1700638 were in contract talks now its been dragging on since the end of last season
1700639 the interview published in the sunday edition of the mirror and later circulated in the russian media is the result of a lack of imagination from a journalist or a publication
1700640 neither i nor any of my representatives have ever given this kind of comment and have had no contact with this edition
1700641 now my representatives will ascertain the cause and source of this kind of absurdity
1700642 he gets called my dad my granddad you name it
1700643 i get it all the time and im sure people think thats why im in the team
1700644 ive been there since i was 12 and maybe he took a special interest because i was scottish but i know when i signed it didnt matter if you were scottish norwegian or whatever if you are not good enough you wont get in the team
1700645 ive been in the youth team with a lot of scottish players a lot of scottish players have been there and i dont think the manager would have had the success hes had if he only wanted scottish players in his team
1700646 i get a lot of people saying im only picked because im scottish and thats fine its water off a ducks back people will say what they want there is nothing you can do about that
1700647 we can talk about scottish football but at the same time hes talking to ronaldo and nani about the portuguese game
1700648 he loves his football that much that he goes home and watches all these games he will talk to me about celtic and rangers and the scotland game but at the same time he will talk about sporting lisbons game
1700649 you can say what you want i never came to manchester united because alex ferguson is scottish
1700650 i came to manchester united because they were the best team in the premier league and alex ferguson was the best manager
1700651 jeroen van beek takes the passport of a 16 month old british boy and puts it on to a 40 smartcard reader the size of an ipod he punches a code into his computer and within seconds the information contained in the passports microchip appears on screen this is not supposed to happen as communication between the chip and the reader uses powerful encryption but a renowned british computer expert called adam laurie worked out how to crack the code 18 months ago on his computer mr van beek alters the cloned chip and removes the image of the child the times photographer michael crabtrees son thomas and replaces it with the image of osama bin laden he does the same with the passport of my partner suzanne hallam installing the image of hiba darghmeh a palestinian suicide bomber instead and if the chips had contained other biometric data such as fingerprints or iris scans he could have changed those too

1700659 the new record thrash speed burn was to re establish us as one of the pioneers of speed and thrash metal i guess it was a sort of reminder to younger metal fans where the whole speed thing came from not that we have anything to prove but the intensity of this record is evident and its honest we always try to get this freight train vibe like in our live performances it was the first time we have recorded in digital but the final product came out sounding garage old school i dont know if thats a good thing or bad thing some reviewers like the production some dont you cant please everyone our new singer kenny winter from brooklyn new york is a great addition to our line up i write the songs for the most part kenny s interpretation of the songs has added an exciting fresh angle in the exciter tradition the sales figures for this record since the release date are impressive and our record company massacre is quite pleased with the numbers

1700667 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well
1700668 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that

1700697 i think this hall is marvellous and offers a large variety

1700699 it provides the perfect atmosphere for film viewers indian movies have added real colour to the artistic building
1700700 i believe the exchange of movies can prove instrumental in sustainable peace between the two countries
1700701 this is a welcome step and both countries should liberalise their policies of exchanging movies dramas and songs its always good to see pakistani singers like atif aslam in kismat konnection singing for indian movies
1700702 he was the icon of peace and love among the people of the two countries

1700796 the current situation has started to create social disorder brought about by some hostile posturing both from supporters and opponents of the proposed muslim homeland
1700797 the situation on the ground points to more violence especially in central mindanao
1700798 we have complied with all the requirement the finances have been arranged so we dont see any impediment to the granting of the franchise
1700799 there are less and less stories about work farmers have disappeared from the newspapers labor issues are given less importance in newspapers
1700800 the media have the opportunity to keep up the debate and put pressure on the civil society to favor the adoption of fundamental standards and rights at work
1700801 our organization is a source of consistent information for those journalists to use to write up their stories or conduct thorough investigations into the world of work in their countries
1700802 the required two thirds vote of the senate is only 15 senators so we only need one more vote that wont be hard because the issue of constitutionality has already been settled
1700803 good luck sa kanilang lahat wag nilang kalimutang magdasal mag ensayo sila
1700804 nandito lang kami sa likod nyo nakasuporta at nagdarasal para sa karangalan ng ating bansa

1700806 isang dapat i consider dito its a tough fight for manny pacquiao hindi ito easy fight thats why were trying to get the best deal for manny for this particular fight
1700807 the required two thirds vote of the senate is only 15 senators so we only need one more vote that wont be hard because the issue of constitutionality has already been settled
1700808 so we at least already have 16 votes and thats more than two thirds
1700809 the result of the exchange of notes will be that all philippine constitutional provisions reserving certain economic activities to filipinos and to corporations 60 filipino owned shall prevail over jpepa
1700810 cancel the jpepa provision that japanese in our country would get national treatment meaning the same treatment as filipinos in investment activities
1700811 our national patrimony and natural resources will remain safely in filipino hands
1700812 under the vienna convention on the law of treaties art 13 an exchange of notes in effect constitutes a treaty in itself provided it states that the exchange shall have that effect
1700813 our constitution will prevail over the jpepa our constitution always protects filipino corporations that are at least 60 owned so that will stay
1700814 most important bilateral economic agreement in the last 50 years
1700815 agriculture and exports will be the biggest winners the treaty will immediately have a positive impact on farmers fishermen and food processors
1700816 japan has already concluded similar economic partnership agreements epas with singapore mexico malaysia thailand chile brunei and indonesia
1700817 japan is our biggest source of official development assistance oda which in 2006 already amounted to us 4 7 billion with jpepa oda will get even bigger
1700818 although there will be zero tariffs on 145 waste products they cannot come in because they are banned by r a no 6969 on toxic wastes and r a no 9003 on ecological solid wastes
1700819 japan would not be exporting wastes to rp in accordance with the basel convention
1700820 we believe in economic cooperation among countries such as through bilateral trade and investment deals but such cooperation must be founded on mutual respect and benefit the jpepa as the senate hearings themselves would show has grossly failed to meet this very basic requirement it is clearly a one sided deal there is no reason for the senate to ratify the jpepa and accept it in behalf of the filipino people

1700828 it is at least possible though its not certain that itll affect their vote
1700829 over time the percentage of people who have these conflicts will diminish
1700830 a lot of it will have to do with how much energy the fda is willing to expend to find people who dont have a conflict of interest
1700831 the fda has consistently used a very low standard for granting waivers and there is no evidence that this will change

1700952 uit verschillende onderzoeken naar voetbalvandalisme en ook uit een experiment in antwerpen is gebleken dat het ideale team bestaat uit een mannelijke en een vrouwelijke fancoach dat zal ook in gent het geval zijn wanneer in augustus 91 het project definitief van start gaat dat de vrouw het eerst is benoemd is gewoon toeval lieve is maatschappelijk assistente maar eigenlijk is er geen specifieke vereiste om fancoach te worden het voornaamste is dat die mensen gemotiveerd zijn dat ze kunnen omgaan met de doelgroep en dat ze voldoen aan een hoop eigenschappen omdat ze toch wel een heleboel diverse taken op zich moeten nemen laten we er geen doekjes om winden als er vechtpartijen zijn wordt er alvast van de mannelijke fancoach verwacht dat hij er tussenkomt en dan zal hij onvermijdelijk ook af en toe klop krijgen natuurlijk op een vrouw gaan ze normaal gezien echter niet slaan buiten die fysieke aanwezigheid op het veld ook bij uitwedstrijden is er nog de home werking een soort van kantine waar ook bepaalde activiteiten kunnen plaatsvinden en een zekere hulpverlening waarmee ik bedoel dat die gasten weten dat ze op de fancoaches kunnen rekenen ook de leeftijd speelt toch niet zon belangrijke rol al moet je daar natuurlijk niet als oude tante van vijftig gaan staan maar toch is een vrouw daar op haar plaats omdat er binnen die sides een macho cultuur heerst die toch voor een stuk wordt doorbroken als een vrouw daaraan meewerkt ik zeg wel voor een stuk want voor de rest is het eigenlijk toch een puur mannelijke wereld ze hebben bijna allemaal wel een lief maar die mag gewoonweg niet meekomen naar de wedstrijd tenzij als het een rustige wedstrijd betreft tegen k v kortrijk of zo niet dat de meisjes schrik hebben maar de jongens vinden gewoon dat ze daar niet thuishoren

1701075 they would not have been caught had it not been for the publics assistance i would like to thank them and encourage them to continue to help us with this vexing problem
1701076 i would like to thank the police the defence force and immigration department for certainly a job well done particularly the humanitarian actions taken by them towards the illegal immigrants
1701077 you must always remember that although persons come here illegally they are coming here because of depressed circumstances in their home and they are to be treated with respect they are to be treated with the utmost dignity
1701078 as this is perhaps one of the best ways for us to deal with this illegal immigration problem

1701080 we taught the kids where to find fish where the fish habitat would be the kinds of fish that we would find in ohio
1701081 we did these hooked on fishing lessons with the kids
1701082 and we likened addiction to a fish being hooked and how it was real difficult when you got hooked to drugs to get off drugs
1701083 the fishing trip was a culmination of all that we had been doing
1701084 this year we decided wed go with this program and see how it would go this year and it seemed to go off pretty well with the kids
1701085 we want to thank everybody who maintained their support we want to thank the citizens and members of the highland community for the trust they put in us and the belief they had in us were excited about going forward with this new endeavor

1701095 it seems to me that those people who attack feminism are the ones who dont have a proper understanding of it i have yet to have an intelligent conversation with someone who despises feminism and has a good grasp of what it entails
1701096 the way addiction is discussed in these conversations seems cursory at best and decidedly lacking in compassion understanding theres this vibe that people who have never dealt with drug addiction can just use the words and well all understand the pathos that this entails the desperation the despair the last gasp i mean weve all seen leaving las vegas drugstore cowboy walk the line whatever

1701098 it would be simpler if this case was just about the issue of jeffersons bisexuality but it isnt

1701100 that these professional anti porn activists who make good livings off their writing speaking and teaching activities toward the suppression of freedom of expression would choose to go underground with their despicable propaganda is hardly surprising they have a lot to lose by risking the kinds of criminal sanctions pornographers must contemplate every day on the job that unlike lawful pornographers stop porn culture cant comply with the the requirements of 2257 because theyve stolen the copyrighted material they employ has clearly put their own freedom in jeopardy as opposed to merely jeopardizing the freedoms of consenting adults as they would prefer to do that it would seem has given them some pause
1701101 gracie is not a persona but once a sex worker even if not always a sex worker youll either always have a double life issue or end up simply denying your past i cant wont do the latter but often i have to compartmentalize my own life into sex worker and non sex worker

1701105 victimization may not only reinforce the negative self concepts that a risk factor for victimization such as obesity may cause but a risk factor for victimization such as obesity will also make it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized indefinitely in other words the risk factors that strengthen the links in this pathway will also keep the pathway intact because it is also a risk factor for being victimized
1701106 the current study suggests that a risk factor for being victimized such as obesity may play an important role in the long term effects of victimization by making it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized over the long term but also that victimization can reinforce the negative self perceptions that the adolescent already has
1701107 it is important to go beyond using obesity as a predictor of long term adjustment and examine the processes and experiences of obese individuals that might cause depression or changes in health
1701108 we dont know how many people will be coming over

1701119 what ive seen so far is that everything looks real good the contractor did a real good job with the concrete we have many bridges were going to look at today thats really all the contract was for rehabilitating the old railroad structures along the trail
1701120 we have had approximately 13 bridges rehabilitated on this trail recently by our contractor crawford construction
1701121 the project was paid for by the ohio department of transportation by their enhancement grant program
1701122 users of the trail and that could be bicyclists walkers or hikers will notice there is new concrete on most of the bridges that exist on the trailway
1701123 this trail is a very important linkage on what is known as the ohio to erie trail when its completed it will be a 453 mile trail running from the ohio river to the shores of lake eire we will see folks from all over the country coming through knox county on their trek to the great lakes and when they do they will certainly enjoy the hospitality that we here in knox county enjoy every day
1701124 between centerburg and mount vernon there will be several parking lots where people can easily access the trail
1701125 we call these trail heads where there will be paved parking areas and other recreational ammenities such as perhaps picnic tables pinic shelters and tables there will definitely be one in mount vernon
1701126 there are a number of countries that have told us unofficially that they will be signing there are some countries that have been silent but we see no reason why we should believe that they are not signing
1701127 if its national consultations include the major producers sugar rice fisheries forestry products and on the basis of their input a decision is made i see no reason why guyana will not sign because it is in the interest of all those industries to have epa market access
1701128 we were the last the cariforum group was the last grouping to conclude an agreement with the europeans last year nobody else concluded any agreement after cariforum concluded so it is not that we did it and the others had to follow suit all the others were doing it
1701129 mrs jeffers is well suited to lead our tourism authority as we strive to develop a more proactive organization that is focused on the competitive needs of the marketplace as well as the needs of our tourism stakeholders and local people
1701130 her entrepreneurial spirit combined with her extensive knowledge and understanding of our islands tourism product are qualities that will be invaluable in her position her appointment is further evidence of our governments commitment to empowering local people and cultivating local leadership in the tourism sector
1701131 my administration is committed to giving carriacou and ptit martinique a fair share of development and to provide the environment for businesses to succeed and make their contribution to the nation
1701132 maybe its time to do some more work on the airport at this time
1701133 the fact is that we cannot continue with the sand mining when we are facing this problem it must stop because all the evidence point to a level of erosion that is undermining our tourism potential

1701140 im not a favourite and that doesnt matter im never a favourite in my eyes in training
1701141 i know usain is the world record holder but ive got to look at tyson
1701142 he knows how to run those rounds and has run fast times at the end of those rounds
1701143 two million of this money will be made available shortly and after a review of the details by the ministries of finance and legal affairs the remaining 5 million will be available 12 months thereafter
1701144 the pictures could have been taken as she was walking by
1701145 lisaraye is still married and would not do anything to compromise her situation
1701146 asafa powell right beside me is the second fastest man in the world and tyson gay is the world champion and hes running really fast and hell be up there so its all about whos got the perfect race
1701147 if i get a good start i know im going to do well so its pretty much how i react in the finals
1701148 my game over the 200 has got very good over the years i think im maybe 95 percent there and one day ill get the perfect race
1701149 it would feel good to win any olympic gold but im definitely going out there hoping i win both
1701150 a world record can go at any time but olympic gold lasts forever
1701151 olympic gold is closer to my heart than anything if i run 19 98 and i win im going to be happy as long as i win im going to be happy
1701152 i knew i could i be a good competitor but i guess im faster than i thought
1701153 i know im clean so i pretty much just do what i do
1701154 i hope he gets better because if i want to be the best i have to beat the best
1701155 so tyson gay needs to be in that race so i can say im olympic champion 100 percent

1701161 a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy lasting more than a few months
1701162 theres no way the economy is not in recession with retail sales down with durable goods down with payrolls down
1701163 we really try to stick to the science and not think about the politics
1701164 ive never been aware of any politically motivated views within the committee to change the timing of our work

1701166 speculators or more accurately financial investors are no fools just as in any other financial market so in the market for oil they are a consequence and not a cause of the tight underlying situation
1701167 they financial investors invest where they see good opportunities and divest where they see demand falling short of supply and therefore expect prices to fall
1701168 investors follow expectations which are following real developments and real production and consumption numbers

1701174 they canadian health officials are picking and choosing people my liver is shot because i took hiv drugs to save my life and now i am denied a live saving operation
1701175 there is 15 years experience in other parts of the world and if a patient is selected wisely the survival rate is similar to those who dont have hiv
1701176 some say an hiv patients immune system would be compromised and the anti rejection medication would make them sick this is not the case and has been proven over 15 years
1701177 very soon mud is planning to begin full scale operation of high powered wells in its massive new platte west well field located in western douglas county
1701178 if mud begins full operation at this time it will place the drinking water of the omaha area at risk
1701179 we now know the threat is not actually contained and it is clear the corps doesnt know how far east the contamination extends
1701180 in light of this it is far too risky for mud to operate its massive new well field at this time
1701181 the permit issued to mud by the corps in 2003 acknowledges that the pumping could cause the contamination to move and get into the drinking water
1701182 instead of instructing mud to delay operations until the toxins are contained they are allowing mud to proceed
1701183 theyll let us know if there are any problems and if there are they will be corrected
1701184 it is very troubling that the corps continues to refuse to test all the residential wells in the vicinity of the eastern plume
1701185 the public does not have a network of monitoring wells that could serve as an effective early warning system to alert them when muds pumping draws the contamination farther east
1701186 neither the state nor the epa has conducted a study of the effect of muds maximum pumping reported to be at 160 million gallons per day when the stream flow in the platte river is low
1701187 neither have they conducted any independent groundwater modeling related to the mead supefund site toxins
1701188 i live so far below my means that it doesnt really register
1701189 in one fell swoop i pay for the roof over my head the food in my stomach and the lights to read by thats a big advantage
1701190 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
1701191 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
1701192 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
1701193 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
1701194 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
1701195 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
1701196 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
1701197 teachers are different here theyre extremely patient pay attention to you and your problems and give you as much time as you need if they see some potential in you
1701198 i cant say for example how many of them are roma or without parents this isnt important and these categories are also useless how do i categorize someone who officially lives with his parents but in fact has not seen them for years and lives alone
1701199 there is a huge group of young people who are invisible and cannot be reached because all their institutional connections are broken when they drop out of the last school
1701200 there were times when i was the only one in the class because the teacher was willing to work with me one on one we covered one history book in a week and i passed the final exam with good results
1701201 in bt teachers understood that i wasnt stupid just because i thought differently slowly i was able to forget the years of humiliation in my previous schools
1701202 once the math teacher explained the same thing six times to someone in the group the whole class was tired of it but the teacher was patient even the sixth time at a normal school that student would have been told to go and take private classes in the afternoon and labeled as stupid

1701207 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes

1701247 capitalism came before democracy essentially everywhere except in this country where they started at the same time
1701248 in the rest of the world it took 100 200 300 years before they got to where they could manage a democracy

1701352 detroit had been home both to the machine and to the spiritual it was in detroit that the fire belching machines of the great industrial plants like river rouge existed together with the equally fiery passions of rhythm and blues here visions of automobile bodies of steel in the clanging workshops of auto factories by day used to give way to soundscapes of soul music by night body and soul machine and spirit detroit was the place where opposites clashed and were transcended

1701372 what has passed away is a certain kind of revered and influential critical voice it is sometimes said where are todays equivalents of the poet and critic william empson the art critic clement greenberg the critic of the novel fr leavis
1701373 classical music criticism a high minded endeavor that has been around at least as long as newspapers and reached an english language peak with george bernard shaw has taken a series of hits in recent months critics jobs have been eliminated downgraded or redefined at newspapers in atlanta minneapolis and elsewhere around the country and at new york magazine where peter g davis one of the most respected voices of the craft said he had been forced out after 26 years
1701374 it may be hard to imagine given our current obsessions with television shows movies instant messaging facebook and blogs but literature was once at the center of american cultural life
1701375 while presenting organizations might be characterized as real time engines of social aggregation many younger audience members are meeting their needs to connect and communicate in virtual counterparts like myspace the internet is not only a channel for information and entertainment it is an interactive forum within which participants are socialized and acculturated in addition to being informed and entertained many presenting organizations are novices at encouraging or facilitating these virtual networks to cross the chasm from the virtual to the real to move from the electronic to the analog experience of the real in real time and together
1701376 junior critics and reporters or those working for marginal outlets like now the blogs to which i contribute can expect dismissive treatment from most press agents who spend much of their time fending off requests for free tickets
1701377 no jesus is the fully authoritative interpreter of the torah
1701378 now linked with the book are assessments of biblical exegesis that make one prick up ones ears

1701383 christians after easter spoke of jesus more affirmatively that is to say they said greater and more important things than the historical jesus would have said about himself this value plus of post paschal christology in respect of jesus pre paschal self awareness whether on the historical or on the objective level is based on the actual event of easter
1701384 this interpretation may be profound and in keeping with benedicts christ centered message it is not many scholars would say historically accurate
1701385 the fact that jesus trial was presented to the romans as the trial of a political messiah reflects the pragmatism of the sadducees
1701386 take this conviction of faith as our starting point for reading the texts with the help of historical methodology
1701387 the aim unequivocally is not to give up serious engagement with history
1701388 the historical critical method is and remains an indispensable dimension of exegetical work

1701397 soaring oil prices will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as 79 billion by years end according to an american federal oversight agency but iraq has spent only a minute fraction of that on reconstruction costs which are now largely borne by the united states the unspent windfall which covers surpluses from oil sales since 2005 appears likely to reinforce growing debate about the approximately 48 billion in american taxpayer money devoted to rebuilding iraq since the american led invasion
1701398 to date interoperability between law enforcement agencies in the united states fails to exist copsync fulfills the interoperability role through the deployment of its proprietary software
1701399 the copsync software is an overlay technology that can be deployed without jeopardizing existing vendor relationships additionally copsync inc s method of data integration will bring existing vendors into compliance with federal mandates established after 9 11 copsync tm provides critical and life saving information in real time to notify warn and protect officers we call it electronic body armor based on our ability to create immediate information sharing at the point of incident many of the texas sheriffs requesting agency demonstrations stated that they would assist in getting other jurisdictions to attend our meetings especially those located within their county
1701400 as a law enforcement professional myself it is very exciting to know that 51 texas sheriffs have stepped up to the plate and made a conscious decision to bring their respective agencies into a new age of law enforcement
1701401 law enforcement in our nation cannot continue to operate in a one off mode of information data collection and storage this group of texas sheriffs who made the decision to request our presence at their location is truly representative of the fact that law enforcement is ready to move forward into an age where criminals can no longer hide beyond jurisdictional boundaries i am proud of the fact that texas law enforcement agencies are not only supporting information sharing but aggressively seeking out solutions to create information sharing
1701402 for more than 50 years san juan has been a very successful market for delta and today is the destination with the highest number of flights and passengers for our airline in the caribbean basin
1701403 the cinemagic theatre in burnsville truly represents a modern movie experience and our ronincast digital signage is a great addition to the beautiful ambiance of the environment
1701404 wireless ronin has been great to work with and consulted with us to best enhance our environment with visually stimulating displays you would expect from a cutting edge movie theatre
1701405 the flexibility of the ronincast software allows us to use the signage in a variety of ways using existing resources such as our pricing databases and reallocating movie trailer videos
1701406 some people especially young people are able to further their psychosexual development i
1701407 throughout most of christian history the vast majority of theologians who wrote about sexuality tried to approach the subject from one direction only they began with affirmations and assertions of the faith from scriptures from doctrines from churchly teachings and so on and then applied those to human sexuality now theologians are assuming that the other direction of inquiry is important as well what does our sexual experience reveal about god about the ways we understand the gospel about the ways we read scripture and tradition and attempt to live out the faith
1701408 the body of the faithful is one of the witnesses to the fact of the tradition of revealed doctrine and their consensus through christendom is the voice of the infallible church
1701409 dogmas of tradition exist not as truths complete in themselves but rather as resources for helping us discover the ever greater glory of the god whose gift of self pervades all possible experience

1701414 prone to exaggeration and on occasion deliberately manipulated by insurgents for propaganda purposes
1701415 militants want civilians caught up in the fighting because they think this will undermine support for nato isaf in afghanistan and in the international community
1701416 the evidence is also pretty clear one weve had progress on civilian casualties and two by and large people have responded very well when we have these rare incidents particularly in the canadian case
1701417 the local people the civilians are so angry they are so angry so mad at foreign forces
1701418 they want the international community coalition forces and nato to stop killing and be very careful and during operations to separate taliban and civilians
1701419 the representatives of the people in the afghan parliament they are also blaming foreign forces and especially the government of hamid karzai saying why the government could not stop these foreign forces from killing civilians
1701420 we are hearing that if a family is killed definitely a brother or another person of their family will join taliban because they were killed by foreign forces
1701421 they think air strikes are killing people and they should be brought to justice they should be punished
1701422 the people of canada should force their government especially canadian forces in kan dahar to be very careful in doing operations and not to believe in every intelligence report most of their intelligence reports are wrong so during an operation they should be very careful
1701423 casualties inadvertently caused by isaf forces as we have seen in the past few weeks have a detrimental effect on the mission because they have the potential to weaken public support which has so far been very strong but could be undermined
1701424 the insurgents and those who bring violence to us are looking for the cracks in public support and for a loss of morale that is what we should deny them
1701425 the politicians here are accessible its important to let them know your views
1701426 all the embassies the other ambassadors are very good they have really great souls
1701427 it was good for me very good exposure to become acting high commissioner because it is a big job
1701428 the main goal of representatives is to extend on the main relationship
1701429 we are selling bangladesh and representing close to 150 million people its a big job
1701430 when i go to toronto and meet with political leaders they are always happy with bangladeshis because they are so amicable
1701431 bangladeshis are very much flexible in their thoughts and actions and its made our task easier

1701436 this is a man i had always wanted to see
1701437 it is just too bad it was only after his death
1701438 both continued pressure on the media businesses as well as the recent sale of assets and outsourcing of operations
1701439 traditional media are facing a secular shift as a result of changes in consumer behavior and the migration of advertisers to new platforms
1701440 this has created a challenging environment for our print and tv businesses which has been compounded by the current macro economic climate
1701441 will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1701442 given the challenges facing the industry we expect to take actions to maintain our capital position above the mandatory target capital surplus
1701443 we continue to review and consider other alternatives for managing our capital including issuing equity in amounts that could be substantial and materially dilutive to our existing shareholders
1701444 increase our capital requirements limit our portfolio and new product activities increase our affordable housing goals or limit our ability to attract and retain senior executives
1701445 the strongbow tenements are known to host extensive paleochannels airborne radiometric mapping has shown areas of enhanced uranium associated with these paleochannels the holes will be radiometrically logged and samples of any radiometrically anomalous zones taken for chemical testing it is expected that these holes will delineate the most prospective areas and focus further drilling
1701446 at law camp you do mock trials and they take you for a day at the court one of my favourite parts of law camp was when they showed us my cousin vinny they said heres what its like to be a lawyer when my favorite part of law camp was watching my cousin vinny i realized maybe i dont really want to be a lawyer maybe i just want to act like a lawyer
1701447 there were some internal discussions the reality being that judd is somewhat against marijuana use and i think it should be legal we didnt really want to make a strong overall message about it we kind of wanted to leave it to the audience
1701448 i also have to let go because theres an aspect particularly after the success of things i noticed my narcissism got dialed up
1701449 suddenly for a minute i felt like everyone needed to take a knee and listen to what i had to say because i f kin made it and my way works and all this stuff
1701450 ive just stopped marinating in all the iron man lore that i didnt know and im sort of firing up the chainsaw and ready to attack it
1701451 youre writing for robert downey jr so at the end of the day thats an enormous amount of fun
1701452 im into it im excited to do another iron man right
1701453 at capistrano ford we are very excited about working with pro motors group corp to get the word out about the hydro assist fuel cell
1701454 we believe the current valuation of virtual radiologics common stock makes the repurchase of our equity a compelling investment for the company and will enhance shareholder value
1701455 having 30 million in cash on hand and a growing business that is generating excellent cash flow allows us to invest in virtual radiologic stock as well as other strategic initiatives
1701456 a lot of people are essentially writing off the stock market but were seeing some subtle signs of support
1701457 theyre really the leader of on demand software in which in a nutshell you basically log in go online and the softwares all there
1701458 we achieved record oil and gas production revenues cash flow from operations and net income for the second quarter of 2008
1701459 for the remainder of 2008 and beyond we are very excited about the prospects for continued strong production growth in our oil fields in california as well as significant increased production from our gas holdings in wyoming
1701460 we have recently increased the number of drilling rigs in both california and wyoming we remain very positive about the long term outlook for these large high quality assets
1701461 we have a high level of confidence that we will resolve our wtu environmental and zoning issues in california in a timely manner
1701462 stuart brings proven success managing eda operations in japan a great benefit for magma
1701463 i expect his experience will help our japan team achieve even greater success
1701464 it is exciting to join magma at a time when the companys new products are setting the stage for market expansion
1701465 talus finesim and the titan platform are delivering excellent results and i expect they will demonstrate good traction as the japan market moves toward more enhanced technologies
1701466 im the first to admit that the last few weeks have been crazy but im not out of control i do need to get out of london for a while to relax clear my head and sort things out though

1701469 as reported in june the sudden and dramatic drop off in our sales beginning memorial day weekend caused us to withdraw our previous sales and earnings guidance for the fiscal year
1701470 as a result of the current environment and in order to enhance profitability we have decided to temporarily slow our store growth
1701471 while this is clearly a difficult environment for us we remain confident in our superior consumer offer and our long term growth opportunity
1701472 increasing fears in u s business and strategic circles about china
1701473 giving india anything less or insisting that it cap or scrap its nuclear weapons is seen by washingtons neo conservatives as tantamount to strengthening china in the emerging balance of power in asia
1701474 contains some of the most comprehensive labour provisions to be found in any agreement anywhere in the world
1701475 the agreement itself should ensure that deals on labour and the environment exceed the template of the north american free trade agreement in order to set a higher standard for future negotiations
1701476 trade agreements must provide strong protection and enforcement mechanisms to ensure such abuses do not occur however evidence was brought forth by expert witnesses who confirm the weaknesses of the environmental provisions side agreements
1701477 key environmental obligations and a framework to undertake environmental co operative activities
1701478 to submit a written question to either country regarding any obligation under the agreement
1701479 for a government that promised accountability this is woefully inadequate
1701480 the government knows how to create truly independent and rigorous enforcement and investigatory schemes if it wants to
1701481 id just like to see more evidence that countries like canada and its trading partners were working more toward harmonized environmental rules and that everyone is living at the same environmental baseline
1701482 at least the information becomes public whether somethings done or not and maybe it will incite them to change the system and they themselves will go back and change this
1701483 its hard to be formed into a union in colombia and theres been a systematic campaign of de unionization
1701484 people have actually less rights than they did a decade ago so i found it a very sobering week i just think this needs to come out into the open its not just about investment its about who canada is singing agreements with i think theres some goings on in colombia that would shock most canadians
1701485 probably the most comprehensive labour agreement ever negotiated by canada
1701486 we are raising the bar with regard to the core obligation in the agreement and also providing for an open and robust dispute resolution mechanism with financial penalties if obligations are not respected
1701487 rather than sort of nanny its more effective to work with them on their own process to develop regulations
1701488 i think with this government were taking more of the approach of trying to work with them
1701489 todays decision will strengthen the international non proliferation regime by placing additional civilian nuclear facilities in the worlds largest democracy under international monitoring
1701490 indias rapidly expanding economy has an increasingly large demand for energy canada recognizes the need for india to employ clean energy solutions if we are to truly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
1701491 a vibrant democracy that shares our values of freedom democracy human rights and the rule of law
1701492 consider this issue with an open mind in the international atomic energy agency and the nuclear suppliers group
1701493 if the nuclear suppliers group agrees to exempt india from its guidelines canada will pursue nuclear co operation with india which would provide substantial commercial opportunities for canada
1701494 this government has a habit of lining up all their ducks then signing off things then letting people know after the fact
1701495 when they say they have no intentions or presently theyre not engaged at the top level the question of course is whats happening on the ground and what have the bureaucrats been directed to do
1701496 very bad news from the perspective of those who are really opposed to the u s india deal
1701497 we now have several states outside the nuclear non proliferation treaty who are declared nuclear weapons states
1701498 and the world is taking very unique and different approaches to each of these countries
1701499 so we have a treaty that has addressed issues of both disarmament and non proliferation and what we have to do is strengthen it not undermine it
1701500 the u s india deal rewards a country for thumbing its nose at the nuclear non proliferation treaty regime
1701501 arguably one of the most significant measures ottawa can take in showing india that it means business is re examining the nuclear relationship
1701502 theres been no progress getting them on board it gives us a chance to inject some new fresh air into the relationship
1701503 canada has to come up to the plate pretty quick
1701504 it would behoove canada to promote its position because canada and india are very interested in trade with each other
1701505 canada and india are just warming up after the past falling relations we had for different reasons
1701506 its like an engagement which will not turn into marriage if we dont work with india on this one we need to show our good faith in this
1701507 the tournament just started and this was a good result
1701508 now we need to have a good preparation to play against brazil and germany
1701509 our game plan was to match them speed for speed and skill for skill
1701510 but unfortunately that didnt happen our game plan didnt work today
1701511 the canadians have been telling us and telling the whole world that their seal hunt is the most humane in the whole world
1701512 well they should have no problems fulfilling this criteria then should they realistically
1701513 thousands and it is true thousands of private citizens and welfare organizations who expressed severe concern about the seal hunting
1701514 this is a very very emotional issue both in the eu and in traditional sealing nations such as canada greenland namibia russia
1701515 what the commission has tried to do is take the emotion out of it and go back to fact
1701516 we think that is a subjective word in our legislation we use the word avoidable pain distress and suffering because these are quantifiable you can quantify how much pain you can quantify how much distress you can quantify how much suffering humaneness means nothing
1701517 we accept that this is a traditional way of life and therefore we are prepared to give them an exemption because its a question of sustainability of very vulnerable communities
1701518 if you like in a way we have had to choose between human beings and animals
1701519 what it says is we want to know from canada what methods do you use and how do you ensure that theyre used effectively
1701520 we accept totally in europe that you cannot kill any animal without some pain we have to accept that but the important thing is how can we do it as painlessly as possible for the animal
1701521 the commission has said to the parliament and to the council we think the present situation where theres no legal clarity where you have certain bans introduced by certain member states which fragments our european market
1701522 it creates problems we dont like it so we have said we hope you can adopt this as quickly as possible
1701523 of course canada will lobby and russia will lobby and the u s humane society will lobby thats what we call democracy it could go any way
1701524 we have already said we are willing to sit down with canada in september or october to discuss the practical implementation of this
1701525 of course a lot of it is in the detail all i can say is that for the european commission weve said were very happy to sit down with canada to discuss how these measures if adopted can be implemented
1701526 again it ended up with a certification scheme conditions are quite different from seals but this is not the first time that weve had a debate with canada on the trapping of wild animals and the sale of furs weve been through all this in the past
1701527 i hope that the canadian government and indeed other governments involved appreciate the openness and the willingness of the european union not to affect traditional communities and do the best that we can to ensure a commercial seal hunt under the best possible conditions
1701528 the canadians tell me they have measures in place to prevent in their words to be humane to seals
1701529 i would have hoped they can meet these requirements and they will be able to certify that any products sold in europe meet these criteria
1701530 in fact if we dont receive an invitation we will be seeking an opportunity to engage
1701531 with leghold traps they agreed to sit down and negotiate standards
1701532 they havent agreed to that at this time yet not to my knowledge were open to reaching a particular agreement but im not so sure the european commission is open to having a negotiated agreement on this particular issue
1701533 we dont know where the bar is going to be set we dont know what their authorities are going to consider appropriate
1701534 provide updates on the status in canada and how were conducting a very sustainable humane and economically important hunt
1701535 i think its fair to say that were going to continue to meet with the european commission the european parliamentarians and member states to put ahead canadas view on this thing
1701536 i think its important for canada to get out so well just continue our interactions
1701537 we certainly would hope that these countries will exert their influence within the european commission
1701538 we certainly hope there would be people who understand hunting understand the importance of it to the livelihood of people who are removed from large european centres where millions of people are controlling an issue here
1701539 why wouldnt you want to ban the importation of any animal thats not killed humanely
1701540 why are you just singling out one because theres public pressures because theres well funded multi million dollar campaigns
1701541 this is only a tip of the iceberg next is going to be the next animal and the next one after that and theyll pick away at every single one and so if radicals are not stopped in the process it will be difficult
1701542 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1701543 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1701544 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1701545 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1701546 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1701547 i look forward to a friendly contest for the second seat with mr carrion
1701548 there is no escaping the fact that this meeting has failed
1701549 what members have let slip through their fingers this time is a package worth more than 130 billion a year in tariff savings by the end of the implementation period
1701550 theres no doubt that this is a significant setback especially for our farmers and exporters given the economic benefits they and canada stood to achieve from a positive outcome
1701551 talks may have stalled at this time but we remain committed to more liberalized trade a rules based system and the overall objectives of the doha negotiations
1701552 when you are able to close these transactions you can accomplish a lot of work through multilaterals which may take several bilaterals to accomplish
1701553 in terms of opening trade corridors for our exports we want to continue down the path of bilaterals
1701554 knocking on doors around the world to create new opportunities for our farmers and exporters
1701555 i have talked about the eu that is a negotiation that we would be very keen in launching as soon as possible
1701556 canada as an exporting and trading nation needs the wto we need an agreement on what the rules for trade are and we need more countries to reduce barriers to products we want to sell them
1701557 i think that this further collapse is very sad news
1701558 canada is a trading nation and were very trade dependant for canada to have a multilateral system that really works with rules is to our advantage
1701559 we dont have enough bargaining power to negotiate good bilaterals all over the place
1701560 its so much easier when a number of other countries can collectively lean on countries
1701561 im not against bilateral deals because if there are enough of them and enough regional deals it can create an environment that helps multilateral agreements take place
1701562 the more regional agreements you have that say mainly the same thing its only a slightly larger project to see how that will produce a greater degree of consensus globally
1701563 when one talks about multilateral trade negotiations its never over really
1701564 a lot of balls are in the air and well have to see how they all play out
1701565 in this horrible situation who can say ill even be alive in 2012
1701566 a lot of my friends neighbors people i work with in the sports world have been abducted hijacked or even killed
1701567 even when her mum used to ask her to get some stuff from the shops she would go running for it it was all built in
1701568 to be able to live and train in iraq under these circumstances
1701569 the expression of the shopkeeper offering his wares to sale
1701570 the haberdasher being the man who in an age when all men who could afford to buy anything went more or less armed purveyed those kickshaws of mans attire which were not furnished either by the silk mercer or the armourer
1701571 a board on which the dealer in small wares would display his goods
1701572 a cloth of a peculiar texture probably coarse and thick
1701573 and his etymology can be found in nearly all our dictionaries that commit themselves as to the origin of the modern english word
1701574 a kind of cloth made in very early times in england said to be of a mixed color and also to have been worn chiefly by monks
1701575 happily dixons bracing initiation is even handed enough to inspire jolts of defensive ire in readers of every stripe
1701576 a treasure trove of anecdotes quotes obscure and reassuringly familiar odd poetry and pub trivia
1701577 the initiative does not seek to privatize but rather to strengthen petroleos mexicanos
1701578 i propose to give petroleos mexicanos the financial and managerial autonomy it requires to cope with new challenges as well as possible
1701579 the oil issue in mexico is an emotional issue its an iconic issue
1701580 what you have in effect is a debate which is ongoing but a debate which doesnt base itself on fact or even the technical details of what its about but rather on the passions of political parties who want to make political hay of the issue
1701581 we have been aware of the dire situation of the mexican energy sector for many years now
1701582 so the ability of and the understating by now foreign companies and foreign governments are more than aware of their limitations more pressure doesnt help the government of mexico approve legislation
1701583 with this deal that is in congress right now we have to allow that canada and many other countries will participate in the drilling of oil exploration in our country
1701584 theres big discussion on how much pemex can partner with other companies on risk contracts theres no consensus on it

1701587 i knew wed see a snake if we came with you
1701588 disregards the diversity of views and the development of understanding which is found in the bible and does not allow for the presence of imperfect and time conditioned elements imperfecta et temporaria dei verbum 15 within scripture tually invites people to a kind of intellectual suicide
1701589 the sacred writers or to speak more accurately the holy ghost who spoke by them did not intend to teach men these things that is to say the essential nature of the things of the visible universe things in no way profitable unto salvation however with vatican ii leo tightly connects inspiration with divine inerrancy giving less attention to the autonomy of the human authors and their literary genres than has become common in the church since but it is absolutely wrong and forbidden either to narrow inspiration to certain parts only of holy scripture or to admit that the sacred writer has erred
1701590 the word of god in the life and mission of the church
1701591 and chemosh said to me go take nebo from israel
1701592 gods wisdom is somehow seeking to be communicated even through the impossibilities of the literal sense
1701593 the power of the bible is largely that it gives an unvarnished picture of human nature and of the dynamics of history and also of religion and the things that people do in its name
1701594 in practice do those engaging in genocide really seek scriptural justification in the sacred texts of hebrew religion
1701595 the texts of sacred scripture never address the question of deliberate abortion and so do not directly and specifically condemn it but they show such great respect for the human being in the mothers womb that they require as a logical consequence that gods commandment you shall not kill be extended to the unborn child as well christian tradition as the declaration on procured abortion issued by the congregation for the doctrine of the faith points out so well is clear and unanimous from the beginning up to our own day in describing abortion as a a particularly grave moral disorder from its first contacts with the greco roman world where abortion and infanticide were widely practised the first christian community by its teaching and practice radically opposed the custom rampant in that society as is clearly shown by the didache among the greek ecclesiastical writers athenagoras records that christian consider as murderesses women who have recourse to abortifacient medicines because children even if they are still in their mothers womb are already under the protection of divine providence among the latin authors tertullian affirms it is anticipated murder to prevent someone from being born it makes little difference whether one kills a soul already born or puts it to death at birth he who will one day be a man is a man already throughout christianitys two thousand year history this same doctrine has been constantly taught by the fathers of the church and by her pastors and doctors even scientific and philosophical discussions about the precise moment of the infusion of the spiritual soul have never given rise to any hesitation about the moral condemnation of abortion
1701596 the world including the faithful are looking for answers it is the responsibility of theologians to provide them
1701597 if sin clouds the intellect can we really be surprised if the perpetrators of genocide do violence to the sense of scripture as well as to their neighbor
1701598 im just not seeing a causal connection between legitimate scriptural hermeneutics and genocide here
1701599 whenever our image of god is discrepant with our view of the truth the truth takes precedence
1701600 you our captors who have taken us into bondage and have taken us far from our homes now want us to sing a psalm on your behalf
1701601 all right here goes we will never forget you o jerusalem and as for those who have destroyed her blessed are those who do the same things to them as they have to us blessed are they who bash their babies heads against a wall
1701602 though written by thy children with a smudged and crooked line thy word is ever legible its meaning unequivocal and of thy goodness even sin is valid as a sign
1701603 god did command those things whether you like it or not you are not the judge of god god is the judge of you
1701604 private interpretation was the cause of all the ills you previously mentioned in your speech the scriptures themselves condemn this telling us that our own opinions have no bearing on the truth which god has revealed
1701605 it is with no less deceit venerable brothers that other enemies of divine revelation with reckless and sacrilegious effrontery want to import the doctrine of human progress into the catholic religion
1701606 who brought forward a stoic and a platonic and a dialectical christianity
1701607 this consideration too clarifies the great error of those others as well who boldly venture to explain and interpret the words of god by their own judgement misusing their reason and holding the opinion that these words are like a human work god himself has set up a living authority to establish and teach the true and legitimate meaning of his heavenly revelation this authority judges infallibly all disputes which concern matters of faith and morals lest the faithful be swirled around by every wind of doctrine which springs from the evilness of men in encompassing error and this living infallible authority is active only in that church which was built by christ the lord upon peter the head of the entire church leader and shepherd whose faith he promised would never fail
1701608 but it is absolutely wrong and forbidden either to narrow inspiration to certain parts only of holy scripture or to admit that the sacred writer has erred
1701609 the books of the old and new testament whole and entire with all their parts as enumerated in the decree of the same council trent and in the ancient latin vulgate are to be received as sacred and canonical
1701610 since they wrote the things which he showed and uttered to them it cannot be pretended that he is not the writer for his members executed what their head dictated
1701611 most superfluous it is to inquire who wrote these things we loyally believe the holy ghost to be the author of the book
1701612 on my part i confess to your charity that it is only to those books of scripture which are now called canonical that i have learned to pay such honour and reverence as to believe most firmly that none of their writers has fallen into any error
1701613 the churchs interpretation of the sacred books is by no means to be rejected nevertheless it is subject to the more accurate judgement and correction of the exegetes divine inspiration does not extend to all of sacred scriptures so that it renders its parts each and every one free from every error if he wishes to apply himself usefully to biblical studies the exegete must first put aside all preconceived opinions about the supernatural origin of sacred scripture and interpret it the same as any other merely human document revelation could be nothing else than the consciousness man acquired of his revelation to god the church shows that she is incapable of effectively maintaining evangelical ethics since she obstinately clings to immutable doctrines which cannot be reconciled with modern progress modern catholicism can be reconciled with true science only if it is transformed into a non dogmatic christianity that is to say into a broad and liberal protestantism the following thursday the fourth day of the same month and year all these matters were accurately reported to our most holy lord pope pius x his holiness approved and confirmed the decree of the most eminent fathers and ordered that each and every one of the above listed propositions be held by all as condemned and proscribed
1701614 holding principles like these jerome was compelled when he discovered apparent discrepancies in the sacred books to use every endeavour to unravel the difficulty
1701615 that we leave to impious folk like celsus porphyry and julian
1701616 those who fancy that when it is a question of the truth of certain expressions we have not got to consider so much what god said as why he said it
1701617 it would be wholly impious to limit inspiration to certain portions only of scripture or to concede that the sacred authors themselves could have erred
1701618 precisely as things actually took place but in accordance with what men thought at that time
1701619 what i mean is this does any man believe in god the creator he cannot do so unless he first believe that the things written of gods saints are true
1701620 now unless a man believes all these and other things too which are written of the saints he cannot believe in the god of the saints
1701621 creative amnesia is not enough we need to critically overcome and dismantle what we said with such solemnity for two millennia
1701622 the eschaton is the incarnation as unfolded in history through the celebration of the eucharist
1701623 when man truly approaches the other he is uprooted from history
1701624 this is not perfect legislation the first step is what we have before us today so that we maintain important provisions in our gun registration law while we continue to look at how we can further refine our gun registration law
1701625 the handgun ban and the trigger lock requirement as applied to self defense violate the second amendment similarly the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional
1701626 i love the film whats better than a movie which has three strippers going on a killing spree in the desert

1701628 sono fiero di appartenere a uno stato in cui un premier pu essere investigato come un semplice cittadino un premier non pu essere al di sopra della legge ma nemmeno al di sotto se devo scegliere fra me la consapevolezza di essere innocente e il fatto che restando al mio posto possa mettere in grave imbarazzo il paese che amo e che ho lonore di rappresentare non ho dubbi mi faccio da parte perch anche il primo ministro devessere giudicato come gli altri dimostrer che le accuse di corruzione sono infondate da cittadino qualunque errori ne ho commessi e me ne pento per la carica che occupo ero consapevole di poter finire al centro di attacchi feroci ma nel mio caso si passata la misura

1701659 sebastian moore osb offers a persuasive and challenging moral approach to same sex relationships that should be taken as a basic reference when the church finally gets around to discussing these issues and working out a coherent approach
1701660 as pretending to be the radical categories for sexuality these categories of male and female are dualistic
1701661 belief in the vitality and the legitimacy of self governing associations as means of organizing social life and the belief that political representation must respect the principle of function recognizing associations like trade unions churches and voluntary bodies
1701662 cooperative or associative forms of socialism such as those advocated by nineteenth century writers like pierre joseph proudhon or peter kropotkin
1701663 in alliance with the decentralizing counter tendencies perceptible in the depths of economic and social development and also in alliance with most interior of all revolts slowly growing in the depth of the human soul the revolt against massed or collectivized loneliness
1701664 it is an injustice a grave evil and a disturbance of right order for a larger and higher organization to arrogate to itself functions which can be performed efficiently by smaller and lower bodies
1701665 by intervening directly and depriving society of its responsibility the social assistance state leads to a loss of human energies and an inordinate increase of public agencies which are dominated more by bureaucratic ways of thinking than concern for their clients in fact it would appear that needs are best understood and satisfied by people who are closest to them and who act as neighbors to those in need
1701666 with centralization you have apoplexy at the center and paralysis at the extremities
1701667 failed to make institutional arrangements to put these into effect leaving it to a curia which was generally opposed to the idea
1701668 new ideas germinate everywhere seeking to force their way into the light to find an application in life everywhere they are opposed by the inertia of those whose interest it is to maintain the old order they suffocate in the stifling atmosphere of prejudice and traditions
1701669 in the social realm in contrast to the political revolution has no creative force but only the force to dissolve to liberate and to lend power that is it can only bring to completion what has already taken form in the womb of pre revolutionary society
1701670 twenty one autochthonous churches inside the catholic church some of them very ancient like the first century melkites of lebanon with a longer history than the roman church they are all in communion with the pope but they have their own governance their own patriarch their own priests some married some not their own liturgies in their own languages
1701671 daring ideas are like chessmen moved forward they may be beaten but they may start a winning game
1701672 argued in favour of power being dispersed within the church among semi autonomous national churches and to smaller units like dioceses and monastic communities and was particularly insistent on stressing the role of the church as a community in history with a mission not only for its own flourishing but also for challenging and changing the world cannot be a mere
1701673 daily operation is in the hands of authorities to whom considerable independence is granted
1701674 uncertainty about what degree of accommodation the law of the land can and should give to minority communities with their own strongly entrenched legal and moral codes
1701675 the problems around roman catholic adoption agencies which emerged in relation to the sexual orientation regulations last spring
1701676 we have taken it for granted that the law protects the consciences of religious believers however there are signs that this cannot necessarily be taken quite so easily for granted as the assumptions of our society become more secular i think we ought to keep an eye on this trend and if we do we shall have to do more thinking about the models of society and law we work with
1701677 a strong doctrine of conscience is an indispensable underpinning for a solid liberalism
1701678 some concept of common good that is not prescribed solely in terms of revealed law however provisional or imperfect such a situation is thought to be and this implies in turn that the muslim even in a predominantly muslim state has something of a dual identity as citizen and as believer within the community of the faithful
1701679 our social identities are not constituted by one exclusive set of relations or mode of belonging even if one of those sets is regarded as relating to the most fundamental and non negotiable level of reality as established by a covenant between the divine and the human as in jewish and christian thinking
1701680 an assumption on the religious side that membership of the community belonging to the umma or the church or whatever is the only significant category so that participation in other kinds of socio political arrangement is a kind of betrayal
1701681 when secular government assumes a monopoly in terms of defining public and political identity
1701682 citizenship in a secular society should not necessitate the abandoning of religious discipline any more than religious discipline should deprive one of access to liberties secured by the law of the land to the common benefits of secular citizenship
1701683 it might be possible to think in terms of what she ayelet shachar calls transformative accommodation a scheme in which individuals retain the liberty to choose the jurisdiction under which they will seek to resolve certain carefully specified matters so that power holders are forced to compete for the loyalty of their shared constituents
1701684 the best argument for faith schools from the point of view of any aspiration towards social harmony and understanding is that they bring communal loyalties into direct relation with the wider society and inevitably lead to mutual questioning and sometimes mutual influence towards change without compromising the distinctiveness of the essential elements of those communal loyalties
1701685 separate schools in the province are just part of a system of domination
1701686 the state should guarantee that left wing parents can send their children to left wing schools liberals to liberal schools catholics to schools of catholic inspiration
1701687 this would be merely ridiculous if this clerical propaganda were not smuggling in as freedom a conception that divides citizens into corporations in aggressive competition with one another maniacally obsessed with expanding their own territory rather than building spaces open to the encounter with diverse cultures
1701688 citizenship as an abstract form of equal access and equal accountability
1701689 has often brought violent injustice in its wake think of the various attempts to reduce citizenship to rational equality in the france of the 1790s or the china of the 1970s
1701690 a mechanism whereby any human participant in a society is protected against the loss of certain elementary liberties of self determination
1701691 an uneasy alliance of self determining individuals arguing about the degree to which their freedom is limited by one another and needing forcible restraint in a war of all against all though that is increasingly the model which a narrowly rights based culture fosters producing a manically litigious atmosphere and a conviction of the inadequacy of customary ethical restraints and traditions of what was once called civility
1701692 a defence of an unqualified secular legal monopoly in terms of the need for a universalist doctrine of human right or dignity is to misunderstand the circumstances in which that doctrine emerged and that the essential liberating and religiously informed vision it represents is not imperilled by a loosening of the monopolistic framework
1701693 the reluctance of a dominant rights based philosophy to acknowledge the liberty of conscientious opting out from collaboration in procedures or practices that are in tension with the demands of particular religious groups the assumption in rather misleading shorthand that if a right or liberty is granted there is a corresponding duty upon every individual to activate this whenever called upon
1701694 the refusal of a religious believer to act upon the legal recognition of a right is not given the plural character of society a denial to anyone inside or outside the community of access to that right
1701695 it would be a pity if the immense advances in the recognition of human rights led because of a misconception about legal universality to a situation where a person was defined primarily as the possessor of a set of abstract liberties and the laws function was accordingly seen as nothing but the securing of those liberties irrespective of the custom and conscience of those groups which concretely compose a plural modern society
1701696 here the archbishop praises the recognition of human rights and in the next breath speaks of abstract liberties that should not be imposed in defiance of the custom and conscience of religious groups
1701697 we do not contest your right but we leave it to the state to look after it while we reject it in our own practice
1701698 we reject your right because we believe the state is mistaken in recognizing it
1701699 one of the consequences of political pluralism was an acceptance of the idea of a secular state a particular church is seen socially and politically as merely one among many religious non religious and anti religious groups in the state and as such it can claim no special privileges
1701700 so much of our thinking in the modern world dominated by european assumptions my italics about universal rights rests surely on the basis that the law is the law there is a bit of a risk here in the way we sometimes talk about the universal vision of post enlightenment politics the great protest of the enlightenment was against authority that appealed only to tradition its claim to override traditional forms of governance and custom by looking towards a universal tribunal was entirely intelligible against the background of despotism and uncritical inherited privilege my italics which prevailed in so much of early modern europe
1701701 the important springs of moral vision in a society will be in those areas which a systematic abstract universalism regards as private in religion above all
1701702 without certain themes consistently and strongly emphasised by the abrahamic faiths themes to do with the unconditional possibility for every human subject to live in conscious relation with god and in free and constructive collaboration with others there is no guarantee that a universalist account of human dignity would ever have seemed plausible or even emerged with clarity
1701703 did not base his politics on a religious foundation but upon a humanist belief in the importance of human personality
1701704 thanks to the bible and the church we know our human dignity
1701705 toleration then was not achieved by any single religious group but by the failure of any group to predominate sufficiently to crush the rest toleration was thrust upon us
1701706 crude oppositions and mythologies whether of the nature of sharia or the nature of the enlightenment
1701707 legal universalism when divorced from a serious theoretical and i would argue religious underpinning can turn into a positivism as sterile as any other variety
1701708 perhaps the blair government applied the law without serious theoretical underpinning but surely in normal advanced societies there is a deep body of reflection behind the law
1701709 a single sovereign power beyond challenge something that is not only a final court of appeal but in some sense a source of legitimacy for other groups here the law of the state is a universal and impersonal tribunal before which every individual stands on a perfectly equal neutral footing
1701710 the faith community like other self regulating communities has to be seen as a partner in the negotiations of public life otherwise the most important motivations for moral action in the public sphere will be obliged to conceal themselves and religious identity pursued and cultivated behind locked doors can be distorted by its lack of access to the air and the criticism of public debate
1701711 the lawful state is not one in which sovereign authority delegates downwards but one in which the component overlapping but distinct first level communities and associations that make up the state are assured that their interests are both recognised and effectively brokered
1701712 one of the effects of christian theology and practice is the emergence of the secular state the state that has no absolutely given claim on ultimate loyalties yet can rightly claim to be lawful to the extent that it faithfully enables the negotiation of diverse communities in a peaceful context
1701713 the christian denial of sacred givenness to any political order should make us as wary of any such universal sovereignty embodied in international law as of any sacred claims for this or that national polity there is ultimately only one sovereignty which is theologically grounded and that is christs
1701714 if either the pope or the queen demanded of me an absolute obedience he or she would be transgressing the laws of human nature and human society i give absolute obedience to neither
1701715 the nineteenth century confidence that the state had the right to require and pursue its own moral goals
1701716 survived the thirties with great resilience only to collapse after 1945 with surprising rapidity
1701717 the very idea of the coexistence of moral communities in a complex state could be seen as itself a convergent morality of sorts and one with a theological underpinning it is good for first level communities to see their account of the social good set in the context of other such accounts good for it to have to argue its case it is good because it represents the best security we have against uncriticised sacralised power in the political realm
1701718 if the state does indeed have a kind of moral interest as i have been suggesting it is twofold an interest in securing the liberty of groups to pursue their own social goods and an interest in building in to its own processes a set of cautions and defences against absolutism
1701719 despite its regular collapse back into theocratic dreams the christian tradition rests upon a strong conviction that no political order other than the body of christ can claim the authority of god and the body of christ is not a political order on the same level as others competing for control but a community that signifies that points to a possible healed human world
1701720 in spite of the massive counter movements of the twentieth century communism and the third reich the drift of modern society seems inexorably away from any commitment to the state as morally purposive reality
1701721 the church is the home of eternal truth crucified and risen
1701722 to be a catholic is to find none of this surprising
1701723 trent tackled the sacrifice of the mass and the real presence in the eucharist in two separate sessions some time apart
1701724 is it not now at very long last clear that the whole problem arose from the
1701725 what makes this matter rather piquant is that the last pope wrote the mass is essentially
1701726 but surely it is clear that the finding in the eucharistic prayer of what ratzinger brilliantly calls a transformation of existence even of death into thanksgiving is simply the discovery of what in this meal is wholly special and indeed unique it is not a de emphasizing of the fact that it
1701727 ratzinger has said that the notion of the eucharist is a meal is the fundamental mistake of the new reformers such as guardini who did much to save the soul of german catholic youth from the ravages of the third reich
1701728 once this confusion is overcome it makes perfect sense to see the mass as a ritual meal in which the participants with understanding faith hear the celebrant utter the great prayer that transforms existence even death into thanksgiving
1701729 and it is just here that there occurs to me what alexander schmemann the great orthodox theologian names as the eucharistic crisis eastern and western the loss of the assembly
1701730 now let us take a big leap to the innovative advocacy of frequent communion by pius x the full significance of which has only just dawned on me
1701731 and now another connection begins to appear between the mass not evidently a ritual meal and the mass clericalised
1701732 this leads me to invoke in conclusion a ground breaking book on the mass that appeared in 1993
1701733 do this in memory of me lukes gospel agrees with pauls account in first corinthians in having jesus give that command to those who were eating with him at the last supper
1701734 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1701735 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1701736 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1701737 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1701738 i really need to take a short drive to a burger place
1701739 i just might make the short drive to class today
1701740 i was only on a short drive it must be mom who used up all the gas
1701741 why did we even decide to go on this long drive
1701742 this is nothing like the long drives we took in my day son
1701743 you should hear about the lovely long drive we took last summer
1701744 dont ask me when were going to be there ask the driver
1701745 im the coach of every winning team but still a loser in my mind

1701748 our customers have noticed that weve continued down this path of using our own proprietary company centric methodologies because they have to support n number of ways of doing things on n n number of tools which is making their job of porting verification information a challenge
1701749 what we have been doing is hampering design collaboration because as one team finishes what they are doing finishes a block or project theyve been working on they then need to integrate that into their overall design each group may be using a different vendors tool and using different methods and it may be that multiple companies are collaborating on a design but today they cant easily port verification ip back and forth
1701750 users would essentially have to do the work themselves and build a bridge between the two vendors environments to make the vip work in the others tool environment
1701751 the new ovm will eliminate the need for users to create that bridge on their own what we are doing is enabling a truly interoperable verification ip environment promoting language interoperability and enabling data portability across multiple simulator platforms to deliver on the promise of systemverilog and open up a very healthy and vibrant design and verification community
1701752 there are a lot of methodological implications that then connect into even higher level library functions and then even into the way tools need to interpret data and then the way customers need to take ip from different sources and configure it for different parameters and then start operating it controlling it and being able to get messages back
1701753 there are a lot of considerations for plug and play ip from multiple sources as well as the path from block to chip to system level reuse which tends to bring in other languages such as systemc
1701754 we think ovm will be a great step toward speeding up the adoption of systemverilog and advanced verification methodologies
1701755 we think it will be very well received by the user community and move to 100 adoption very quickly
1701756 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1701757 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1701758 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1701759 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1701760 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1701761 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1701762 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1701763 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1701764 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1701765 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1701766 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1701767 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1701768 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1701769 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

1701779 quite frankly theres enough water left to last for months weve got a serious drought theres no doubt about it anytime you deplete your entire storage pool and tap into the reserve
1701780 los angeles added 1 million people without increasing their water supply
1701781 and if los angeles can do it ill tell you georgia can
1701782 you can see that if we can just manage the rainfall and utilize that and make sure that we have abundant storage for it we can take care of our needs well into the future
1701783 you cant wear out water its clearly an opportunity that needs to be explored
1701784 hey its been a lot of fun but i think were just meant to be friends
1701785 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1701786 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
1701787 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1701788 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1701789 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1701790 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1701791 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1701792 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1701793 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1701794 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1701795 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1701796 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1701797 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1701798 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1701799 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1701800 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1701801 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1701802 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1701803 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1701804 wat komen die twee voeters hier eigenlijk doen in onze tuin

1701806 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1701807 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1701808 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1701809 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1701810 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1701811 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1701812 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1701813 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1701814 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1701815 many of us bishops acceding to that pastoral judgment of pope john paul have granted permission for masses even on a regular basis following the tridentine usage
1701816 just at the moment when the situation was beginning to settle down and the deeper and more spiritual aspects of the renewal were becoming possible a whole new battle began one in which the renewal itself was brought into question or where everyone seemed free to project his or her personal views on how the renewal of the council should have taken place
1701817 moreover since the conferences of bishops around the world were involved in the post vatican ii liturgical implementation they are now under suspicion their wisdom and authority are placed under a cloud of mistrust
1701818 seen from this vantage point in the trenches the decision that caused confusion and harm in the church was not that made by pope paul vi to permit only one latin rite but the decision to permit the tridentine usage to enjoy equal footing with the reformed rite
1701819 if the tridentine is so manifestly bad why on earth are old liberals so afraid of it
1701820 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1701821 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1701822 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1701823 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1701824 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1701825 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1701826 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1701827 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1701828 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1701829 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1701830 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1701831 of het opzet was ik weet het tot op de dag van vandaag nog steeds niet maar daar stond greet op vakantie bij haar ouders baterrij opladen en zoals ze zeggen van het een misverstand kwam het ander of het klikte en hoe trouwens de vonken springen er nog steeds af en marc die sanderendaags al zei
1701832 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1701833 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

1701863 hybrids are top of mind for buyers seeking low emissions high fuel efficiency vehicles but not all hybrids are created equal
1701864 when developing the altima hybrid nissan engineers had a requirement to make it a nissan style hybrid not just a fuel efficient car this is a key reason that the altima hybrid has done so well when stacked up against the competition such as in the recent comparison by a leading automotive enthusiast magazine which called the altima hybrid the best among the hybrids tested
1701865 altima hybrids drive system creates a synergy between its electric motor and its gasoline engine offering efficiency and excitement in the same attractive package
1701866 altima hybrid feels remarkably smooth most drivers will never be aware of the transitions between the electric and gasoline power sources
1701867 mostly what they will feel is highly responsive acceleration and the seamless delivery of power under almost all driving conditions

1701872 iran is defying the will of the international community by continuing uranium enrichment
1701873 collectors of these items are now being looked upon as thieves which may not be a bad thing because there is something essentially barbarous in the removal of objects from people who look upon them as being sacred if not their soul
1701874 theft by them was one thing but the destruction of things of beauty like the porcelain pagoda in nanking and the burning down of the summer palace in peking under lord elgins personal direction must be regarded as the high water mark of savagery
1701875 the british house of lords sometime ago echoed with peals of laughter or should i say hoots of delight or was it savage glee when the question of returning the regalia of the ashanti in ghana was raised
1701876 perhaps the consequences of such a law were to be feared because as lady lee pointed out when it comes to returning booty from this country we should tread warily because it may turn into a strip tease at which point the report goes the lords guffawed heartily for lord goronway roberts it must be said that he put on a brave stand as brave as the british soldiers who were killed by the king of ashanti in horrible conditions in that part of the world and on whose behalf the ashanti regalia was taken as part of an indemnity agreed to by the defeated king so that the dependants of those killed could be compensated lord goronway roberts was not actually putting his handkerchief to his streaming eyes when he said that he sympathised with the motivation of the question that had been raised but if it was to promote good commonwealth relations returning the regalia was not the best way to do it it was at this point that the laughter rose once more when someone asked whether it was possible to keep the booty in britain and return the soul of the ashanti people which reposed in the footstool of the regalia to ghana
1701877 are only too ready to argue that all people in all ages have committed acts of violence violence yes but not necessarily acts of baseness perpetrated what is more in the name of liberty equality fraternity civilisation progress and the rights of man the conscious calculated methodical official and by no means anonymous destruction of the red race its traditions and culture in north america and partly also in south america far from having been an unavoidable process and as such possibly excusable in the name of natural laws provided one does not oneself claim to have outgrown these laws thanks to civilisation this destruction it must be said certainly remains one of the greatest crimes and most noted vandalisms of all human history
1701878 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1701879 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1701880 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1701881 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1701882 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1701883 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1701884 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1701885 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1701886 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1701887 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1701888 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

1701902 grubbing around on its hands and knees in quite a commonplace world

1701936 ada beberapa pasal di statuta khususnya pasal 56 yang mencerminkan sikap kesewenang wenangan seorang rektor karena dia bisa dengan mudah mengangkat dan memberhentikan para pembantunya

1701944 in our lives we lost so much during the depression we started with nothing and we ended up with nothing but it was a long life a good life with lots of ups and downs

1701946 mum never forgot a birthday and christmas was always special for everyone
1701947 the formulation of revealed truth develops through the discernment of new truths that are formally implicit in the apostolic deposit such truths once proclaimed by the church as divinely revealed are dogmas and must be held by all as matters of divine and catholic faith social teaching on the other hand consists of behavioral norms for social conduct in conformity with the gospel while the principles remain constant the proximate norms are not free from contingency because society itself is in flux specific regulations rarely have the universal and permanent character that belongs to dogma
1701948 the overarching thesis seems to be that in all these areas social change makes it possible for christians to overcome the blindness that had previously afflicted their moral vision the doctrinal change in noonans estimation is in many cases an about face repudiating the erroneous past teaching of the magisterium itself
1701949 the popes themselves held slaves including at times hundreds of muslim captives to man their galleys although the subjection of one person to another servitus was not part of the primary intention of the natural law st thomas taught it was appropriate and socially useful in a world impaired by original sin
1701950 thus it was no break with previous teaching when gregory xvi in 1839 issued a general condemnation of the enslavement of indians and blacks in particular he condemned the importation of negro slaves from africa
1701951 at the time of the civil war very few catholics in the united states felt that papal teaching required them to become abolitionists bishop john england stood with the tradition in holding that there could be just titles to slavery
1701952 in 1863 john henry newman penned some fascinating reflections on slavery a fellow catholic william t allies asked him to comment on a lecture he was planning to give asserting that slavery was intrinsically evil newman replied that although he would like to see slavery eliminated he could not go so far as to condemn it as intrinsically evil for if it were st paul would have had to order philemon liberate all your slaves at once newman as i see it stood with the whole catholic tradition in 1866 the holy office in response to an inquiry from africa ruled that although slavery servitus was undesirable it was not per se opposed to natural or divine law this ruling pertained to the kind of servitude that was customary in certain parts of africa at the time
1701953 homicide genocide abortion euthanasia and voluntary suicide mutilation physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit whatever is offensive to human dignity such as sub human living conditions arbitrary imprisonments deportation slavery prostitution and trafficking in women and children degrading conditions of work which treat laborers as mere instruments of profit and not as free responsible persons
1701954 it seems to me that if he had wanted to assert his position as definitive he would have had to say more clearly how he was defining slavery he would have had to make it clear that he was rejecting the nuanced views of the biblical writers and catholic theologians for so many past centuries if any form of slavery could be justified under any conditions slavery as such would not be in the technical sense intrinsically evil
1701955 according to the logic of noonans argument whatever holds for slavery would have to be said for deportations subhuman living conditions and degrading conditions of work but could not degrading or subhuman conditions be inevitable for example after some great natural disaster in which mere survival is an achievement
1701956 so far as i am aware he never repeated his assertion that slavery is intrinsically evil neither the catechism of the catholic church nor the recent compendium of the social doctrine of the church in their discussions of slavery speaks so absolutely
1701957 certain attenuated forms of servitude such as serfdom are not opposed to natural law except in its secondary requirements or aspirations
1701958 cannot be eliminated except by degrees as machinery and technology develop servile labor becomes less necessary
1701959 with more sophisticated forms of economic and social organization it becomes possible and indeed imperative to diminish servitude and to abolish slavery in the usual sense of the word in the new heavens of the resurrection every form of servitude will disappear
1701960 radical forms of slavery that deprive human beings of all personal rights are never morally permissible but more or less moderate forms of subjection and servitude will always accompany the human condition
1701961 the elimination of slavery possible in our time corresponds to a natural dynamism of the human spirit toward freedom and personal responsibility
1701962 the goal of full and uninhibited freedom however is an eschatological ideal never fully attainable within history
1701963 one can search in vain through the interventions of the holy see those of pius v urban viii and benedict xiv for any condemnation of the actual principle of slavery
1701964 the magisterium condemned from the beginning the colonial slavery that developed in the newly discovered lands
1701965 from 1435 to 1890 we have numerous bulls and encyclicals from several popes written to many bishops and the whole christian faithful condemning both slavery and the slave trade
1701966 there were to be found subsequently among the faithful some who shamefully blinded by the desire of sordid gain in lonely and distant countries did not hesitate to reduce to slavery in servitutem redigere indians blacks and other unfortunate peoples or else by instituting or expanding the trade in those who had been made slaves by others aided the crime of others the slave trade although it has been somewhat diminished is still carried on by numerous christians therefore desiring to remove such a great shame from all christian peoples and walking in the footsteps of our predecessors we by apostolic authority warn and strongly exhort in the lord faithful christians of every condition that no one in the future dare to bother unjustly despoil of their possessions or reduce to slavery in servitutem redigere indians blacks or other such peoples
1701967 the buying and selling of slaves unjustly held was also condemned by 1435
1701968 thus if this document condemned our domestic slavery as an unlawful and consequently immoral practice the bishops could not have accepted it without being bound to refuse the sacraments to all who were slave holders unless they manumitted their slaves yet if you look to the prelates who accepted the document for the acceptation was immediate and unanimous you will find 1st the archbishop of baltimore 2d the bishop of bardstown 3d the bishop of charleston 4th the bishop of st louis 5th the bishop of mobile 6th the bishop of new orleans and 7th the bishop of nashville they all regarded the letter as treating of the slave trade and not as touching domestic slavery i believe sir we may consider this to be pretty conclusive evidence as to the light in which that document is viewed by the roman catholic church
1701969 amazingly it was decided that papal pronouncements against slavery particularly gregory xvis in supremo did not apply to the institution as it existed in the united states thus yielding on this issue a sort of americanized gallicanism
1701970 it is hard to understand how the american hierarchy was not aware of the consistency of the teaching and its nature
1701971 recently in first things magazine i read an article by avery dulles sj in which he argued that while the church does not like slavery neither does she see it as being intrinsically evil and opposed to the natural law he concluded that the church still holds this position as doctrine and pointed out that no vatican documents thus far have refuted it i absolutely love the writings of cardinal dulles but what am i to think of this as a black catholic it practically validates the claims which black protestants continuously make against the church reading that article has left me utterly confused in my catholic faith how can slavery not be contrary to the natural law i always thought prior catholic support for slavery was distinct from authoritative church teaching as was the case with limbo is cardinal dulles wrong here
1701972 it is not contrary to the natural and divine law for a slave to be sold bought exchanged or given
1701973 the magisterium condemned unjust enslavement early on but it also recognized what is known as
1701974 but chattel slavery as practiced in the united states and elsewhere differed in kind not merely degree from just title slavery for it made a claim on the slave as property and enslaved people who were not criminals or prisoners of war by focusing on just title servitude critics unfairly neglect the vigorous papal denunciations of chattel slavery
1701975 the matter is further muddled by certain nineteenth century american clergy including some bishops and theologians who tried to defend the american slave system they contended that the long standing papal condemnations of slavery didnt apply to the united states the slave trade some argued had been condemned by pope gregory xvi but not slavery itself
1701976 it was certain members of the american hierarchy of the time who
1701977 we can look to the practice of non compliance with the teachings of the papal magisterium as a key reason why slavery was not directly opposed by the church in the united states
1701978 the 1866 instructions claim that trade in justly acquired slaves is not opposed to the divine and natural comes as an inference licensed in part by the more general claim that
1701979 i know of no recent magisterial statement to the effect that trade in justly acquired slaves is
1701980 we cannot deduce from what he did say about slavery that all forms of involuntary servitude are intrinsically evil
1701981 and thats all thats needed to show that the development which took place in jp2s teaching is compatible with what the church had previously taught with her full authority
1701982 holy church as his creation and her teachings as his own
1701983 the church in the past consistently condemned chattel slavery whether or not popes always respected that condemnation in practice
1701984 so i believe such trade should be banned as part of a policy of reducing such injustices not because i believe it to intrinsically evil
1701985 it is not intrinsically evil to acquire a slave from the state as a punishment for the enslaved and it can be just to get compensation for releasing that slave from service
1701986 i think i gained a couple pounds cause that was soooooo saulty
1701987 it is disingenuous the way relationships are glamorized on film with the proverbial ride off into the sunset conclusion

1701997 is an exceedingly important patient for christendom but he is not the physician
1701998 the ecclesiastical formulae concerning the person of christ need to be subjected to continual criticism the ecclesiastical formulae are on the one hand products of controversy in that although the original consciousness was the same in all yet the thought expressive of it took different forms
1701999 dogmatic was overloaded with a multitude of definitions which have absolutely no other relation to the immediate christian self consciousness than that indicated by the history of controversy
1702000 dogma in its conception and development is a product of the greek mind on the soil of the gospel
1702001 the demand for a complete reappraisal of the churchs belief in christ right up to the present day is an urgent one
1702002 like the monotheism of islam its later caricature it is simply the supreme example the culmination and completion of the disobedience which from the beginning constituted the human side of the dealings of the one and only god with his chosen people

1702007 i am not ignorant of what certain ignorant and timorous ones proclaim that one ought to concern oneself with the most needful things those that contain the faith and pass over the outer superfluous things that wear us out in vain and occupy us with what contributes nothing to the goal
1702008 the unified way in which language and literature ancient philosophy and christian teaching were transmitted in the byzantine tradition

1702010 the two attitudes authoritys responsibility to protect society against error and a general confidence that the mind should be free to explore the books of christian pagan and infidel in search of truth coexisted with remarkably few conflicts until the reformation
1702011 there is no department of knowledge scientia that gives us more certainty of christs divinity than magic and cabala
1702012 the profound significance of pico della mirandola in the history of humanity can hardly be overestimated he it was who first boldly formulated a new position for european man man as magus using both magia and cabala to act upon the world to control his destiny by science
1702013 the intermediary between creatures that he is the familiar of the gods above him as he is the lord of the beings beneath him that by the acuteness of his senses the inquiry of his reason and the light of his intelligence he is the interpreter of nature set midway between the timeless unchanging and the flux of time
1702014 removed man from the centre of the neoplatonic hierarchy of being and allotted him instead an indeterminate ontological status
1702015 longed for some creature which might comprehend the meaning of so vast an achievement which might be moved with love at its beauty and smitten with awe at its grandeur
1702016 should have a share in the particular endowment of every other creature
1702017 the nature of all other creatures is defined and restricted within laws which we have laid down you by contrast impeded by no such restrictions may by your own free will to whose custody we have assigned you trace for yourself the lineaments of your own nature
1702018 you may as the free and proud shaper of your own being fashion yourself in the form you may prefer it will be in your power to descend to the lower brutish forms of life you will be able through your own decision to rise again to the superior orders whose life is divine
1702019 so young so learned so sure of his powers no wonder pico represented even for burckhardt the lofty flight which italian philosophy would have taken had not the counter reformation annihilated the higher spiritual life of the people burckhardt knew that picos conception of human freedom in the cosmos empowered man to have what he chooses to be what he wants but he seems not to have realised that one dimension of this freedom was magical licit magic makes man prince and master of creation even of the wicked spirits who tempt him to forbidden demonic magic

1702021 marlowes blasphemies and iconoclasm are in fact typical of his time just before marlowe went up to corpus christi college gabriel hervey noted that in cambridge you cannot step into a scholars study but ten to one you shall lightly find open either bodin

1702023 the natural man epitomized a basic contradiction in reformed christianity divine justice exists in order to terrorize him into good behavior yet he has ample inducement not to believe in the very law that transforms him into a god fearing citizen
1702024 for marlowe as later for the ben jonson of sejanus and catiline the hero who every so often appears in the world is nothing but the hypostasis of a malefic force and can bring only destruction and death
1702025 tamberlaine is conscious of pursuing in parallel with the material struggle a metaphysical struggle marlowe seems to follow the titanism of his character with a jumpy and nervous affection
1702026 as if the poet had convinced himself that the true essence of man can be better gleaned in the suffering of the soul than in that of the body or as if of a sudden his heart was penetrated by a feeble ray of goodness that would surely have borne fruit if he had had the time

1702030 campaigns in ireland had been marked with a swift and relentless cruelty amounting to barbarism stories of his wholesale massacres of prisoners had lent terror to his name
1702031 david woods september 21st refers to muslim massacres of those who refused to surrender in a siege but this practice normal in ancient rome was also followed by christians such as sir walter raleigh in one incident in ireland
1702032 in 1580 troops sent by pope gregory and commanded by sebastiano di san giuseppe landed at smerwick in kerry after a three day siege san giuseppe surrendered on october 10th 1580 to arthur grey the lord lieutenant of ireland then called the lord deputy grey ordered a massacre italian spanish and irish men and irish women were beheaded and their bodies thrown into the sea according to folklore the english spent two days decapitating their victims see the monument at d n an ir oleary is not correct if he suggests that grey and walter raleigh a participant acted according to the normal practice of the time even by the standards of their own day these men were war criminals
1702033 it was known that raleigh opposed lord greys iron fisted tactics in dealing with the irish and there was bad blood between the two grey refused to have raleigh present in his army raleigh as recorded by the state papers 1574 85 was left behind in the armys main camp in rathkeale co limerick while lord ormond black tom butler and sir william stanley left to join lord grey at smerwick the italians and spanish were massacred in fort d nan ir by men led by edward denny ward of the day together with sailors from the english naval ships lying off shore under admiral william winter during the 16th century world the usual end to the taking of a town or castle was a complete massacre of the inhabitants there were no women massacred at smerwick as there were none present perhaps this was because of the distance and the grilling speed at which grey drove his men from dingle and possibly the presence of six naval ships with tenders moored in the vicinity a detailed account of this massacre together with a vindication of sir walter raleigh was given in a recent publication of the kerry archaeological and historical journal series 2 vol 4 2004
1702034 the official report from smerwick sent to secretary of state walsyngham on november 11th 1580 states that the morrowe after the ffortes were yeelded all the irish men and women hanged this report from the state papers is printed in sir john pope hennessys sir walter ralegh in ireland london 1883 p 207 cf calendar of state papers ireland1574 85 vol lxxviii no 27
1702035 had now in his companie about eight hundred men under the leadings of capteine zouch capteine walter raleigh capteine denie capteine macworth capteine achin and others and then he marched towardd the fort d n an ir smerwick where the spaniards and romans were setled capteine raleigh notwithstanding that the lord deputie had raised his campe at rekell rathkeale co limerick and was gone towards the fort yet he taried and staied behind minding to practise some exploit
1702036 this first daie of batterie was capteine raleighs ward daie the fourth daie was capteine zouches ward daie when the spanish capteine had yeelded himselfe and the fort appointed to be surrendered capteine raleigh together with capteine macworth entered into the castell and made a great slaughter manie or the most part of them being put to the sword
1702037 as they watched the creation of this type of asiatic absolutism marlowes audience were being offered an ironic analysis of the culture they themselves inhabited war it turns out belongs not in the realm of theodicy as a writer like spenser would have us believe but in the realm of strategy piracy cynically legitimized by cecil and the monarchy was for elizabethans in reality the most notable form of war
1702038 he adopts a position of sardonic detachment bordering on contempt from his creations a stance which is like the position of a jester vis vis his subjects the subject centred approach to marlowe which interprets his protagonists as projections of his own fantasy and passions is particularly alluring since his dramaturgy through respectable does not set in motion a host of three dimensional human characters as shakespeares does the creator does not disappear behind his handiwork his subjectivity is felt at every turn
1702039 his depiction of the frolicsome suggests marlowes delight jouissance in the ludic the way he and his characters are as we have seen clowns who follow their desires and explore and subvert lite groups within their societies indeed marlowes whole aesthetic is frolicsome like oscar wildes at once indecorous sensuous outrageous and serious
1702040 enough in marlowe to question the current orthodox opinion that in the early modern period or at least in literary texts there was homosexual activity without the emergence of homosexual identity
1702041 magic has two forms one consists wholly in the operations and powers of demons and consequently this appears to me as god is my witness an execrable and monstrous thing the other proves when thoroughly investigated to be nothing else but the highest realization of natural philosophy
1702042 maintains this magic while so abhorring that other that once when he was invited to take part in rites of evil spirits he said that they ought rather to come to him than he to go to them and he spoke well just as that first form of magic makes man a slave and pawn of evil powers the latter makes him their lord and master that first form of magic cannot justify any claim to being either an art or a science while the latter filled as it is with mysteries embraces the most profound contemplation of the deepest secrets of things and finally the knowledge of the whole of nature this beneficent magic in calling forth as it were from their hiding places into the light the powers which the largess of god has sown and planted in the world does not itself work miracles so much as sedulously serve nature as she works her wonders
1702043 whereas marlowes play is a tragedy of learning goethes faust is much broader and could well be called a tragedy of being
1702044 the gnoseological titanism is a gratuitous addition of modern critics to the list of his sins
1702045 fausts deserts learnings golden gifts for a different food that of magic
1702046 to discover its true self the mind must withdraw from the otherness which is involved in sense perception and rational knowledge and turn inward
1702047 several senecan passages describe the souls power to range through heaven
1702048 the view that heaven and hell are states of mind was held by amaury of bene a medieval heretic often cited in seventeenth century accounts of atheism it is to be distinguished from the ubiquism of marlowes mephistophilis in william blake acutely observed that
1702049 dass ich erkenne was die welt im innersten zusammenh lt
1702050 erkennest denn der sterne lauf und wenn natur dich unterweist dann geht die seelenkraft dir auf wie spricht ein geist zum andern geist

1702054 in faust himself an ever higher and purer activity up to the end and from above the eternal love coming to his assistance this stands in complete harmony with our religious ideas according to which we attain beatitude not merely through our own power but though the divine grace that is added to it
1702055 i gave him goethe an account of lamenais sic and his ultramontanism no doubt said he but all truth comes from god but when these people say that it is through the church god announces truth they are not aware that god speaks by and through everything every insect every leaf has something to say

1702092 it blows my mind really to see how much kids get away with
1702093 ive seen kids cut up pills like ritalin and anti depressants in the bathroom mix it with their water and take them
1702094 i know a lot of kids drinking vodka in water bottles sipping throughout the day and even offering it to friends while not being quiet about it at all teachers are slack in dealing with this issue they dont seem to want to get involved with something this serious and parents are not fearful enough
1702095 i feel like the security is not being strong enough theyre not doing their best but theyre doing okay for now i guess
1702096 i do remember smelling marijuana in the bathroom and wondering why teachers didnt do anything about it
1702097 unless we have reasonable suspicion we cannot search students for alcohol as they enter the school
1702098 if a students behavior creates reasonable suspicion our principals address the behavior with the student which may include administering an alco strip test and a search of a students backpack and locker if this is done the parents are notified of the action and the behavior that led to this action
1702099 the safe statistics on this issue are alarming and as a school board member im not going to turn my head away from this subject
1702100 one of the objectives of our new strategic plan is to enhance student and staff demonstration of core values and good citizenship in partnership with parents and our community we seek to emphasize the importance of accountable and responsible decision making we realize that our students must be healthy and of sound mind to succeed with their studies
1702101 we have to get more parents involved in their high schoolers lives period
1702102 and we need a youth commission to bring all of the local entities together to tackle some of the social issues related to our children
1702103 this fall safe is launching our caf conversations initiative which is a proven model for fostering dialogue between multigenerational groups adults and kids on important issues like this one we talk a lot about achievement but we do not talk enough about character as a value if we are to discover our values as a community we have to talk

1702106 you know im not that little where i come from
1702107 and unless you tell me how to cross this great water i shall force you to forfeit your life monster
1702108 well then i will tell you how to cross this water if you will first tell me why you are so intent on crossing it
1702109 i journey to release my countrywomen from the clutches of an evil sorceress and to find my one true queen
1702110 i will gladly take you across this water youll need all the help you can get climb onto my back you and your gentle steed you have nothing to fear from me
1702111 i leave you with one piece of wisdom little prince nothing is as it seems for all your power your greatest weapon is knowing when to surrender
1702112 there is competition for places which drives you on but until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on
1702113 ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds or when your time is up at united
1702114 the manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games and then it is time to go
1702115 hes relaxed and asks the people at barcelona to understand his situation the club is relaxed and i was figuring to put messi in the starting 11
1702116 theoretically the clubs could ask their players to go back to europe because they would be entitled to do so
1702117 and if the players do not come back there could be a case of a breach of contract
1702118 it is now the moment for everyone to sit at the table and find a reasonable solution
1702119 of course this could affect the tournament and its in the interest of nobody to destroy what could be an extraordinary tournament this year but this is a matter for clubs fifa and the players to decide
1702120 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete in olympic games of beijing 2008
1702121 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1702122 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games
1702123 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1702124 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1702125 cas calls upon the goodwill and good sense of fifa and the clubs to find a reasonable solution with regard to players who wish to represent their country in the olympic games
1702126 i dont understand why the decision comes one day before the match
1702127 we have known for several years there would be olympic games in china
1702128 the athletes are here and dreaming of the olympic games
1702129 we would love to see the clarification so the young players of the world can participate in the tournament to let the best athletes come to the games in future
1702130 to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift
1702131 experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first the lesson afterwards

1702136 each success only buys an admission ticket to a more difficult problem
1702137 the greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do
1702138 go confidently in the direction of your dreams live the life you have imagined
1702139 nothing is impossible some things are just less likely than others
1702140 you cant turn back the clock but you can wind it up again
1702141 it is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it
1702142 dont be too timid and squeamish about your actions all life is an experiment the more experiments you make the better
1702143 he who asks is a fool for five minutes but he who does not ask remains a fool forever
1702144 nobody will believe in you unless you believe in yourself
1702145 to acquire knowledge one must study but to acquire wisdom one must observe
1702146 the greatest mistake you can make in life is to be continually fearing you will make one
1702147 good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment
1702148 in prosperity our friends know us in adversity we know our friends
1702149 life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away
1702150 be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont mind
1702151 this is my wish for you comfort on difficult days smiles when sadness intrudes rainbows to follow the clouds laughter to kiss your lips sunsets to warm your heart hugs when spirits sag beauty for your eyes to see friendships to brighten your being faith so that you can believe confidence for when you doubt courage to know yourself patience to accept the truth love to complete your life
1702152 live life so completely that when death comes to you like a thief in the night there will be nothing left for him to steal
1702153 as darwin noted group selection played a strong rule in human evolution if something like helping benefits the group it will be associated with pleasure and happiness
1702154 when youre experiencing compassion benevolence and kindness they push aside the negative emotions
1702155 one of the best ways to overcome stress is to do something to help someone else
1702156 numerous studies have found that happy people are more helpful
1702157 those whove just found money in a phone booth are more likely to help a passerby with dropped papers those who feel successful are more likely to volunteer as a tutor
1702158 if the warm glow and helpers high that people experience when they help others is selfish then we need more of this kind of selfishness
1702159 sometimes we can act ourselves into a way of thinking
1702160 so like the old song says put on a happy face talk as if you have self esteem and are outgoing and optimistic going through the motions can awaken the emotions
1702161 uh folks were going to make a quick stop for refueling
1702162 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly
1702163 we have not brought in the kind of top quality player everyone seems to be expecting
1702164 we are still researching and looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate

1702176 kami tidak memaksudkan ahlul hadits hanya orang orang yang mendengar atau menulis dan meriwayatkan hadits akan tetapi yang kami maksud adalah setiap orang yang menghafal mengetahui memahami dan mengikutinya secara lahir dan batin

1702182 senantiasa ada sekelompok dari ummatku yang tegak dengan perintah allah tidak membahayakan mereka orang orang yang menghinakan dan menyelisihi mereka sampai datangnya keputusan allah hari kiamat sedangkan mereka selalu nampak dihadapan manusia
1702183 kalau mereka bukan ahlul hadits maka aku tidak mengetahui siapakah mereka
1702184 allah telah menjadikan ahlul hadits sebagai pondasi syariat dan melenyapkan dengan mereka setiap bidah yang sesat mereka adalah kepercayaan allah dari makhluk nya dan perantara antara nabi n dan umatnya serta orang orang yang bersungguh sungguh dalam menjaga ajarannya cahaya mereka berkilauan keutamaan keutamaan mereka cemerlang tanda tanda mereka bersinar terang madzhab mereka nampak hujjah hujjah mereka sangat kuat seluruh golongan mengedepankan hawa nafsu atau menganggap baik sebuah pendapat dalam mengembalikan suatu permasalahan kecuali ahlul hadits kitabullah senjata mereka sunnah rasulullah hujjah mereka rasul n golongan mereka kepadanya mereka menisbatkan diri mereka tidak condong kepada hawa nafsu dan tidak berpaling dengan pendapat hadits hadits yang mereka riwayatkan dari rasul diterima karena mereka adalah orang orang kepercayaan dan orang orang yang adil mereka penjaga dan pembela agama mereka orang orang yang memperhatikan ilmu dan pembawanya apabila ada hadits yang diperselisihkan kepada merekalah tempat kembali kalau mereka menghukumi maka keputusan mereka didengar dan diterima dari mereka semua muncul ulama dan fuqoha para imam yang mulia dan terhormat orang yang zuhud dari setiap upah dan mereka memiliki keutamaan yang mulia serta pembaca yang mahir dan khotib yang fasih mereka adalah golongan yang mulia dan jalan mereka adalah jalan yang lurus seluruh ahlu bidah memerangi aqidah mereka namun terhadap madzhab selain madzhab ahlul hadits tidak memusuhinya maka siapa yang memusuhi mereka yaitu ahlul hadits niscaya allah akan menghancurkannya dan siapa yang menentang mereka niscaya allah akan membinasakannya tidak membahayakan mereka orang orang yang menghinakannya dan tidak akan beruntung orang yang meninggalkannya orang orang yang berhati hati terhadap agamanya sangat membutuhkan nasehat mereka dan orang orang yang memandang mereka dengan kebencian pasti akan menyesal sesungguhnya allah benar benar maha kuasa menolong mereka
1702185 madzhab ahlul hadits mereka adalah salaf orang orang yang terdahulu dari tiga generasi pertama dan siapa yang meniti jalan mereka
1702186 manusia yang lebih berhak menjadi golongan yang selamat adalah ahlul hadits dan sunnah mereka tidak memiliki panutan yang diikuti kecuali rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mereka manusia yang paling mengetahui perkataannya dan perbuatan nabi n mereka manusia yang paling membedakan antara hadits yang shohih dan yang lemah para imam hadits adalah ulama yang faqih mereka adalah manusia yang paling memahami makna hadits dan mengikutinya dengan keyakinan perbuatan kecintaan dan loyalitas kepada siapa yang loyalitas terhadap sunnah mereka memusuhi siapa yang memusuhi sunnah yaitu orang orang yang menolak nash nash yang bersifat global yang datang dari dan sunnah mereka bukanlah orang yang mengambil perkataan lalu menjadikannya sebagai dasar agama dan keyakinan mereka walaupun tidak sesuai dengan ajaran yang dibawa oleh rasul akan tetapi mereka adalah orang orang yang menjadikan seluruh apa yang dibawa rasul n dari dan sunnah sebagai dasar yang mereka yakini dan jadikan sandaran
1702187 ahlul hadits adalah sebaik baik manusia yang berkata tentang ilmu
1702188 manusia yang paling teguh diatas jalan yang lurus adalah ahlul hadits
1702189 manusia yang paling luas ilmunya ilmu syari dan paling dekat dengan rasul paling mengetahui perkataannya dan perbuatannya gerak geriknya dan diamnya masuk dan keluarnya dari rumah lahir dan batinnya paling mengenal sahabatnya sejarahnya dan hari harinya paling besar perannya dalam mengumpulkan hadits dan meriwayatkannya paling teguh dalam mentaatinya dan mengikutinya dan menjadikannya sebagai suri tauladan mereka adalah ahlu sunnah dan hadits mereka menghafal sunnahnya dan mengetahui antara hadits yang shohih dan yang lemah dengan ilmu dan pemahaman yang allah berikan kepada mereka dalam memahami maknanya dengan keimanan pembenaran ketaatan dan ketundukan meraka mengikutinya dan mengambilnya sebagai suri tauladan mereka juga memiliki akal yang sangat kuat memahami qiyas mampu membedakan antara hadits shohih dan lemah maka tidakkah orang orang yang rendah agama dan akalnya mengetahui bahwasanya mereka adalah manusia yang berhak disifati dengan kejujuran ilmu dan iman yang berhak meneliti siapa yang menyelisihi mereka mereka mempunyai ilmu yang tidak diakui oleh orang orang jahil dan ahli bidah padahal apa yang ada di sisi mereka adalah kebenaran yang nyata adapun orang orang yang jahil tentang urusan petunjuk mereka dan orang orang yang menyelisihi mereka adalah orang orang yang hina dan penuh dengan kesesatan
1702190 adapun ahlul hadits mereka mencari kebenaran dari tempatnya dan mengambilnya dari sumbernya mereka mendekatkan diri beribadah kepada allah dengan mengikuti sunnah sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan mengumpulkan atsar atsarnya jejaknya dan kabar kabarnya hadits haditsnya dari timur dan barat kemudian mereka senantiasa mencari kabar kabar dan menelitinya sampai mereka mengetahui mana yang shohih dan yang lemah yang nasikh menghapus dan mansukh yang dihapus mereka juga mengetahui siapa yang menyelisihi dari sebagian ulama yang condong kepada pendapat maka merekapun memperingatkan akan hal itu sehingga kebenaran nampak setelah ia tersembunyi sebelumnya dan ia pun tinggi menjulang setelah sebelumnya hilang dan ia berkumpul setelah sebelumnya bercerai berai mereka menuntun manusia kepada sunnah setelah mereka melupakannya sehingga manusia mengambil hukum dari hadits rasulillah n setelah mereka berhukum dengan perkataan si a dan si b walaupun perkataan tersebut menyelisihi rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
1702191 sesungguhnya jalan yang lurus bersama ahlul hadits dan kebenaran adalah apa yang mereka riwayatkan dan yang mereka nukil
1702192 kebenaran yang di dakwahkan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah suatu yang kita yakini dan kita jadikan manhaj akan tetapi allah tidak menghendaki kebenaran dan aqidah yang murni melainkan bersama ahlul hadits dan atsar karena mereka mengambil agama dan akidah mereka dari kholaf ulama yang datang setelah salaf ke salaf ulama yang terdahulu dari generasi ke generasi sampai kepada tabiin dan tabiin mengambil agama dari sahabat nabi n para sahabat mengambil agama dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka tidak ada jalan untuk mengetahui apa yang didakwahkan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kepada manusia dari agama yang murni dan jalan lurus kecuali dengan jalan yang dilalui oleh ahlul hadits adapun seluruh golongan golongan sesat mereka mencari agama dari jalan yang salah
1702193 jika aku melihat seorang dari ahlul hadits maka seakan akan aku melihat seorang dari sahabat nabi n
1702194 kalau saja bukan karena ahlul hadits sungguh kita menjadi penjual kacang
1702195 tidak ada kaum dimuka bumi yang lebih mulia dari pembawa tinta yaitu perowi hadits yang selalu membawa pena untuk menulis hadits pent mereka mencari atsar atsar rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan mencatatnya supaya tidak hilang
1702196 kedudukan apakah yang paling mulia aku berkata kedudukan anda wahai amirul mukminin dia berkata tahukah engkau siapa yang kedudukannya lebih mulia dariku aku berkata aku tidak tahu dia berkata tapi aku mengetahuinya dia adalah orang yang berada di suatu majelis dan berkata si fulan memberitahukan dari si fulan dari si fulan lalu dia berkata rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bersabda aku berkata wahai amirul mukminin bagaimana dia lebih baik dari anda sedangkan anda anak paman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam keturunan paman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang bernama abbas bin abdul muttholib z pen dan pemimpin kaum muslimin dia berkata ya celaka engkau dia lebih baik dariku karena namanya disebut beserta nama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dia tidak mati selamanya sedangkan kita mati dan binasa sedangkan ulama selalu ada dikenang sepanjang masa
1702197 sesungguhnya allah menahan bencana yang menimpa penduduk bumi dengan ahlul hadits
1702198 sesungguhnya orang yang fasik dari mereka lebih baik daripada ahli ibadah dari selain mereka
1702199 telah diketahui bahwasanya ahlul hadits dan sunnah adalah manusia yang paling dekat dengan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan pengikutnya mereka mendapatkan karunia dari allah dan kemuliaan dengan ilmu dan akal yang bersih serta pahala yang berlipat ganda yang tidak terdapat pada selain mereka
1702200 tidak diragukan lagi bahwasanya kaum muslimin yang paling banyak bersholawat kepada nabi n adalah ahlul hadits para perowi sunnah yang suci mereka mengemban ilmu yang mulia ini sehingga merekapun bersholawat di depan setiap hadits lisan mereka selalu basah dengan menyebutnya nama nabi dan bersholawat kepada beliau n

1702221 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1702222 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1702223 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1702224 it is possible to question the objectivity of the mandate of this independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities to gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1702225 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1702226 we continue to place our relationship with rwanda within this forward looking perspective
1702227 if you go to the report you will see for yourself how communication was done from the top leadership in paris to the embassy in kigali and how different people who had a role in the genocide were housed at the embassy residence
1702228 the role played by france in the aftermath to protect the genocidal forces and make it very difficult for them to be apprehended and brought to justice
1702229 this should be clear that this report will not go lie down put in store somewhere this report will be used
1702230 it will help in bringing to justice making very serious attempts to bring to justice people who were involved in committing genocide in this country

1702238 the sydney star observer a gay rights publication with an avowed
1702239 marriage is not for be but i believe same sex marriage should be allowed 89 now 88 suggests something more sinister that you are willfully and deliberately misleading people
1702240 my actual statements on transsexuals are as one would imagine less about stigma and denigration and more about the need for understanding
1702241 the first mainstream article i had published was actually a pro brokeback mountain opinion editorial in the australian and the second was an opinion editorial in the same paper decrying homophobia defending conservative commentator alan jones
1702242 in an earlier version of his piece potts called me a
1702243 comments elsewhere have suggested that i might be hiv positive i am not someone who has experienced child sex abuse at the hands of a priest and enjoyed that abuse i have not been abused and the suggestion is highly offensive insensitive and or that i have regularly been seen at sex on site venues picking up male prostitutes again untrue
1702244 if i were as isolated and opposed as potts claims id never get a hearing i wouldnt deserve one
1702245 certainly it is to counter pottss most earnest claim difficult to argue that people who oppose
1702246 finally pottss interpretation of the findings of the private lives report is not convincing the report is online for anyone to read
1702247 we recently ran two polls on the dna website asking two questions about gay marriage with the results of both showing a large majority were in favour of gay marriage for themselves and for society
1702248 our polls were then cited by heard on his blog with him concluding that 89 per cent of our respondents had said marriage was not for them whether he inadvertently or deliberately misinterpreted the results heard is mistaken in his analysis of these dna polls
1702249 the results showed that 68 per cent of respondents would marry their same sex partner if they could while the remaining 32 per cent would not even if they could we then asked only that minority of people who said they would not marry if they could if they supported the idea of gay marriage for others with 88 per cent saying they supported the idea for others
1702250 listening to dreadnought talking to an enchanted audience on being
1702251 there wont be a gay gene there isnt a theft gene if we focus on the act not the general feeling i find it implausible
1702252 the church cannot be wrong about human nature the church says that homosexualitys psychological genesis remains unexplained but that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered since they close the sexual act to the gift of life and do not preceed from genuine affective complementarity you cant rationally choose sodomy because its not good for you the inclination itself doesnt make sense in what god wants for us we cant ignore the things that make us fully human
1702253 plain procreative sex is in various ways still good even if it is neither cerebral nor particularly romantic the trouble with homogenital acts however is that the procreative the properly conjugal end of the sex organs is subverted it doesnt matter how much you love your buddy hes not going to fulfil his telos by virtue of you inserting your penis in his digestive tract

1702255 the sexual innuendo i mentioned relates to his ad hominem attacks regarding pictures ive posted here of my friend gay dad
1702256 complain of being burnt out by and or chewed up and spat out of the gay scene
1702257 while a few homoactivists think that gay marriage is a human right and a most pressing issue most good people disagree instead the pope spoke in very powerful terms about the transcendent nature of the human person
1702258 a gay man who has been disenchanted with his church
1702259 when he looked at me it felt like i was part of the church like we are all part of the church and that we all are important no matter who we are
1702260 how wrong homoactivists and others are when they claim that the pope and bishops those who exercise teaching pastoral authority in the catholic church are necessarily aloof from the lives of same sex attracted men and women
1702261 it seems gay marriage has become a human rights issue but not because it is a human right rather all this talk might actually harm the progress of human freedom
1702262 why the topic for discussion is same sex marriage a human rights issue provides us with a quick answer
1702263 that question mark right at the end certainly alerts us to the fact that people are uneasy no one not even its loudest advocates and careful sympathetic bodies like the young lawyers seems to be convinced that gay marriage really is a human right
1702264 did good people ask barack obama the black us presidential candidate whether racial equality was a human rights issue no anyone in his or her right mind listening to the inner voice of conscience and compassion knows that it is
1702265 would the venerable law society of nsw have asked the millions who suffered in the past under tyranny and those who continue to cry out today for freedom of association of religion for the right to free speech would anyone dare to ask these people if their precious freedoms are real
1702266 if a vast majority of serious and compassionate people still doubt whether or not gay marriage is a human right then the answer is no
1702267 so the fact that we are gathered here today under this banner indicates right from the start that no one really believes that gay marriage is like racial equality it is not a human right like freedom of association or free speech good people are right to doubt it is not any kind of human right at all
1702268 however gay marriage seems to have become sadly a human rights issue
1702269 certainly it distracts us as a community from more urgent problems
1702270 because as we come here today to debate a half forgotten topic that the vast majority of australians reject in a city where mardi gras shrinks and hiv aids infections too often rise in a world that faces many serious pressing challenges these other problems go untouched
1702271 what is worse im concerned that by dragging the name of human rights into the midst of the so called culture wars gay marriage events like this one do nothing to help real human rights advocates
1702272 the conflict between gay marriage and the advancement of human rights is enough to make anyone wonder
1702273 it is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if gay marriage is not perhaps part of a new ideology insidious and hidden which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man
1702274 theres also the bullshit factor rather than a debate on the merits of competing climate change policies or the plight of the long suffering first nations and how australia might apologise to the stolen generation weve been gathered instead and at great cost to talk about whether or not elton john can marry his boyfriend
1702275 today if we put aside our minor differences and embrace a more humane vision this becomes a space where peace begins to make sense where hope reigns
1702276 imagine if the homoactivist speakers used their talents to save the lives of same sex attracted men sentenced to hang in iran
1702277 imagine if christian conservatives and gay rights activists worked together on teen suicide drug addiction and hiv aids imagine my friends if all the effort wasted on gay marriage were channelled instead into strengthening personal relationships in ensuring that the gay community is no longer a place of ridicule and division but a true family characterised by compassion solidarity and hope
1702278 perhaps then the understandable longing some people feel for acceptance and legal recognition would find a better target than gay marriage real love not mere tolerance would be available
1702279 after all human rights belong to people because were human beings our humanity does not ask for permission rather it demands recognition and dignity
1702280 the question mark over this entire event organised by a serious and compassionate group like the law society of nsw demonstrates neatly why gay marriage has unfortunately and dangerously become a human rights issue
1702281 and also why it is not indeed a human right
1702282 marriage and the family so central to and productive of the culture of life are threatened by attempts to force gay marriage laws extreme forms of civil union and various sorts of radical relationship registries upon an otherwise apathetic if not overwhelmingly opposed general population
1702283 indeed many times when homoactivists appeared to have scored some victory or other in the gay marriage debate in australia quick decisive and humane activity by various notable and other less obvious leaders writers politicians and others of goodwill helped to raise a groundswell of public awareness
1702284 on three occasions such action has led directly to the defeat of gay marriage proposals in australia
1702285 prime minister rudd found many of the arguments advanced by homoactivists less than convincing in light of the solid well researched and compassionate arguments put by those including those who lead australias largest trade union the sda who work for the protection expansion and edification of the family
1702286 it is proof of how christian ideas are incredibly persuasive especially when buttressed by academically rigorous arguments open to the latest empirical research
1702287 to ensure that the brumby governments hasty partnerships legislation achieves the best possible outcome for the people of this state you must sit up you must resolve to become involved then to share your g d given talents in a great common pool to build a force an irresistible force that draws along the best and brightest elements of our society and catches the interest of everyday voters
1702288 while catholic lawyers cannot advocate for any change that would further wound the position of the family or dilute the importance of marriage we cannot simply throw up our arms and refuse to get involved when things dont go our way
1702289 it is important to point out the least offensive aspects of the current brumby legislation before demonstrating how the whole package can be improved
1702290 it is better for instance that this current bill recognises rather than creates a relationship at law that it excludes for the moment gay adoption and in contrast to the thrice defeated act model that it does not seek to introduce marriage mimicking ceremonies
1702291 however there are a number of problems that should be at the very least ironed out if the bill is to become law these include
1702292 there are problems with giving any de facto relationship the same standing as marriages such attempts weaken the family
1702293 the campaign against gay marriage is then part of the broader campaign for an increase in marital stability and family cohesion in the western world
1702294 the good news is that unlike in that broader struggle we need not wait for a radical transformation of culture to make a lasting impact for good
1702295 if there is to be a relationship register it simply should not have an explicit or even an implicit sex test
1702296 rather why not open the thing up at the highest levels to all worthy interdependent relationships carers old friends long term cohabiting brothers and sisters etc
1702297 currently brumbys proposal does not even rely on cohabitation rather it asks for proof that the parties form a couple providing financial support of a domestic nature
1702298 this is a mistake that must be resisted not least because it is ridiculous
1702299 but a sex test must also be rejected because it is not what most same sex attracted men need
1702300 because at a basic level and for whatever reason sexual encounters between self identified gay males simply do not often correlate with long term relationship forming behaviour
1702301 the truth is that most same sex attracted men while often sexually active are not in fact in any kind of companionate relationship at all and the vast majority of those who are do not indicate any plan to formalise these relationships
1702302 in an age when hiv infection rates are on the increase most alarmingly among inner city gay identified male populations in victoria and queensland and drug use remains a serious shocking problem there are certainly more pressing ethical and practical issues that face ordinary same sex attracted men and women than whether or not john brumby registers their sexual encounters and properly private financial arrangements
1702303 indeed many same sex attracted men and women find the very notion of gay marriage and relationship registration irrelevant if not deeply offensive
1702304 as it stands brumbys proposal certainly seems to militate in a most hurtful way against the flourishing of same sex attracted men and women
1702305 thus the deletion of a sex test would remove these most serious objections to a relationship register in victoria
1702306 writing about a similar impasse in san francisco in the 1990s an american vatican news specialist explained that rather than forfeit government funding to the bay areas catholic charities the citys then archbishop pushed to have the benefits extended to
1702307 this politically moderate socially compassionate and apparently orthodox model has since been urged by catholic bishops and groups in seattle new jersey san juan and even adelaide where archbishop philip wilson lent his support to the 2006 south australian so called partnerships legislation that recognised a whole range of worthy interdependent relationships
1702308 it is a model that goes some way to meeting the legitimate needs of real same sex attracted men and women without reducing their relationships to sex acts and properly private financial arrangements
1702309 it is the only model catholic lawyers and other people of good will should support
1702310 the sexual innuendo i mentioned relates to his ad hominem attacks please do not think i assail anyone on personal grounds without provocation regarding pictures ive posted here of my friend gay dad fr joe frequently returns to these when his wider arguments fail he describes them again here and on other sites that he thinks i dont read as examples of my apparent interest in bdsm this is outrageous
1702311 complain of being burnt out by and or chewed up and spat out of the gay scene
1702312 while a few homoactivists think that gay marriage is a human right and a most pressing issue most good people disagree instead the pope spoke in very powerful terms about the transcendent nature of the human person
1702313 a gay man who has been disenchanted with his church
1702314 when he looked at me it felt like i was part of the church like we are all part of the church and that we all are important no matter who we are
1702315 how wrong homoactivists and others are when they claim that the pope and bishops those who exercise teaching pastoral authority in the catholic church are necessarily aloof from the lives of same sex attracted men and women
1702316 it seems gay marriage has become a human rights issue but not because it is a human right rather all this talk might actually harm the progress of human freedom
1702317 why the topic for discussion is same sex marriage a human rights issue provides us with a quick answer
1702318 that question mark right at the end certainly alerts us to the fact that people are uneasy no one not even its loudest advocates and careful sympathetic bodies like the young lawyers seems to be convinced that gay marriage really is a human right
1702319 did good people ask barack obama the black us presidential candidate whether racial equality was a human rights issue no anyone in his or her right mind listening to the inner voice of conscience and compassion knows that it is
1702320 would the venerable law society of nsw have asked the millions who suffered in the past under tyranny and those who continue to cry out today for freedom of association of religion for the right to free speech would anyone dare to ask these people if their precious freedoms are real
1702321 if a vast majority of serious and compassionate people still doubt whether or not gay marriage is a human right then the answer is no
1702322 so the fact that we are gathered here today under this banner indicates right from the start that no one really believes that gay marriage is like racial equality it is not a human right like freedom of association or free speech good people are right to doubt it is not any kind of human right at all
1702323 however gay marriage seems to have become sadly a human rights issue
1702324 certainly it distracts us as a community from more urgent problems
1702325 because as we come here today to debate a half forgotten topic that the vast majority of australians reject in a city where mardi gras shrinks and hiv aids infections too often rise in a world that faces many serious pressing challenges these other problems go untouched
1702326 what is worse im concerned that by dragging the name of human rights into the midst of the so called culture wars gay marriage events like this one do nothing to help real human rights advocates
1702327 the conflict between gay marriage and the advancement of human rights is enough to make anyone wonder
1702328 it is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if gay marriage is not perhaps part of a new ideology insidious and hidden which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man
1702329 theres also the bullshit factor rather than a debate on the merits of competing climate change policies or the plight of the long suffering first nations and how australia might apologise to the stolen generation weve been gathered instead and at great cost to talk about whether or not elton john can marry his boyfriend
1702330 today if we put aside our minor differences and embrace a more humane vision this becomes a space where peace begins to make sense where hope reigns
1702331 imagine if the homoactivist speakers used their talents to save the lives of same sex attracted men sentenced to hang in iran
1702332 imagine if christian conservatives and gay rights activists worked together on teen suicide drug addiction and hiv aids imagine my friends if all the effort wasted on gay marriage were channelled instead into strengthening personal relationships in ensuring that the gay community is no longer a place of ridicule and division but a true family characterised by compassion solidarity and hope
1702333 perhaps then the understandable longing some people feel for acceptance and legal recognition would find a better target than gay marriage real love not mere tolerance would be available
1702334 after all human rights belong to people because were human beings our humanity does not ask for permission rather it demands recognition and dignity
1702335 the question mark over this entire event organised by a serious and compassionate group like the law society of nsw demonstrates neatly why gay marriage has unfortunately and dangerously become a human rights issue
1702336 and also why it is not indeed a human right
1702337 marriage and the family so central to and productive of the culture of life are threatened by attempts to force gay marriage laws extreme forms of civil union and various sorts of radical relationship registries upon an otherwise apathetic if not overwhelmingly opposed general population
1702338 indeed many times when homoactivists appeared to have scored some victory or other in the gay marriage debate in australia quick decisive and humane activity by various notable and other less obvious leaders writers politicians and others of goodwill helped to raise a groundswell of public awareness
1702339 on three occasions such action has led directly to the defeat of gay marriage proposals in australia
1702340 prime minister rudd found many of the arguments advanced by homoactivists less than convincing in light of the solid well researched and compassionate arguments put by those including those who lead australias largest trade union the sda who work for the protection expansion and edification of the family
1702341 it is proof of how christian ideas are incredibly persuasive especially when buttressed by academically rigorous arguments open to the latest empirical research
1702342 to ensure that the brumby governments hasty partnerships legislation achieves the best possible outcome for the people of this state you must sit up you must resolve to become involved then to share your g d given talents in a great common pool to build a force an irresistible force that draws along the best and brightest elements of our society and catches the interest of everyday voters
1702343 while catholic lawyers cannot advocate for any change that would further wound the position of the family or dilute the importance of marriage we cannot simply throw up our arms and refuse to get involved when things dont go our way
1702344 it is important to point out the least offensive aspects of the current brumby legislation before demonstrating how the whole package can be improved
1702345 it is better for instance that this current bill recognises rather than creates a relationship at law that it excludes for the moment gay adoption and in contrast to the thrice defeated act model that it does not seek to introduce marriage mimicking ceremonies
1702346 however there are a number of problems that should be at the very least ironed out if the bill is to become law
1702347 there are problems with giving any de facto relationship the same standing as marriages
1702348 the campaign against gay marriage is then part of the broader campaign for an increase in marital stability and family cohesion in the western world
1702349 the good news is that unlike in that broader struggle we need not wait for a radical transformation of culture to make a lasting impact for good
1702350 if there is to be a relationship register it simply should not have an explicit or even an implicit sex test
1702351 rather why not open the thing up at the highest levels to all worthy interdependent relationships carers old friends long term cohabiting brothers and sisters etc
1702352 currently brumbys proposal does not even rely on cohabitation rather it asks for proof that the parties form a couple providing financial support of a domestic nature
1702353 this is a mistake that must be resisted not least because it is ridiculous
1702354 but a sex test must also be rejected because it is not what most same sex attracted men need
1702355 because at a basic level and for whatever reason sexual encounters between self identified gay males simply do not often correlate with long term relationship forming behaviour
1702356 the truth is that most same sex attracted men while often sexually active are not in fact in any kind of companionate relationship at all and the vast majority of those who are do not indicate any plan to formalise these relationships
1702357 in an age when hiv infection rates are on the increase most alarmingly among inner city gay identified male populations in victoria and queensland and drug use remains a serious shocking problem there are certainly more pressing ethical and practical issues that face ordinary same sex attracted men and women than whether or not john brumby registers their sexual encounters and properly private financial arrangements
1702358 indeed many same sex attracted men and women find the very notion of gay marriage and relationship registration irrelevant if not deeply offensive
1702359 as it stands brumbys proposal certainly seems to militate in a most hurtful way against the flourishing of same sex attracted men and women
1702360 thus the deletion of a sex test would remove these most serious objections to a relationship register in victoria
1702361 writing about a similar impasse in san francisco in the 1990s an american vatican news specialist explained that rather than forfeit government funding to the bay areas catholic charities the citys then archbishop pushed to have the benefits extended to
1702362 this politically moderate socially compassionate and apparently orthodox model has since been urged by catholic bishops and groups in seattle new jersey san juan and even adelaide where archbishop philip wilson lent his support to the 2006 south australian so called partnerships legislation that recognised a whole range of worthy interdependent relationships
1702363 it is a model that goes some way to meeting the legitimate needs of real same sex attracted men and women without reducing their relationships to sex acts and properly private financial arrangements
1702364 it is the only model catholic lawyers and other people of good will should support
1702365 i would merely point out that it is much the same as querying the vaticans view on artificial contraception having effectively lost the latter battle in the court of catholic opinion the vatican seem to be losing the former as well
1702366 one could argue that marriage is a mutable social and legal construct the fact that the catholic church sees in its formal definition of marriage something immutable pre legal as in temporally prior to government and law and sacramental and illustrative of the nuptial images in the jewish amp christian scriptures shows if nothing else that the church has a formal and realizable definition of marriage
1702367 my seminarian friends get a special look in their eyes every time someone mentions the spirit of the second vatican council
1702368 the church grows by constantly releasing new and old heresies from herself
1702369 they were free to believe what is now heresy because it had not yet been defined
1702370 an interesting thought exercise would be to bring back the whole question say a hundred years contraception and abortion werent easily available were there millions of illegal abortions for which the church was not yet to blame
1702371 take away brothels and what disorders will ensue in human affairs
1702372 are we no longer able to take responsibility for our sexuality and i dont mean by contracepting i mean by saying no to things we want to do i dont think the human person has changed despite changes in society
1702373 as for the church fathers as a friend of mine put it the other day
1702374 so i would say that orthodoxy is continually being narrowed and deepened to use your analogy were eliminating more errors and understanding more truth
1702375 the church teaches 1 not to have sex outside of marriage 2 not to use contraceptives 3 not to abort children the author claims that people are ignoring the church on 1 and 3 yet following 2 without giving any real reasons for why he supposes this to be the case
1702376 faces up to human nature as it is with its imperfections
1702377 if i were arguing for abortion for womens rights i wouldnt cite an instance where a girl has an abortion in order to facilitate her brothers marriage
1702378 smith mcinerny and pope john paul ii their thought is brought to perfection in catholicism isnt it
1702379 if you want to argue that we should tolerate everything except intolerance
1702380 most of my generation has realized that its easier to rebel by throwing over the church altogether
1702381 as a catholic my ideal is obviously marriage and the famiily
1702382 if there are persons with this predisposition the state can adopt the opportune regulations even if i think the concept of homosexual marriage is mistaken since it puts it on the same plane as marriage between man and woman

1702488 the security of nigeria was ably identified as one of the cardinal pillars in the agenda of this administration and it is in this regard that our support for security forces has remained unbending
1702489 the inclusion of security in the seven point agenda sent out a message to the effect that a stable vibrant and prosperous economy can never be attained in an atmosphere of chaos violence and lawlessness
1702490 as a government we will not make excuses it is our responsibility to respond to the yearnings of our people who desire better policing
1702491 and this calls for an urgent need for officers of the nigeria police force to constantly be kept abreast with developments
1702492 every member of the board of trustees bot can aspire to chair the board as against the current provision that limits the chairmanship to former holders of certain offices
1702493 the nec also resolved to propose an amendment to the provisions of the partys constitution that deals with the leadership membership and functions of the board of trustees bot
1702494 nec also resolved on the reconstitution of the bot in line with the proposed amendments a special national convention of the party shall hold in the first quarter of 2009 to consider these constitutional amendment proposals
1702495 how best the party can revert to the original values and principles on which the party was founded
1702496 brainstorm digest and proffer advice over key issues that will put the party ahead of its rivals the think tank shall work with the peoples democratic institute pdi and relevant agencies of government
1702497 it has therefore been the cause of disillusionment agitations and indiscipline within the nigeria police force after due consideration of this administrations avowed commitment to the rule of law and in order to guarantee a level playing field for all members of the police force the commission re examined the guidelines for promotion for all the ranks ranging from deputy inspector general of police to constable

1702609 with these latest figures nigeria has taken a bold lead in africa in terms of telephone availability to the population and we must congratulate ourselves on this development this means that more and more nigerians are having access to telephone facilities which is one of the main objectives of the commission
1702610 the actual reason behind somebody using more than one phone is because mobile phones here are used for home office and mobility service because nigeria did not have the benefit of developing the landline infrastructure until mobile phone services caught up
1702611 while we acknowledge the continued existence of quality of service challenges we have observed that the operators have continued to expand their services and some marginal improvements have been observed
1702612 but we are not resting in our oars as we shall continue to impress on the operators of their responsibilities to improve on this situation
1702613 this calls for attention and we must rise up to the challenge of providing services that address the needs and concerned of this group

1702649 the importation of bagged cement recently approved by government is a warn off exercise aimed at ameliorating the sufferings of nigeria
1702650 the president is concerned with the pains of the consumers and has directed that the issuance for importation of cement should be restricted to only firms that meet the requirement of the policy on cement
1702651 you are aware that cement has always played pivotal role in the lives of most nigerians it would therefore be irresponsible on the part of government to ignore the incessant increase on the price of the commodity

1702679 hes the oldest celebrity it the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1702680 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1702681 shes got a sense of humor a thoughtful energy policy and nearly as much federal legislative experience as barry o if grotesque overexposure and grandiose ego are now prerequisites for the presidency then the choice is actually the choice still isnt clear is it
1702682 takeaway even leftwing comedy writers hopelessly in the bag for barack obama struggle to find any sense in obamas doctrinaire no drilling no way policy
1702683 all things considered while thinking back to the clinton years and of how paris secured her infamy is america really ready for a president who does her best work on the other side of the desk and would be constantly loading it up on to youtube as well

1702697 the president swore to discharge the duties of his office in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and the laws of the federal republic of nigeria and this efcc act that he has violated is one of such laws
1702698 it is therefore our contention that having consented to abide by his oath of office the president should not be selective about the laws to obey
1702699 even if they say that he was never re confirmed by the senate reconfirmation of re appointment by the senate is not a precondition under section 3 1 of efcc act 2004 which provided for re appointment moreover counsel to the 3rd defendant had violated the provisions of section 97 c of the evidence act by tendering uncertified documents as evidence before the court

1702734 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1702735 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1702736 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1702737 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1702738 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1702739 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1702740 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections

1702968 as far as we know foreigners gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that
1702969 we have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of china
1702970 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1702971 when we got back to the house a young boy told us he had seen asiba lying on a footpath next to the road
1702972 we immediately went there and i saw it was definitely her she was dead my wife was crying i did not kill her
1702973 we spent the whole day in the tavern drinking and meitjie and i were quite drunk she meitjie started kissing another man and i got angry with her and we both left the tavern at 5pm
1702974 meitjie ran away to her aunts place and i kept the children with me after i prepared supper for the children we all went to sleep in the same bed with the exception of asiba who was still finishing her supper
1702975 i went outside with the baby and checked around the back of the house and in the toilet but she was nowhere to be seen
1702976 if im sitting in a board room deciding where to put millions of dollars well there are other choices
1702977 hes very picky in what endorsements and products he associates with anyway
1702978 and i think the endorsement world is less of a concern with him than cooperstown right now
1702979 it keeps athletes involved in the event while giving fans something else to watch for
1702980 should it come down to the last couple of tournaments it can add some drama

1703013 the disbanding of the dso would amount to serious and unjustified violations of the rule of law and the constitution and breach the states constitutional obligations
1703014 the bills suffer from incurable deficiencies and should not be approved by the committees
1703015 most worrying though is the bills concentrate an enormous amount of power in the national commissioner of the sa police service

1703019 should a single worker lose a job the ministers will have to go they are making us pay for mistakes committed by other fellows
1703020 the government ministers have proven their inefficiency beyond no reasonable doubt
1703021 earlier in the year when there was an electricity crisis part of the problem eskom had was the depletion of coal stockpiles which formed part of the discussions between labour eskom the government and the mining industry
1703022 but the strike today by the people will affect the production of coal mining companies which ultimately has an impact on eskoms success in generating electricity
1703023 you cant put a rand value on what it has done to our image i believe the strike is the second story on the bbc today
1703024 theres a difference between a strike in manufacturing and a strike in services with manufacturing the impact will always be more severe

1703031 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1703032 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1703033 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1703034 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine

1703044 we will assess all of the options and i think all of you have written or read about pretty much every conceivable one
1703045 one that ought to be thought about really as a benchmark lets say would just be operating it and seeing if the cash flow from that operation is superior to any yield we can get putting it into alignment with some of the usual suspects that theyre mentioning
1703046 there continue to be encouraging signs about the underlying health of the business

1703054 where coupons become a currency it reflects the rapidly falling value of the zimbabwe dollar barter selling provides something that holds its value

1703056 the petrol coupon has a more stable value and barter works

1703059 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1703060 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1703061 its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1703062 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1703063 my understanding is that fans will be issued with a coloured tag to wear around their neck or on their clothing
1703064 this is to identify them as being part of an organised group if they do misbehave then they can be pointed out and easily identified as being part of an organised group
1703065 stena line will be introducing coloured lanyards to football clubs when they travel
1703066 these lanyards will only be colour specific and will not identify individuals nor will they reveal which supporters club they are from
1703067 there have been other multiparty patch releases but never has there been one on such a massive scale it took someone with the gravitas and reputation of kaminsky to pull together the affected parties
1703068 well actually that is not true our snmp case was secret for nine months after reporting it to relevant vendors and as far as i know it involved more than 100 vendors and other organizations 1 000 people we saw all possible attempts to disclose it but even public disclosure lists appreciated the stand that cert us chose to take
1703069 i think everybody should come to minneapolis its the most beautiful city in the united states and everybody is going to want to come here i think it will be tough to keep away from this city its going to be so great
1703070 everyone should come to minneapolis for the republican convention its a great city
1703071 all the candidates from the dfl and gop debate farm issues
1703072 reps michele bachmann and john kline gop incumbents in the sixth and second didnt attend citing scheduling conflicts
1703073 the most dangerous man in america daniel ellsberg and the pentagon papers
1703074 how happy they were to have a place to live and how much they were trying to get their life together one tenant named jeffrey is very verbal and clear about who he is and was and then we see him out on the street selling a voucher from his therapist they reveal themselves
1703075 i think that all but three of our main subjects are drug addicts
1703076 they say they are recovering but theyre not they are trying but its not an easy thing to give up
1703077 we make films we like and then we send them to the world on spec
1703078 he helped mcnamara plan bombing strategy in vietnam he was one of the architects he was not an insignificant player how does one get from that point to risking life in prison and excommunication from his circle of colleagues by leaking a top secret document that he knew could land him in prison
1703079 nixon was acting like a king and lyndon johnson before him they felt like they were entirely justified to operate in secrecy if you had to narrow down the essential political issue of the pentagon papers leak its national security versus the peoples right to know clearly in 2008 these are issues in our country were debating on a daily basis thats not going to change with the election
1703080 she had a bunch of meetings and things planned including meetings for her own line but shes postponed everything shes completely thrilled this is something shes wanted for a very long time
1703081 i think it took me away from our players i was doing scripts practice plans and game plans the hours were just unbelievable
1703082 all three can lead this team to victory and all three have great skill it doesnt matter to us who plays
1703083 we have a lot of seniors and everyone is taking personal responsibility to play their best every day every practice and every game
1703084 i have to be a leader not only vocal but we lost some big names off of last years team its time for some others including me to step up
1703085 im ready to play this year were not foolin around i havent made any bones about it i expect us to be good

1703088 why did the artist include these dishes in front of the paintings
1703089 screw it this is exactly what the artist wanted and they are just waiting to see if people will be willing to transgress social protocol and actually interact with the artwork break this aesthetic taboo against
1703090 oh so thats what were supposed to do with it
1703091 thats not what those are for please dont disturb the pieces
1703092 are you alright with that leaving the pieces undisturbed because you dont look alright with that
1703093 i certainly wasnt trying to impersonate him i have such high esteem for the guy that honestly i would feel so bad if he was in any way offended because it wasnt my intention
1703094 we knew we were locked into a r rating from the language in the beginning of the movie anyway from all the war movie dialog you just have to do that if youre doing a war movie i think a lot of these studio guys talk like that i know from personal experience i have heard people in movie studios curse
1703095 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days mccain and im not promising change like that other guy obama im just hot but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1703096 and now i want to present my energy policy for america just after i finish reading this article on where i can fly to get the best tan oh maui
1703097 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
1703098 its about time i get whats owed to me from the situation i was stuck in
1703099 its unfortunate things have turned out the way they did but artists deserve to be compensated fairly by their labels for the work they do and that wasnt happenin in my case im happy to finally be a free man and make a new start
1703100 there were some internal discussions the reality being that judd is somewhat against marijuana use and i think it should be legal we didnt really want to make a strong overall message about it we kind of wanted to leave it to the audience
1703101 being a champion meant staying at the same hotel as the white athletes it did not mean going in the front door
1703102 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
1703103 fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the imprimatur of acceptability by the television industry
1703104 the parents television council wont be satisfied with television content until they convince the government to enforce their personal selective judgments
1703105 better than most in showing positive portrayals of marital relations and intimacy
1703106 not to my knowledge i dont answer my phone i have one i dont even have the number
1703107 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1703108 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1703109 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1703110 people are saying its woody allens steamiest movie im thinking
1703111 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1703112 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1703113 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1703114 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1703115 its to the point now man were tired of it here in the locker room just hearing about it
1703116 hopefully they get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of the questions coming to us
1703117 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1703118 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1703119 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1703120 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1703121 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1703122 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1703123 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1703124 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1703125 he has a lot going through his head and i think hes emotional
1703126 and just talking to him hes in a tough spot
1703127 thats not a good feeling but i dont view it that way
1703128 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations and i dont feel thats the case
1703129 wed do something horrible to them or leave them somewhere
1703130 it is a great joy to build a car and know exactly how much fun customers will have with it
1703131 a little success makes you want to try harder a lot of success makes you want to blow the doors off the competition again which were poised to do with the new intensified infiniti g lineup for 2009
1703132 year after year we strive to offer our customers one of the freshest product lineups in the industry which weve done again in 2009 with the new second generation infiniti fx upcoming g convertible and the enhanced g37 coupe and g37 sedan
1703133 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1703134 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1703135 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1703136 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this
1703137 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1703138 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1703139 the final product will be a system for validating the performance of the antennas and readers for rfid environments in manufacturing distribution retail and defense industries the
1703140 auto id sensor networks provide rfid systems with the ability to manage data collected from a networks edge
1703141 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1703142 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1703143 was reduced to pg 13 after first being rated r
1703144 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree
1703145 and anybody who is going is not going to be surprised by what they see
1703146 n o podemos deixar que a cidade volte a ser assolada pela corrup o de fiscais que ocorreu durante a gest o do prefeito celso pitta 1997 2000 tem de ficar claro para a popula o o que houve dentro daquela subprefeitura
1703147 a coragem de abrir os arquivos para saber onde est o os desaparecidos
1703148 tomar cuidado ao falar sobre quest es de direitos humanos porque ele foi o respons vel pela deporta o dos dois boxeadores cubanos

1703168 i stood among them and the tombs which were all covered with carvings of their faces and with dust and i heard nothing but quiet and spiders sometimes it would rain outside and the water might trickle in occasionally the door would open for another one who would enter head first and on the back i could see thick stone columns and the tombs very faintly from the light that shone under the door i heard footsteps coming very faintly near then they were close heavy and uneven i saw a shadow appear in the strip of light under the door all but blocking it totally the door began crashing in its frame as whatever it was on the other side was battering it and i knew that the door would give way and something insanely violent will come bursting through

1703281 i have finished that chapter in my life now because i have known from the start that they would not count on me
1703282 we know where we missed out last season probably through our home form more than anything
1703283 the four teams who were bottom of the league came here and took the 12 points
1703284 you put those 12 points on our tally at the end of the season youre in the play offs virtually
1703285 we know what weve got to do were willing to do it and weve got the players to do it
1703286 i think weve got a better squad of players than last year and we had a good squad then
1703287 i dont think youre going to have a runaway team in this championship its going to be the same as last season
1703288 everybody can beat everybody its just about getting a bit of consistency
1703289 luciano has felt a bit of tightness in his hamstring so well see how he responds in training
1703290 his name was mentioned but weve got to look at the make up of the team
1703291 well look at whether we need an additional player like robbie and make a decision at that time
1703292 fortunately or unfortunately depending on which way you look at it i think weve got three or four great captains at the club
1703293 his name was mentioned but weve got to look at the make up of the team
1703294 well look at whether we need an additional player like robbie and make a decision at that time
1703295 he would be a good addition to the club with his experience character and past here
1703296 at the moment we dont know what kind of a pre season hes had or how much preparation he has had chance to do
1703297 but i would think its a long shot for him to be involved on saturday
1703298 obviously talks have between the two clubs have been going on a for a few weeks and during that time
1703299 hes got a lot of ability you can see that and i think hes going to be a fantastic addition to us
1703300 i have a chance to be seeded and thats my goal its a huge difference if you are seeded at the us open or not because you can play rafael nadal in the first round
1703301 i think i am playing pretty well for this first match it was a pretty good performance i just need to stay aggressive and move on from here
1703302 after two weeks when i lost in the second and first rounds and against an opponent like isner who is not easy to play i was pretty solid
1703303 honestly i think its difficult because although there are going to be completely new rules next year there could be changes but ive never seen a car thats fighting at the back one year then sweep the field the next
1703304 its always step by step so its hard to close the gap whether its the aerodynamics the engine or the tyres whatever our problems are wed have to work very hard to close that gap
1703305 it wasnt a very taxing game for him really but hes done okay you can see he knows what its about
1703306 i just wanted to play him in the game and ill take it from there
1703307 im glad to come up here for bully and for stafford to help them out it was a run out for some of our players quite competitive but wed expect that team to beat stafford
1703308 its good that my friend has done this im very happy to see him stay its very important he remains at portsmouth we know he is a very good player and he can turn a game around sometimes
1703309 he can do things he can perform tricky things that can win you the match you want players like that on your team hes a very important player i think everybody knows that we have all seen what he can do he won us the fa cup
1703310 im delighted we want to keep our best players and he is one of them
1703311 im starting to worry about whether we are going to have a team ready for the start of the season because nani is suspended anderson is at the olympics and i doubt if we will get rooney fit after the virus he has had
1703312 he picked it up in nigeria and its not a nice one its 12 days until the season starts and hes not been able to train
1703313 that is a team you would look at and say immediately it would be an honour for anyone to lead
1703314 england rugby has always been regardless whether it is the era as world cup winners finishing second or being knocked out in the quarter finals as we were in 1999 a team full of promise incredible work rate belief effort collective respect and trust
1703315 i have captained the side not as many times as others but i have always really enjoyed the job because you just have this feeling when you look at the guys around you and you think it is a pleasure to be here
1703316 you have a huge faith that these guys are doing everything they can for you so it is east to reciprocate that
1703317 i am distraught it was only on tuesday that i found out that it was all over so it hasnt really sunk in yet
1703318 although im bitterly disappointed i think ill look back on my career and feel incredibly fortunate to have played alongside some truly great players
1703319 i won 12 trophies at leicester there was a five year period when we won everything there was to win we were the manchester united of rugby and i count myself very lucky to have been a part of that
1703320 leon is a fantastic professional a model for anyone wanting to reach the top in the sport and i thank him for the contribution he made to the squad last season
1703321 it is strange that someone has said there is systematic doping these situations are very unpleasant but to say it is systematic is premature
1703322 when in the united states they discovered the balco laboratories it was sad but they didnt say that the whole of us sport was involved in doping
1703323 were no closer to finding an assistant manager ferguson said
1703324 its always hard to replace good men and were taking our time with it
1703325 i dont want to leave and i havent been told anything that would make me think i would be leaving
1703326 unless it comes from the manager you learn to just block it out
1703327 weve been impressed with what hes done in pre season
1703328 he has shown flashes of what we think is a very exciting talent his quality is good and so is his attitude too
1703329 we are going to look at these two games coming up and also we need to remember that we have an intense period coming up
1703330 being one of the smaller clubs and thats no disrespect to us but i think once the bigger clubs start moving then the market tends to follow and things move on with it
1703331 one or two of the bigger clubs now have spent money and it just filters along then and the market starts moving
1703332 there will always be speculation about good players and vedran is a very good player
1703333 he had an exceptional european championships i cant elaborate any more because i dont know a great deal about it
1703334 we will have the phones ringing non stop but at the moment nobody is going out even on loan
1703335 at some stage some will go out to gain further experience but not for a few weeks
1703336 there are lots of good exciting attacking players here tonight
1703337 i had a good discussion with the guys and one of the key factors was about playing with passion and pride as if its your last test
1703338 i want them to come off at the end of the day having given their all for england to try and put smiles on the faces of people in this wonderful country
1703339 freddie ive spoken to at great lengths and he is happy to bat at six and ian bell wants the responsibility at three
1703340 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1703341 we urge that no impediments are put in its way and that its passage can come quickly and smoothly the issues in this bill are not controversial and they have broad bipartisan support attaching non germane issues to the veterans funding bill that serve to delay or block passage would truly be wrong
1703342 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1703343 i think the market realizes this kind of pressure from congress may in fact lead to a change in policy
1703344 to attack democrats for leaving town without doing something to lower gas prices
1703345 at one point the lights went off in the house and the microphones were turned off in the chamber meaning republicans were talking in the dark
1703346 bring the congress back lets have a real up or down vote
1703347 ive known mark schwarzer for a long time and played against him in the past

1703350 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1703351 this week mexicos senate urged president felipe calder n to press u s officials to delay the execution calder n did not respond to the senate request
1703352 the world courts jurisdiction also does not reach texas a state where authorities generally dont like outsiders telling them what to do

1703354 you would prefer a factually boring case to test the legal boundaries of the military commission system
1703355 the prosecutors dont want to fight over 9 11 defendants until after the system has shaken out the last thing you want is to retry the 9 11 hijackers should something happen on appeal you want to retry someone like hamdan

1703362 has from a factual and legal point of view a very substantial and uphill battle proving the charges against
1703363 theres a lot of youth at the club and a lot of good players personally ive been impressed with the young lads
1703364 a club like orient helps bring through young english players and give them a chance because you can get overlooked
1703365 the premier league teams can just buy talent so its good to see young players given a chance
1703366 you just want it to go as well as possible and id love to get off to a good start
1703367 its quite a tricky one with hereford being newly promoted so the pressures on us as its a home game so we want a good start

1703438 chris gray might not always get his man the way its drawn up but he almost always finds a way to get his man
1703439 we havent done enough yet and hes got to get in the game
1703440 but i really feel he is the player we thought he was when we drafted him
1703441 they want the line to drop their blocks at that point and head upfield why if the receiver fumbles theyll be in position to recover if the receiver gets stood up by defenders theyll come along and blast the pile if the ball is intercepted theyll be that much further downfield to make a tackle most of all it keeps them aggressive and pushing upfield its a small difference that may pay off once a game if so its worth it
1703442 wahles impact was felt almost immediately as he became a coach in the weight room during the offseason conditioning program during training camp practices wahle has displayed good mobility while pulling on screen passes and runs to the outside and a nasty streak while blocking on runs up the gut
1703443 i watched mike wahle for a while he gets very low in his stance for somebody as big as he is he doesnt do anything flashy but he looks awfully sound i never saw him get beat and he always stayed with his block until the whistle blew the coaches seem to love him and what he brings to the left side of the line
1703444 and really the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful every play is leonard
1703445 i was back there singing a gospel song and he was like leonard stop it
1703446 michaels running uphill the odds are against michael a little bit just from the nature of the veteran players and whos here and the roster size and all that
1703447 but clearly thats not affecting how hes going after it and i appreciate that i think you try and create spots for players either on special teams or in the return game who understand
1703448 i think in fairness you have to let those guys show and the scrimmage is actually the best place because the coaches arent there on the field its like a game and we see how theyve processed what weve done so far without help
1703449 jamar has performed well in camp and he really performed well saturday
1703450 well when youre in a scrimmage youre going to bang up some people you never know who and you never know what positions its football

1703467 bill i agree with you 99 99 of the time but on this you are 100 wrong your suggestion is tantamount to encouraging socialism whats next the automobile industry rebating to those who cant afford to buy a car
1703468 the oil companies give money away in order to create good will and make more money now thats capitalism
1703469 im appalled that you can so cavalierly propose to take away 2 of a portion of my retirement fund millions of us own oil company stock as a part of our stock portfolios
1703470 i find it unusual when obama wants to give americans 1 000 in energy relief if he is elected president and no one in the media wants to call it what it is a bribe
1703471 the oil companies record profits are driving the economy into the toilet if i sell a bag of ice for 20 during a hurricane i go to jail what gives
1703472 i object to your proposal in the free and fair america where i want to live i decide where to donate my disposable income
1703473 the oil companies are a business not a charity they already pay half their income in taxes meanwhile congress does nothing
1703474 nancy pelosi has become a dictator when is she going to be reigned in and perform as she is supposed to
1703475 cmon oreilly even nancy pelosi knows the opposite of progress is congress
1703476 as a working woman im embarrassed by the speaker of the houses behavior it should not be tolerated
1703477 thanks bill for exposing nancy pelosi and the political games shes playing at the expense of her constituency we are not blind we are watching
1703478 with speaker pelosi ignoring the peoples wishes and not bringing a vote on drilling can i make a citizens arrest for treason
1703479 i found it disturbing the speaker did not allow a vote on oil drilling is there anything the folks can do to force an up and down vote
1703480 the people are not being heard and the founders must be rolling in their graves
1703481 please tell me how ms pelosi has the power to disallow a vote of any kind especially one on off shore drilling she seems to have as much power as the president
1703482 maybe im missing something but isnt discussing why you arent discussing the john edwards situation in fact discussing it why not wait until all the facts are out before you discuss it at all
1703483 mr oreilly i believe you didnt report the details of john edwards personal problem because he generates ad revenue for your program by selling those awnings
1703484 i cant believe the national enquirer would write a story about one of the countrys leading trial lawyers without being able to back up every word of it
1703485 john edwards is not a private citizen the media right or wrong makes a living exposing flaws of those with elite status
1703486 john edwards is a public figure by choice but i agree with you if you cant verify the story it isnt news its gossip
1703487 your goat segment was a classic bait and switch flim flam
1703488 growing up my parents had fainting goats not only did they keep us entertained for hours they kept us out of trouble and taught us responsibility
1703489 i think those goats are fainting from political spin overload after a few nights of watching the factor im sure they would stay upright
1703490 are those fainting goats avoiding tough questions from the factor we need tonya reiman for some body language please
1703491 the pinhead goats segment was not for the faint of heart
1703492 i have a herd of 60 fainting goats and i have to come to their defense they are one of the most majestic and gentle creatures god ever created they are patriots
1703493 animals are not pinheads only humans can hold that title im very disappointed you felt it appropriate to belittle a helpless animal
1703494 you are fair and balanced and your high ratings are the prize

1703518 whats more obscene the official position that waterboarding is not torture or our official position that its a thrill ride
1703519 its not something to be made fun of its just something theyre trying to make a quick buck off i guess

1703530 the terrible thing for writers at the moment is the bbc they are such crap but its not just writers they are killing producers and production companies all over the place because they will put something into development and then sit on it for literally two years they the bbc staff are all salaried so they could not give a stuff they have all got their pensions and their holidays but in the meantime independent companies are really struggling and going under that is the worst thing about the bbc and they should hang their heads in shame
1703531 if we developed less then the response rate would certainly quicken but the number of opportunities available for writers would dramatically lessen making a drama as good as it can possibly be for the audience to enjoy sometimes takes time but this will always be our driving factor

1703559 we have recently adopted a policy of excluding sickly sentimentality which particularly when sung by certain vocalists can become nauseating and not at all in keeping with what we feel to be the need of the public in this country in the fourth year of war
1703560 this is a bad perversion of a chopin melody and should be barred
1703561 the chorus was my friend jack eats sugarlumps and the band tried to cover it up by pretending it was about a horse people didnt recognise the terminology on here comes the nice but there was an awareness of lysergic acid people knew those sugar lumps were not tate amp lyles
1703562 why not i asked mr naive i had to go and ask somebody i mean i knew about the action but i hadnt heard anyone use that phrase
1703563 people might now say fancy banning that but youre talking 1984 at the time i had a high profile i was the face of childrens tv there was a picture of a phallus on the back of the sleeve but the real reason it was banned was because of the video which featured simulated buggery and urinating into peoples mouths i dont think theyd allow that on childrens tv in 2008 either
1703564 judging by their censoring one would think that they got left behind from the victorian era
1703565 it is a well known fact that the public rushed to buy such a night on hearing of its ban i know several people who bought it for that reason alone
1703566 in a way you could argue that its gone too far
1703567 i quite like it that on local radio you still dont get four letter words
1703568 my heart and i have decided to end it all
1703569 a couple of days ago i came back to sao paulo i tried to forget the race at budapest but thats quite difficult
1703570 form then on i drove with very good rhythm i think you can count the laps lewis was faster than me on one hand
1703571 but in the end it was not my day when the engine failed i had a strange feeling it was like a nightmare and i wanted to wake up but i couldnt because i was already awake it was an incredible disappointment this sport can be really cruel
1703572 looking at the standigs at least i can stay calm because not even lewis won but we cant throw away points like that

1703577 dabei handelt es sich um oberfl chenstrukturen aus proteinen die f r die bakterien sehr wichtig sein m ssen da sie bis zu zehn prozent des gesamtproteins ausmachen und mit einem enormen aufwand produziert werden

1703584 im happy to be here at blackburn it will be an amazing adventure for me
1703585 im very happy to sign for fulham im coming here to be successful
1703586 ive already spent three weeks with the team and we have a very good squad for the new season
1703587 i know the club had a very hard season last year but im confident that this season it will be much much better
1703588 ive known mark for a long time and played against him in the past i know hes the number one but im here to give my best so that in the end the team is successful thats my mentality
1703589 if i sign a contract with a club i want to be successful i want to do everything possible to help fulham have a good season thats my number one aim

1703591 in a normal position when al ain fc plays against ac milan they will probably lose but i think on the race weekends we have a chance to beat them and im quite sure we can do it in some races
1703592 you know that the cars are all equal there is no difference everybody has the same gearbox same engine same tyres it is really hard work to go quicker than somebody else in this type of cars so i think it will be a really spectacular series
1703593 the practice went well last week the car felt good we had some minor problems but afterwards we got in some decent running the sound is amazing the fans will love it
1703594 the first time i saw the car it looked huge but now ive driven it it is really nice to drive
1703595 it feels quite similar to gp2 or world series but i think the car is very quick and quite secure at the moment

1703600 firstly i was so pleased for heikki he deserved this victory and it was great to celebrate with him and the rest of the team afterwards for me it was an unusual race i didnt expect felipe to be so strong particularly in the first stint and i was pushing the whole way to keep up with him the car wasnt at its best in the opening laps but after the first stop i was able to stabilise the gap and start clawing it back bit by bit until i had the tyre problem
1703601 it was a sudden puncture it must have occurred at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two so i had to travel a long way back to the pits at reduced speed after that i needed to look after the super soft tyre because i had a longer than expected final stint to the flag but the car felt good and i just kept pushing until the finish and picked up a useful handful of points after a day like that youve got to look at the big picture and given the problem we had with the tyre and the difficulty looking after the car in the final stint i cant really complain about finishing fifth salvaging the maximum possible points from a difficult race is always important with the championship as tight as it is you cant afford to drop too many points so i cant be too disappointed to have come away from a difficult race like that having extended my lead in the world championship
1703602 ive had a busy few months ive worked hard both on and off the track and while ive enjoyed it done some brilliant things and been to some amazing places im looking forward to having some time to myself for the next few weeks i dont have any work commitments so i can literally be on my own and spend time with my family and friends ill be using the time up any way i want to but itll basically be a mixture of total relaxation and in the second half of the break intense training i love training and i find it a good way of relaxing
1703603 proper recovery is very important for the first few days after hungary im just going to rest and recover get as much sleep as possible and then start focusing on a certain area of my body that perhaps needs more attention than others ill continue to work on my cardio fitness too do some running and cycling the constant travelling and racing does take its toll on your body and my aim is to make sure i start the second half of the season feeling as fit as when i started the year in melbourne
1703604 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team it showed us in no uncertain terms that we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia you can never under estimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident that we wont be taking anything for granted i know that everybody in woking stuttgart and brixworth will be working flat out to make sure we can be strong in all the remaining races
1703605 ive had a look at some onboard footage of the track and will be working with the team over the break to prepare for the event from the footage the track looks amazing i love street circuits but this circuit looks extremely fast and unforgiving in some places as a driver its always fun to come to a new circuit i really enjoy driving at new places and feel confident i can pick up new circuits quickly it looks like being an amazing event
1703606 we start off by creating a track model for our simulation tools using the outline plans of a circuit and checking them against satellite photos
1703607 its all about building up as detailed a profile as possible of the circuit
1703608 well run simulations to work out likely lap times and to establish the racing line we check the downforce level requirement and from there can determine braking severity cooling requirements and tyre operating conditions to make sure that our car development schedule is able to provide optimised components in time for the circuit in question
1703609 its really bumpy and its the tightest narrowest and fastest rollercoaster ride you have ever been on one small mistake at monaco means you go in the wall which means a lot of damage to the car consequently theres a lot of pressure on you i crashed in 2007 but it didnt change my approach
1703610 its very exciting racing on a street circuit theres no margin for error you can also hear the sound of the cars much more its like driving in a box also street circuits are almost always bumpy so keeping your hands steady at high speed is a challenge
1703611 we look for similarities with other circuits to help give us a generic set up with street circuits however bumps and camber changes affect the car set up more than on regular circuits
1703612 we start conservatively but by the end of first practice well have assessed the ride height we need and the ride quality and will set up our car as low as possible because of the walls the drivers tend not to lean on the power in the corners and are less aggressive so we can set the car up softer which makes it better over the bumps too
1703613 you can expect a lot of evolution through a race meeting as rubber goes down
1703614 the biggest influence on this is if it rains as this disrupts the process valencia is expected to be hot and dry but rain is forecast in the evenings in singapore
1703615 the biggest problem for singapore will most likely be visors as we dont know if there will be glare
1703616 we also fear a wet race as were concerned about how much reflection the drivers will be faced with another concern is where standing water might lie
1703617 we always walk the circuit as soon as we arrive
1703618 because theres always a new kerb or new patch of asphalt in singapore well walk the circuit once in daylight and then after dark
1703619 it defines the level of margin that theyre prepared to accept as he showed at monaco lewis is prepared to leave a minuscule margin and he finds the performance as a consequence on street circuits a driver who feels grip improve through the meeting is the one who finds the right solution soonest and learns where the bumps are and how to avoid them lewis will adapt very well to valencia and singapore as he proved last year that hes quick to learn new circuits
1703620 the most important thing is to get the car balanced you can drive with your own style as long as the car is handling well getting the right balance and set up is important so that the car can maintain its contact patch and stays stable
1703621 its a really nice circuit at almost seven kilometres its long and has everything it goes up and downhill has wide sections narrow sections smooth stretches bumps kerbs fast sections and a few hairpins its a big challenge but im not sure that you could race formula 1 cars there because its too narrow it was a real eye opener when i went there for the first time but my visits helped me appreciate street circuits
1703622 if it were real someone would have picked it up already
1703623 but its easy first we assume we have a tin opener
1703624 all the work of the fire crews came to a cease because of safety reasons
1703625 when they retreated it allowed the fire to consume a bigger area
1703626 you see mile after mile after mile of dead and dying trees trying to do wildfire mitigation has tapped all the local and county resources we have done what we can at the state level but they frankly dont have many more dollars to pull from
1703627 at the end of the day thats a drop in the bucket compared to what a catastrophic wildfire stretching across those counties would mean why cant we do a proactive emergency declaration and really leverage the dollars we need at the federal level
1703628 galveston is open for business and we certainly welcome the tourists back to the island
1703629 texas is grateful that this storm did not escalate to hurricane strength before making landfall on our shores
1703630 youll see some green up ideally if you get enough rain you can sustain a good bit of growth and maybe get some hay out of it
1703631 overall its just one of those years everybodys just hanging on living from one rain to the next

1703654 ill be riding the flame i havent seen his trials but ive heard he goes all right
1703655 you always know that gai will have the horse ready to go so im looking forward to it
1703656 hes a very exciting horse and one im sure youll be hearing a lot of over the spring
1703657 well done kerrin nice second i backed her to win and she should have
1703658 its just a matter of readjusting to racing here its obviously different racing and it will take a few weeks
1703659 but weve got some very nice horses and im looking forward to having a big season
1703660 after doing some research on the 14th cavalry i found that the 14th cavalry group as it was designated during wwii used this piece of equipment in the european theater of operations
1703661 the first vehicle after the horse cavalry ended was a six wheeled all terrain type close to our eight wheeled stryker that the 14th cavalry received after being re activated at fort lewis wash back in 2000
1703662 when we presented it to maj highfill his expression showed how valuable this vehicle was to him it was incredible to see
1703663 first we used the wagon and currently we use the stryker the greyhound is the missing time piece that fills a gap in history

1703677 she was stranded in sydney for four or five months and when we finally got permission to bring her back home she got colic
1703678 the colic was so serious she had to have surgery and she almost died
1703679 she had her latest trial yesterday when she ran fourth over 900 metres but she was off the track all the way
1703680 shes getting there but shes a different horse now to her two year old days she was only a small thing then but now shes about six foot wide
1703681 shes going to take a while to come right this time in but shes strengthened up a lot already we havent got any plans for her yet and were just hoping she comes back
1703682 it was a nice trial but he has a lot of improvement in him
1703683 first up i expect him to run well but i wouldnt say he would necessarily win it although he is a pretty handy horse
1703684 with a long preparation ahead of him he is still carrying a bit of condition and you would think that whatever he does he would improve on
1703685 if dudes so concerned about no impact living and disposable culture why is he trying to write a book that hundreds will buy and in the process
1703686 my target is 100 and to try and equal the record or break it
1703687 i think i have got the ammo to train close to 100 winners which we did the year before
1703688 i think i have got probably as good a depth as i did back then and that was a record year a brilliant year
1703689 last year it didnt quite fall our way but things are looking good at this stage
1703690 i have been going back for the early part of every week just building the horses up slowly and im really happy with them
1703691 their form says they are my best three and the ratings say that as well
1703692 ive only been training for a little over two years but i knew brett and peter quite well when i lived in charleville
1703693 i owned a station running cattle and sheep for a number of years in blackall and i bred a couple of racehorses from there but didnt do any good with them
1703694 i trained my first winner with my first starter but after that i couldnt get her away from the tail of the field

1703735 en dan komt er nu nog een viaduct bij dat begrijpen we hier niet de meeste bewoners zijn eigenaar van hun huis ze hebben het tegen een relatief zachte prijs kunnen kopen ze hebben erin ge nvesteerd infrabel wil het wel kopen maar tegen welke prijs we worden niet onteigend zullen we met het geld dat we voor ons huis krijgen nog iets anders vinden
1703736 hebben we genoeg tijd om een nieuw huis te vinden
1703737 en voor welke prijs en waar richting brussel is het duur in de andere richting ligt vlaanderen en daar kunnen we alleen in het nederlands terecht
1703738 de mensen stonden buiten aan te schuiven het was de tijd dat hier heel wat fabrieken stonden bij de usines peeters lacroix werkte 1 200 man neen ik kom er niet meer in dat caf veel te francofoon let op wij spreken frans hoor maar thuis spreken we vloms
1703739 ziet ge die bovenleiding van die treinsporen op de talud daar daar boven komt de viaduc
1703740 ik ben mijn hele leven te voet naar het werk gegaan eerst bij tubes de haren later bij de opvolger neen bij de peeters lacroix heb ik niet gewerkt die betaalden niet genoeg ik heb nog geweten dat er sporen liepen door de verdunstraat van de fabrieken
1703741 ze zijn van die plannen afgestapt toen ze beseften dat ze aan het station van schaarbeek niet verder zouden raken
1703742 er is zelfs voor onteigend in de straat drie huizen en een fabriek brussel is eigenaar van de terreinen ik heb infrabel voorgesteld dat ze dat viaduct daar zouden neerpoten dan hoefden er niet opnieuw huizen tegen de vlakte maar dat ging niet door de bocht die de trein dan zou moeten maken
1703743 ik woon hier graag ik ben hier op mijn gemak kijk naar mijn windhaan

1703965 this is one of the saddest things happening in the world today this is not just my country but my world too for the first time i am getting a small chance to experience even a fraction of their suffering
1703966 the chinese governments claim that it has brought much development to tibet is not true i came to india in december 2003 it has not been long for me in exile i know for a fact that it is not true they are lying to the world
1703967 it is upon those in exile now to do something for our nation we owe it to those inside tibet who regardless of the dangers raise their voice against the brutal chinese regime

1703976 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1703977 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1703978 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1703979 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1703980 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1703981 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1703982 shes looking forward to the trip and im looking forward to hearing her report from the trip
1703983 we want to see freedom and prosperity restored to burma
1703984 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1703985 creating a significant incentive for people to delay house purchases
1703986 there are some things you learn best in calm and some in storm
1703987 youth is a gift of nature age is a work of art
1703988 miracles sometimes occur but one has to work terribly hard for them
1703989 if i could wish for my life to be perfect it would be tempting but i would have to decline for life would no longer teach me anything
1703990 you must have long term goals to keep you from being frustrated by short term failures
1703991 if you are patient in one moment of anger you will escape a hundred days of sorrow
1703992 if i had thought about it i wouldnt have done the experiment the literature was full of examples that said you cant do this
1703993 you are not here merely to make a living you are here in order to enable the world to live more amply with greater vision with a finer spirit of hope and achievement you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand
1703994 if youre falling off a cliff you may as well try to fly you have nothing to lose
1703995 take a music bath once or twice a week for a few seasons and you will find that it is to the soul what the water bath is to the body
1703996 the u s constitution doesnt guarantee happiness only the pursuit of it you have to catch up with it yourself
1703997 develop an attitude of gratitude and give thanks for everything that happens to you knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation
1703998 weve known for some time that the expansion of coverage with highly active arv therapy could help to reduce the number of new infections however we were amazed at the actual number of new infections that can be potentially averted by expanding access to treatment
1703999 sex without condoms may pose no realistic risk of hiv transmission from people with an undetectable viral load and no sexually transmitted infections
1704000 the strongest argument for scepticism is the experience of much of the us and europe where treatment is relatively widely available yet hiv incidence remains stubbornly high or is rising
1704001 this year more than ever these debates are going to be important
1704002 this campaign started on such a high plane and now were down to the britney spears ads and stuff like that i think it will be a good thing for the country to see these two men at the debates
1704003 it is a very important event a major event for our country im always aware of that its scorching im trying to make sure that things are fair but thats only part of it its also got to be perceived as fair its tough work but its exhilarating as well
1704004 before there was no way for the moderators to go in there with a follow up question
1704005 itll be my job to get them to ask the follow up question themselves and when they dont ill be able to
1704006 itll be a little more free wheeling well try to make it as much of a debate among the two of them rather than just asking and answering questions
1704007 on the surface this seems like gross negligence on the part of banks as they would have to assume a higher risk of default by these so called

1704037 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1704038 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1704039 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1704040 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1704041 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1704042 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1704043 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the freeze for freeze offer to launch negotiations it does not require further clarification
1704044 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations

1704054 machine room occupies a lot of real estate space that could be used for renting purposes or storage facilities
1704055 doing away with the machine rooms at the top of the building enables the architect to freely design roof space it also gives room for expansion upwards
1704056 the energy used to operate a system gets dissipated into heat and is wasted in the building instead of dissipating it into the air we take the heat and we send it back into the building power grid to be re used for lights and computer systems for example

1704069 why am i not enraged that my country has killed or hurt so many people for absolutely no noble cause in my name and with my tacit approval
1704070 but cindy it is not polite to be angry or to use such strong language in public
1704071 in consideration of our special relation to the people of mexico and out of respect for international law let me take some time to read this evenings us supreme court decision which was split 5 to 4 and take some time to think about this
1704072 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that he felt that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets
1704073 he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office
1704074 desegregation racial harmony fair wages womens rights and gay rights
1704075 speaking of free speech oreilly savage and hannity are just exercising theirs
1704076 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks
1704077 then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks
1704078 much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to islamic terrorists there was a specific intent indispensably aided by abc news to link the anthrax attacks to iraq and saddam hussein
1704079 that means that abc news four well placed and separate sources fed them information that was completely false
1704080 the same government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on iraq surely the question of who generated those false iraq anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade
1704081 it was not a carefully weighed decision but the implementation of an assumption
1704082 no indication of any weakening in the japanese determination to fight
1704083 it is necessary to study and decide on the termination of the war
1704084 that the bomb and the bomb alone ended the war and saved countless american lives remains an article of faith
1704085 history collective memory and the decision to use the bomb
1704086 truman and the a bomb targeting noncombatants using the bomb and his defending the decision
1704087 roosevelt truman and the atomic bomb 1941 1945 a reinterpretation
1704088 bombing of civilians was such an established practice that american leaders accepted it as a legitimate means of conducting war
1704089 would have elected to use the bomb even if the numbers of us casualties prevented had been relatively small
1704090 history collective memory and the decision to use the bomb
1704091 aid the economic aid must be managed from the outside the aid should focus upon projects like roads water and to a lesser degree schools and medical services nato allies especially slackers like france germany italy and spain need to increase aid to afghanistan u
1704092 our troops and our nato allies are performing heroically in afghanistan
1704093 defeating the enemy is best accomplished by hiughly trained fighters who travel light
1704094 the problem really is in neighboring pakistan where taliban and al qaeda commanders lurk

1704113 you know when he sticks it in he hears an echo
1704114 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
1704115 if ivins was indeed responsible for the attacks did he have any assistance did anyone else at the army lab or elsewhere have any knowledge of his activities prior to during or shortly after the anthrax attacks the fbi must see this investigation through to completion

1704146 death is hard but then having the agents come in here is even harder
1704147 were hoping walkers death was just a fluke accident and it was just a coincidence that within 10 hours we had two people die in explosions
1704148 but then it gives me a little pause because we had a pipe bomb explosion
1704149 if it happens that its just a coincidence then ok if it happens that its not then ok but if we hide our heads in the sand then shame on us
1704150 the agents definitely said he was either planning to build a bomb or has built a bomb
1704151 after we cleared adames residence we decided it would be beneficial to go through the walker residence to make sure we didnt miss anything
1704152 our familys having a hard time because everybody said they heard the explosion but nobody called 911
1704153 i dont know if a battery would blow that big or not

1704157 we need to at least find out one way or another
1704158 was it an accident or did somebody have malicious intent

1704191 for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns
1704192 the full name was greenwich village west a community of artists
1704193 i thought it was a little corny myself but they really were trying to make it a hip place other similar places downtown were filled with junkies and losers of all sorts and it looked like they made a pretty good effort to keep that element out of greenwich village west
1704194 is gov blagojevich talking to you now are you talking to him
1704195 we have maybe once every two or three months hell call about something and im there to take the calls but we have not had a close relationship
1704196 one of the concerns is whether the governor is looking for a capital plan as a way of rewarding his friends
1704197 whether signing the ethics bill is enough to solve the problem of trust i dont know but its a good first step
1704198 increasing school funding improving the school funding structure and eliminating any current inequities
1704199 strike down the way we currently fund schools and start all over again
1704200 i am delighted we have received an offer which i believe will be acceptable to our members
1704201 common calls in portsmouth are to deal with ants or being a coastal city dead seagulls or pigeons in the grounds the number of calls logged reflects the proactive approach adopted by the trust as successful pest control relies on early identification of potential problems
1704202 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts
1704203 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1704204 i think its stupid because maybe they could have done something more at that time and maybe now its too late to find any clue so i think its very neglectful by the police
1704205 and maybe not even the dutch police but more the british or portuguese police because at that time i remember the police told me they were suspecting the parents themselves i thought it was crazy to think that but thats maybe why they didnt do something with it
1704206 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1704207 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1704208 if anyone wants to know my opinion he only has to click for it
1704209 i was contacted by a representative of china boat trade association in response to the announcement of the formation of the san diego superyacht association after discussing san diegos attributes and attraction to megayachts the group added san diego to their u s itinerary
1704210 i dont anticipate a formal agreement or collaboration in the immediate future
1704211 in the coming years there are synergies that will certainly develop
1704212 we were honored to welcome our chinese counterparts to san diego
1704213 this is the first step toward creating an on going exchange of business ideas and projects between our two cities
1704214 at least they waited for the ref to start the game before giving up two quick goals
1704215 the first and last dam on the kickapoo run of river at gays mills
1704216 this mets club that they have right now the fans are very very passionate about
1704217 that club is very good they will be heard from before it is all said and done
1704218 spew a little anger at the opposition to try and take them out of the game
1704219 ask your english teacher when you start school next week
1704220 everyone in or on the plane was watching the movie
1704221 if you look at what has happened in the past each time there is a major event such as the world cup or a catastrophe like the tsunami in se asia criminals have seized the opportunity to deploy scams
1704222 the targets are end users but they are using the corporate networks
1704223 when people enter keywords related to olympics related content they could be directed to websites set up by criminals
1704224 technical problems in our control room and work was undertaken to resolve this issue
1704225 typically this happens because there is not enough control over the process of acquiring software
1704226 some virtual machines are only licensable when they are switched on and you need to use tools to record when they are switched on and when they are switched off one of the exciting things is that hundreds of virtual machines can be created in minutes but you will need another layer of administration to ensure only certain people can create them
1704227 one of the problems is that with such disjointed systems keeping everything in one place is no easy task
1704228 we did try using microsoft sms now called configuration manager and that discovered all our assets without a problem but it became extremely labour intensive for us to administer we had too much information and were spending hours trying to decipher all this data
1704229 to make matters worse there are only a small number of vendors who can give you accurate information about what you own
1704230 if you eliminate software you do not need you can save millions
1704231 one customer was paying 22 000 a month for three commonly used desktop packages but had enough copies that they didnt need to buy another licence for four years
1704232 it is important to have a process in place that begins with asking for the business case for acquiring a piece of software
1704233 the next question is whether the organisation already has the software that is needed and whether it is tested and approved the final question is whether you have a licence for it
1704234 the biggest cry is for the industry to simplify these licences
1704235 the industry could do more to make asset management easier one tactic is to seek out customers who are under licensed
1704236 we want to unravel the secrets of the microcosm and of the early universe the lhc has the highest energy ever obtained in a collider and so will bring us closer to the big bang and to the early universe
1704237 the standard model only works for massless particles and we know that with a few exceptions the fundamental particles of the universe are not massless
1704238 we know from theory and we know from our precision tests that the answer to the question of how particles gain mass must lie within the energy reach of the lhc
1704239 if we dont find it the higgs mechanism doesnt exist and theorists will have to find another theory to explain how particles acquire mass
1704240 our hope is to get a first glimpse of dark matter
1704241 there will be 40 million collisions a second but we can only afford to write a tiny fraction of them to tape
1704242 no science centre no research institution and no particle physics lab in the world has enough computer power to do all the work
1704243 ten or 20 years ago we might have been able to repeat an experiment
1704244 they were simpler cheaper and on a smaller scale today that is not the case so if we need to re evaluate the data we collect to test a new theory or adjust it to a new development we are going to have to be able reuse it that means we are going to need to save it as open data
1704245 so the reality today is that lots of researchers can no longer afford access to the papers they need
1704246 the aim is to make all hep journal articles free to read and reuse as we want and at the same time alleviate the serials crisis
1704247 inspire would be an ideal test bed to experiment with overlay journals because it will contain the entire corpus of the discipline
1704248 the classical journal article will not remain the main vehicle for scholarly communication
1704249 in the future we can expect to see different materials and media used at different stages of the research process
1704250 i am pretty confident that open access will be the standard of the future for scientific papers although it remains unclear when open data will become the norm

1704666 as a coach the greatest reward is to see your athletes happy motivated and swimming fast all of these were met at the meet the team spirit was the best it has ever been with every athlete getting on the block with their 15 other teammates firmly in their corner it was a lot of fun
1704667 at least two of our swimmers dominique massie martel and ashley mcgregor have likely qualified for the upcoming junior pan pacific championships

1704695 if the people of jammu want a separate state based on hindu majority in the two and half districts of the region then so be it

1704704 common calls in portsmouth are to deal with ants or being a coastal city dead seagulls or pigeons in the grounds the number of calls logged reflects the proactive approach adopted by the trust as successful pest control relies on early identification of potential problems
1704705 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts

1704714 from what tony mowbray has said to me hes going to make the decision before the arsenal game
1704715 in this large population based study we found that diabetes developed within 9 years after the index pregnancy in 18 9 of women with previous gestational diabetes this rate was much higher than the rate among women without gestational diabetes 2
1704716 may reflect the large numbers of south and east asian and black populations living in urban areas who have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes
1704717 the main strength of our study lies in the fact that it was a large population based study involving more than 21 000 women with gestational diabetes with up to 9 years of follow up
1704718 unlike other studies it covered a large well defined geographic region with a population of 13 million which allowed us to make a more robust assessment of the risk of type 2 diabetes after gestational diabetes than has been possible in previous studies
1704719 assess the effect of ethnicity obesity and level of fasting glucose during pregnancy risk factors that are clearly associated with the development of diabetes
1704720 these women may benefit from both preventative interventions and regular screening
1704721 type 2 diabetes in pregnancy particularly if previously undiagnosed is associated with poor outcomes including an increased incidence of fetal loss malformation and perinatal death
1704722 fruit drinks were consumed more frequently than soft drinks in our study and the proportion of total energy intake from fruit drinks in the u s population doubled from 1977 to 2001
1704723 the public should be made aware that these drinks are not a healthy alternative to soft drinks with regard to risk of type 2 diabetes
1704724 the continued association of diabetes with a number of birth defects highlights the importance of increasing the number of women who receive the best possible preconception care especially for those women diagnosed with diabetes
1704725 early and effective management of diabetes for pregnant women is critical in helping to not only prevent birth defects but also to reduce the risk for other health complications for them and their children
1704726 because herbs and spices have a very low calorie content and are relatively inexpensive theyre a great way to get a lot of antioxidant and anti inflammatory power into your diet
1704727 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content
1704728 culinary herbs and spices are all generally recognized as safe and have been time tested in the diet
1704729 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits
1704730 when you add herbs and spices to food you definitely provide yourself with additional benefits besides taste
1704731 you have to let it grow germinate a little bit
1704732 some of the active ingredients generated as a result of the germination process are beneficial to you
1704733 the advantage of knowing this key ingredient and its structure is we can now make a ton of it you dont have to rely on rice to produce it or eating rice to get this beneficial effect
1704734 part of the way we know this growth factor works is by increasing levels of good enzymes that are decreased in diabetes
1704735 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
1704736 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
1704737 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
1704738 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
1704739 that has now come down to 81 9c which is a reduction of 15 4c
1704740 to cut to the chase in sydney on tuesday the average price for that same period had fallen by 15c to an average of 144 4c
1704741 for motorists it is very confusing and if they are still seeing prices up around 162c they are upset the prices arent coming down
1704742 it is extremely difficult and that is the benefit of fuelwatch
1704743 there was a 27c per litre range in sydney yesterday some petrol retailers may not to pass on the reductions in wholesale prices as quickly as others
1704744 those particular retailers are outed using the fuelwatch system at the moment they keep prices higher until someone is cheaper
1704745 we will probably see prices down below 1 30 soon and over this coming week well see the national average price down to 1 25
1704746 it is starting to work its way down theres should be another 5c to 10c of savings coming for motorists to enjoy
1704747 we have a watchdog that has some bark but no bite
1704748 we hope his replacement is going to be aggressive and pursue oil companies to look after motorists interests
1704749 i filled up on saturday in parramatta and it was 1 36 compared with anything ive seen around it was cheap as chips i travel everywhere and it is much cheaper to fill up further away from the city in campbelltown and places like that it is much cheaper
1704750 it basically doesnt allow meaningful comparison and certainly wont push down the price of groceries
1704751 the website doesnt pretend to be the end point or most comprehensive website
1704752 it can refer you to supermarkets that dont exist in your town
1704753 telling people what the price of groceries are for one day in the month for 500 out of approximately 30 000 products is like having the nations weather report based on what the weather was for one day in the month
1704754 it was a bit cowardly i would have at least thought he would have had the courage to come up and look us in the eye
1704755 we accepted him and he came to our family gatherings
1704756 the guys f ed over the admin committee f ed over the party how do you think its going to go
1704757 the fourth and amazingly the most meat headed adventure yet of the killing machine john rambo can safely be recommended to people who hate intelligence and love exploding body parts
1704758 the orgy of violence as ghastly as in any video game should go a long way toward erasing whatever goodwill stallone earned with his sentimental rocky balboa
1704759 why why after i killed your son did you do all this to save me
1704760 very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
1704761 for if when we were gods enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life
1704762 he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again
1704763 pray also for me that the message may be given to me when i open my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel
1704764 unless someone guides me so he invited phillip to come up and sit with him
1704765 therefore pray the lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest
1704766 my prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one
1704767 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
1704768 so i say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature
1704769 let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up
1704770 but in your hearts set apart christ as lord always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have but do this with gentleness and respect
1704771 what is the most important thing that has ever happened to you
1704772 what is the most important thing god has done for you
1704773 he saved me out of a car wreck or when i was sick he helped me to get well or god helped me thru my personal problems
1704774 i will talk about anything you want to talk about except religion i do not want to talk about my beliefs they are private to me ill talk about anything else
1704775 tell me what is the most important thing that has ever happened to you
1704776 what is the most important thing that has ever happened to you
1704777 well that is certainly one of the most important things that has happened to me it really changes your life
1704778 what made having kids the most important thing that has ever happened to you
1704779 the doctor told me that i should get my affairs in order
1704780 what thoughts went through your mind when you heard that
1704781 making preparations for those you leave behind is very important but thats not all the preparation
1704782 you will need to prepare yourself as well do you know what to do
1704783 mr jacobs if you would like i can share with you some very important information about preparing yourself for leaving this earth and moving on into eternity if youd like its up to you and you can do with it what you want no pressure
1704784 this peoples heart has grown callous their ears are hard of hearing and they have shut their eyes
1704785 if in fact our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing regarding them the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god
1704786 if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come
1704787 what can i ask that will direct this conversation naturally into her interest or need and allow me to share the gospel with her
1704788 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights
1704789 o highest and most admirable felicity of man to whom it is granted to have whatever he chooses to be whatever he wills
1704790 i spent 15 years trying to get him to let me play
1704791 i guess its like a father whos a policeman not wanting his son to be a cop after what hes seen out on the field and he saw a lot over 20 years 20 years is a long career so he didnt want his boy to get hurt
1704792 my dad was always considered a future hall of famer while he was playing probably in the last three years of his career i would always say dad maybe one day youll get in the hall of fame and when i said that he said youll be the one to send me in so in the family weve known this for years it wasnt a surprise
1704793 the one thing they stressed to my dad and to others was the fact that the hall of fame image is not truly found in the young athletes of today in college and the nfl the image and what the hall of famers stand for the old legends they kept saying we have to keep that alive
1704794 just because you can score touchdowns or you can intercept the ball i dont think that qualifies you as an outstanding role model and my dad i think personally not just because im his son is the best role model a kid can have especially a kid that aspires to be an athlete
1704795 my dad saw some things this summer in me where he said hey you got me he told me that so i guess its safe to say that im faster than him now
1704796 yeah some 40 year old guy that recently ran a 4 4

1704801 sex workers routinely face human rights abuses including the discriminatory denial of health services arbitrary detention by police harassment and sexual and physical violence
1704802 this award recognizes the extraordinary contribution of the asia pacific network of sex workers in the struggle for sex workers rights
1704803 i am honored to accept this award on behalf of the asia pacific network of sex workers
1704804 international recognition of sex workers human rights is vital to curb the hiv pandemic governments and un agencies need to promote sustainable comprehensive hiv prevention and care initiatives for sex workers that are community led and protect their human rights
1704805 being a part of apnsw working in solidarity with tens of thousands of sex workers in the region has allowed us to challenge the way the authorities have applied this law in cambodia and to gain strength to bring this issue to international attention
1704806 the international aids conference presents a forum to focus worldwide attention on the epidemic and our global response
1704807 unfortunately too often that response has been tainted by prejudice and misinformation only by ensuring the health and human rights of sex workers will governments un agencies donors and nongovernmental groups be effective at reducing the vulnerability of sex workers to hiv infection the asia pacific networks work epitomizes this
1704808 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him

1704822 my understanding is he manny didnt want the trade he eventually wanted to stay in boston hes making a promise that hed play hard hed do this and that and that all sounds good but the fact is weve been down this road before with him
1704823 you cant take his word that yes im going to be great the rest of the year because weve seen in the past as a track record even though its a contract year that somethings going to flip him the wrong way and hes liable to say my knee hurts my hamstring hurts and all of a sudden hes on the dl for 15 days that was probably the biggest thing they had to discuss in the front office before making this deal can we trust him to be that way or is he going to be manny of the past
1704824 thats exactly what i heard edes report that boras wanted to stop the trade i think when push came to shove i dont think manny thought the red sox were going to trade him then when all of a sudden when a trade came down manny decided whos kind of a creature of habit i dont want to go anywhere im gonna stay here and ill be a good boy well it was too late by that point

1704855 the uncertainty can only undermine the market further reducing the volume of transactions when they are already at historic lows
1704856 indeed we now have the worst of both worlds a potential delay in property transactions but with no definite proposal on the table
1704857 end this damaging speculation so that people can make informed decisions about whether to try to buy or sell their property
1704858 this would lift nine out of ten first time buyers out of stamp duty altogether and provide badly needed assistance to a group who are finding it increasingly difficult to enter the market

1704879 could it be possible that such measures would last longer or even be permanent
1704880 not only do foreign athletes need fresher air we need that too
1704881 most of these measures are long term ones and will remain after the games not all the temporary measures will be retained after the games but they may provide clues for our future work
1704882 beijing has made a lot of effort but these are temporary measures

1704904 in merging general maritime and arlington tankers we have entered into a significant value creating transaction for the shareholders of both companies we believe the new companys large diverse double hull fleet combined with its balanced chartering strategy will offer shareholders stable cash flows as well as upside potential to the products and crude tanker markets the combined company will further differentiate itself by having a sizeable fixed dividend target while retaining capital for growth this approach together with a strong financial position bodes well for management to draw upon its considerable consolidation experience to capitalize on growth opportunities that meet strict return requirements we believe our focus on growth as well as the anticipated cash cost savings of the transaction will position the combined company to increase earnings and pay substantial dividends to shareholders over the long term
1704905 general maritime is the ideal partner to increase value for arlington tankers shareholders
1704906 the combination of general maritime and arlington tankers provides significant opportunities for long term growth in shareholder value as a result of the larger and more diverse fleet stronger financial position and highly experienced team to actively manage and further expand the fleet complementing the combined companys focus on fleet and earnings growth i am pleased that our shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to receive attractive dividends supported by a balanced chartering strategy and a sizeable revenue stream
1704907 in leading the combined company we intend to be steadfast in our pursuit of creating value for shareholders over the long term in seeking to accomplish this critical objective we will draw upon managements past success which includes returning over 1 billion to shareholders and achieving total returns of 180 since going public in 2001 we are excited about the prospects of the combined company and will actively seek opportunities to grow the combined companys strong portfolio of assets while maintaining a stable dividend return to our enlarged shareholder base

1704977 un xito de la agencia magnun fue la de guardar los derechos de los fot grafos no manipular el contexto de la fotograf a no cortar la fotograf a mostrar el nombre de la fotograf a y quien la tom

1704979 el pcv al momento de hacer consideraciones sobre las candidaturas vio necesaria la consolidaci n de una verdadera unidad estrat gica para derrotar a la oligarqu a y al imperialismo
1704980 el gobierno que se va implantar a partir del pr ximo 23 de noviembre en este estado pretende recuperar el poder de las manos de la oligarqu a todo ello para transferirle ese poder al pueblo la gobernaci n no es un sitio donde est un gobernador m s bien ste debe ser un coordinador de las organizaciones populares y de toda la comunidad ese tiene que ser nuestro trabajo y junto con el pcv y el resto de la alianza vamos a lograrlo
1704981 nosotros pedimos que se adelante una investigaci n para ver de d nde provienen los inmensos recursos que maneja el candidato aldala makled o m s bien de su hermano walid makled quien es el que realmente est detr s de todo esto
1704982 el pasado s bado tuvimos la oportunidad de ir al encuentro de la carta de las am ricas y vimos c mo iban cinco camionetas y un cami n repartiendo mercanc a utilizando la pobreza para su campa a pero lo m s grave es que est n utilizando mercanc a de mercal para hacer campa a pol tica y en eso est detr s el gobernador de carabobo
1704983 por all andan diciendo que cuando lleguemos a la gobernaci n vamos a botar a la gente quiero decir que eso es falso nosotros estamos es sumando gente no desechando pero por supuesto la gente que est dispuesta a trabajar para la revoluci n se queda y no gente que trabaje para la derecha
1704984 si el ppt quiere darle su apoyo a varias candidaturas a las alcald as de carabobo bienvenidos ser n recuerden que estamos siempre abiertos al di logo en funci n del beneficio de las mayor as es decir todos los partidos tienen que dejar atr s ese arrastre que tra amos de la cuarta rep blica de tomar las decisiones desde las c pulas y no desde las bases

1704988 i feel the olympics will help china develop because china used to be so closed and it gives an opportunity for the whole world to see china
1704989 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1704990 china is strong now i came here because i think the olympics is everyones responsibility
1704991 we are making it clear to china that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
1704992 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1704993 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1705009 the christians of east beirut have been waiting for this moment for a long time they see the israeli invasion of lebanon as the solution to all their problems the chance for them to reassert their authority and influence over their country
1705010 umar taught the richly caparisoned of christian commanders and bishops a lesson in humility by accepting their surrender in a patched and ragged robe and seated on a donkey
1705011 no reliable figures are available of the total number of muslims who perished but according to ibn al athir some seventy thousand were slaughtered in al aqsa alone all of them non combatants and some of them imams and professors of theology who had taken refuge in a sanctuary christian analysts have confirmed this report and one of their chaplains called raymond exulted in print over the atrocities that were perpetrated wonderful sights rewarded our eyes he wrote some of our men and they the more merciful cut off the heads of the enemies others shot them with arrows so that they fall from the towers others tortured them 1onger by casting them into the flames heaps of heads and hands and feet were to be seen in the streets of the city
1705012 strict orders were issued to all muslim troops to protect christian life and property and not a single christian was molested on account of his religion a remarkable contrast to the atrocities perpetrated by the franks eighty years before
1705013 lo you are those who love them though they love you not
1705014 he asked what territory we wanted to have whether as far north as beirut or even beyond that i said we will ask for what we need more immigrants the more land
1705015 the achilles heel of the arab coalition is the lebanon muslim supremacy in this country is artificial and can be easily overthrown a christian state ought to be set up there with its southern frontier on the river litani we would sign a treaty of alliance with the state thus when we have broken the strength of the arab legion and bombed amman we could wipe out trans jordan after that syria could fall and if egypt still dared to make war on us we would bomb port said alexandria and cairo we should thus end the war and would have paid to egypt assyria and chaldea on behalf of our ancestors
1705016 our fathers had reached the frontiers which were recognized in partition plan
1705017 they will extend beyond jordan perhaps to lebanon and perhaps to central syria as well
1705018 the united nations general assembly must immediately establish an international criminal tribunal for israel icti as a subsidiary organ under u
1705019 the purpose of the icti would be to investigate and prosecute israeli war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide against the peoples of lebanon and palestine just as the icty did for the victims of international crimes committed by serbia and the milosevic regime throughout the balkans
1705020 the establishment of icti would provide some small degree of justice to the victims of israeli war crimes crimes against humanity and genocide against the peoples of lebanon and palestine just as the icty has done in the balkans
1705021 without such a deterrent israel might be emboldened to attack syria with the full support of the likhudnik bush jr neoconservatives who have always viewed syria as low hanging fruit ready to be taken out by means of their joint aggression
1705022 the israeli press has just reported that the bush jr administration is encouraging israel to attack syria if israel attacks syria as it did when it invaded lebanon in 1982 iran has vowed to come to syrias defense
1705023 and of course israel and the bush jr administration very much want a pretext to attack iran this scenario could readily degenerate into world war iii
1705024 for the u n general assembly to establish icti could stop the further development of this momentum towards a regional if not global catastrophe
1705025 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded

1705061 we understand that the department is trying to implement internal audits in various areas however the current budget and personnel situation makes this a difficult task nonetheless audits would greatly benefit the parks and significantly reduce the risk of loss or theft as well as point out areas where improvements could be made

1705075 he venido a encender la l mpara del amor en vuestros corazones para ver que ella brille d a a d a con m s esplendor he venido a hablarles sobre esta fe unitaria este principio espiritual este camino de amor este deber de amor esta obligaci n de amar
1705076 la existencia aqu es dura pero estamos acostumbrados es parte de nuestra cultura a mi no me gusta estar en los campamentos de refugiados de argelia ni en las zonas ocupadas por marruecos vivir libre a pesar de las dificultades es lo mejor
1705077 desde aqu pod is observar los tanques los soldados y a veces sus aeronaves es una amenaza constante pero esta es mi tierra y de aqu no me van a echar
1705078 los restos del lucrativo negocio de las armas se encuentran por todas partes y lamentablemente muchos de los pa ses con responsabilidades hist ricas que pretenden mostrarse como mediadores neutrales se ven directamente involucrados en el desproporcionado rearme del ej rcito ocupante
1705079 al pueblo saharaui no lo ha organizado ni las agencias de ayuda humanitaria de las naciones unidas ni ning n gobierno u ong fueron ellos mismos quienes mostraron una incre ble capacidad para crear estructuras en medio de la nada las mujeres mostraron una fortaleza y determinaci n decisiva que perdura hasta nuestros d as
1705080 se trata de una medida temporal pues para ellos es importante recordar que todo esto se realiz siempre con la idea de regresar a su tierra
1705081 es que la gente solo visualiza los campamentos de refugiados de tindouf y no sabe que ya existe un territorio liberado adem s del ocupado
1705082 el sahara occidental tiene cientos de kil metros de playas y mar ciudades y minas muy ricas no es un p ramo como a veces se da a entender
1705083 la gente en los territorios ocupados lo pasa muy mal los activistas pro derechos humanos son torturados desaparecidos y encarcelados si hubiese una orden pol tica de acudir en su auxilio la acatar a ahora mismo
1705084 aparentemente la milicia del polisario cuenta con un material militar que dif cilmente podr a contrarrestar la capacidad ofensiva de la dictadura marroqu pero esto mismo se pens en los setenta y la sorpresa fue que aguantamos y golpeamos durante mas de quince a os hasta el d a de hoy la voluntad de un pueblo es su mejor arma
1705085 aqu lo que hay es un claro intercambio entre espa a y marruecos si marruecos contiene la emigraci n ilegal espa a se calla sobre el sahara si espa a les vende tanques marruecos les deja el banco pesquero saharaui y as con la droga el terrorismo isl mico etc que me perdonen pero es la verdad
1705086 pero para nosotros lo mas doloroso es lo del psoe desde que felipe gonz lez vino aqu en los setenta hablando sobre nuestro derecho a la autodeterminaci n hasta la actualidad con moratinos hemos recibido una pu alada por la espalda tras otra al menos con en el pp sabemos que no tenemos nada
1705087 la mejor a y la buena vecindad que el pp nunca tuvo con marruecos
1705088 no significan mas que la venta de carros blindados m 60 el apoyo diplom tico a la dictadura mon rquica y la explotaci n ilegitima de su banco pesquero por parte de la flota espa ola
1705089 es como poner tiritas a un herido que se est desangrando
1705090 aqu cada observador de la onu tiene un veh culo nuevo un sueldo de ocho mil euros al mes los mejores hoteles helic pteros y todo para que qu observan cu ndo nos ayudan somos arrestados y torturados de manera sistem tica y ellos no hacen mas que mirar para otro lado
1705091 la represi n ha aprendido de nuevas formas de tortura menos obvias pero igual de terror ficas como son la ba era la bolsa y el pollo
1705092 los traen en camiones y autobuses desde las zonas mas deprimidas del reino llegan exhaustos y los dejan tirados a su suerte en la costa aunque ellos no sufren la violencia sistem tica que nosotros soportamos tambi n ellos son maltratados por el r gimen absolutista nuestra lucha no es contra el pueblo marroqu sino contra el rey mohamed vi y sus militares corruptos
1705093 lo est n empezando a hacer con los activistas mas valientes que como suele suceder muy a menudo son los mas j venes los violan y despu s los dejan abandonados en el desierto eso para la dignidad del saharaui es algo muy duro
1705094 eso es un infierno al que la onu no presta ninguna atenci n all se cometen cientos de abusos de los derechos humanos adem s de desapariciones forzadas hay mucha gente que ha sido arrestada y no se le ha vuelto a ver
1705095 quieren perder tiempo y asimilarnos que nos disolvamos en marruecos al igual que en otros conflictos el tiempo siempre juega a favor del ocupante aqu por ejemplo ya hay una especie de junta de saharauis pro marroqu es que viven muy bien es triste reconocerlo pero empiezan a ser muchos los que no han aguantado y se han vendido
1705096 incluso en el caso de que acept semos la falsa autonom a impuesta por rabat no vivir amos en un estado de derecho pues el marco de una monarqu a absolutista no es garante de nada aqu es hasta ilegal cuestionar de manera pacifica la integridad territorial qu futuro nos espera en un pa s as
1705097 marruecos no quiere un refer ndum de ninguna forma nosotros hemos aceptado incluso que todos los marroqu es que vinieron aqu antes de 1999 puedan votar pero ni a n as quieren permitirnos autodeterminarnos
1705098 las madres las estudiantes y las hijas nos organizamos junto con nuestros compa eros en la mas absoluta clandestinidad
1705099 y por supuesto tambi n sufrimos las palizas o los golpes de la polic a en nuestras manifestaciones no se vaya a pensar que por ser mujeres nos pegan menos
1705100 grabamos nuestras acciones y las colgamos en internet tenemos la esperanza de que la gente nos vea resistir y se sume a nuestras reivindicaciones democr ticas all en europa les importa mucho la democracia verdad

1705177 the molecular interaction in oxygen revealed by this study is due to the unique fact that oxygens outmost orbital is half filled with two unpaired electrons
1705178 as the molecules are squeezed into smaller volumes at high pressure electrons in the orbital inevitably move about trying to pair with electrons in the neighboring molecules
1705179 the behavior of oxygen at high pressure demonstrates one of the most profound effects of pressure on matter which transforms the colorless air we breath into colorful dense solids
1705180 the drastic change in the appearance of this familiar gas is due to the bonding changes in oxygen induced by high pressure
1705181 this is the first demonstration of how new tools can be used to probe the subtle interactions between atoms and molecules that lead to the formation of entirely new crystal structures
1705182 these new structures may give rise to entirely new electronic magnetic and other physical properties that could lead to new technologies
1705183 it is exciting to find that oxygen forms molecular clusters under high pressure through similar mechanism and this opens a possibility for new forms of materials at high pressure with potential for technical applications
1705184 although hamdans trial will be seen as a landmark case in the tribunals because it is the first in six years

1705205 this year we saw all the same companies return to exhibit at maats and more the slight attendance decrease can be attributed to the fact that returning companies brought less people to the show
1705206 in fact we had a larger number of buyers attend this years show than last year the 400 total buyers doesnt take into account the buyer cross over we saw from icast which doesnt record those numbers
1705207 the feedback we received from maats exhibitors regarding the shared show floor was overwhelmingly positive
1705208 exhibitors and buyers alike felt the shared space created an increased buzz for both shows and provided each venues participants with new business opportunities
1705209 this large dealer turnout signals great potential for the shows future

1705242 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1705243 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1705244 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1705245 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1705246 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee
1705247 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1705248 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1705249 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations

1705260 the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
1705261 the prevalence of allergic disease is increasing in the modern world and severe respiratory viral infections early in life impart a greatly increased risk for asthma and allergic disease
1705262 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism
1705263 the ease of implementation means that this discovery will have legs i have great faith in my chemistry materials science and engineering colleagues in the community to drive this discovery hard and hopefully their work along with our continued studies will yield viable technologies within 10 years
1705264 our innovation is applicable to edge emitting as well as surface emitting semiconductor lasers operating at any wavelength all the way from visible to telecom ones and beyond
1705265 it is an important first step towards beam engineering of lasers with unprecedented flexibility tailored for specific applications in the future we envision being able to achieve total control of the spatial emission pattern of semiconductor lasers such as a fully collimated beam small divergence beams in multiple directions and beams that can be steered over a wide angle
1705266 such an advance could also lead to a wide range of applications at the shorter wavelengths used for optical communications a very narrow angular spread of the laser beam can greatly reduce the complexity and cost of optical systems by eliminating the need for the lenses to couple light into optical fibers and waveguides
1705267 light is collected over a large area like a window and gathered or concentrated at the edges
1705268 the mechanism of killing is non specific with reactive oxygen species causing damage to many bacterial components so resistance is unlikely to develop even from repeated use
1705269 infected wounds are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality and an increase in the duration and the cost of hospital stay the growing resistance to conventional antibiotics among organisms that infect wounds and burns makes such infections difficult to treat the technique we are exploring is driven by the need to develop novel strategies to which pathogens will not easily develop resistance
1705270 this study marries advanced imaging techniques with one of the most important topics in oncology today antiangiogenic drugs we hope that by doing this study well understand better how antiangiogenic drugs work how imaging can shed light on making decisions about therapeutic choices and how to better develop improved treatments for cancer
1705271 we are delighted that acrin has contracted with us to assist them in this important clinical initiative
1705272 participating in this trial will help advance healthcare and leveraging the computational power of ib neuro is a very cost effective way to provide the results
1705273 when comparing the results of other mr perfusion techniques against ib neuro ib neuro showed a statistically significant ability to consistently differentiate between normal and abnormal brain tissue whereas all the other techniques to which ib neuro was compared did not
1705274 this rich information should enable clinicians to better personalize care for patients with brain tumors and other brain disorders
1705275 cellular dynamics has set out to do something unique in the stem cell field make money working with the scientific know how of stem cell pioneer jamie thomson at the university of wisconsin the company is run by a group of midwestern pragmatists who believe that stem cells can blaze a new path toward more efficient drug development offering an early look at how human cells will respond to an experimental therapy and theyve actively begun marketing products in a breakthrough for the entire stem cell field
1705276 we are extremely pleased that the patent office has officially concluded these reexaminations
1705277 due to the patent offices extremely thorough and detailed reexaminations we feel our patents are stronger than ever and affirm that dr james thomsons groundbreaking discoveries are patentable inventions
1705278 human embryonic stem cells provide researchers powerful tools for testing drugs at the cellular level which may lead to astonishing advances in pharmaceutical development particularly in the field of personalized medicine and reduce reliance on animal testing they also have the potential to offer new treatments and cures for devastating diseases such as diabetes parkinsons alzheimers and spinal cord injuries that afflict millions of people around the world
1705279 but it takes millions upon millions of dollars to develop and bring new medical discoveries to market and without patents to protect their investments and the opportunity to generate profits companies will not commit resources to the lengthy and costly development and clinical trials process

1705281 i think most people in our community know what he has done for the community
1705282 it was a wonderful memory for him in a year of lots of hard work
1705283 i do have a hard time every now and then
1705284 theres no way i want him out on the streets
1705285 i dont think closure is a word these families can use
1705286 one thing about palmyra is were all family were all close
1705287 we get together for movies in the park canaltown days pirates weekends we go to the community center when something like this happens it strikes the very soul of everyone in the community
1705288 she said mom im going to get ready for bed
1705289 those are the last words she ever said to me those are precious memories
1705290 no sooner did we get in the air when we found them
1705291 it was a nightmare to come across something like that you can investigate a lot of things but its different with children it was wanton and senseless
1705292 and he was seen by several students playing tennis walking through the soccer field where the bodies were found
1705293 ill never forget it as long as i live and am a cop
1705294 ill never forget those little kids the pain they must have endured
1705295 there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever in my mind that he did it
1705296 there was no one else involved and nothing satanic going on
1705297 it took on a life of its own and i became part of a cast of characters it was a whirlwind and enveloped everyones lives
1705298 no matter what side of this case you were on
1705299 you still understood that there were two lives extinguished and it should have never ever happened it left an indelible mark on you for the rest of your life
1705300 they dont have the freedom a lot of kids have

1705304 he took away everything her prom her high school graduation her wedding day my grandchildren my best friend my daughter
1705305 she would have been a beautiful young lady and a great mom
1705306 relationships come and go but a friendship can stand the test of time do you have what it takes well if you do then i am the guy you should be writing
1705307 i am an honest loyal funny and understanding person who does not judge people for what they have done but for who they are experience is not what happens to a man experience is what a man does with what happens to him i made a bad decision as a teenager and do not have the background in the way of life that other people have though that does not diminish my drive and ambitions to succeed in life
1705308 he poses extreme danger to the community and should not be released
1705309 and i dont say this lightly but i know some day he will be
1705310 the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line
1705311 at the end of the day its about quality of coaching and quality of players and the excellence that they have do you make excuses or do you find ways to be successful as opposed to throwing water out of the back of the boat we have a plan and are paddling to a destination im proud of our coaches and players and really couldnt care less what the critics say when they call us lucky 6 0 is 6 0

1705319 it was mind boggling because it went completely against what we had expected to see happening
1705320 once we figured out what was happening however the results were very clear
1705321 in the past many believed that cell specialization or differentiation was a terminal state there was no going back or getting young again
1705322 but now not only do we know this reversion happens naturally we also have a very tractable genetic system in which to study it
1705323 i had about four different hypotheses to explain why i couldnt see any of these cells crossing the dorsal trunk
1705324 it took quite a while to convince ourselves what was truly going on
1705325 to find two very different kinds of progenitor cells in a single fruit fly tissue raises the possibility that there may be more than one kind of adult stem cell in mammalian tissue
1705326 it may be that organisms use both quiescent undifferentiated cells and more highly differentiated yet reversible facultative stem cells under different conditions
1705327 although it wasnt expected drosophila have clearly taken advantage of this biological capacity during metamorphosis
1705328 the stem cell community is debating whether every mammalian tissue relies on conventional adult stem cells of the sort already identified in bone marrow and muscle or if instead there are facultative stem cells that can arise from differentiated cells within the tissue now we know that it doesnt necessarily have to be one or the other it could be both
1705329 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world

1705337 three things can happen to light when it hits a material
1705338 it can be reflected as in a mirror it can be transmitted as with window glass or it can be absorbed and turned into heat this metamaterial has been engineered to ensure that all light is neither reflected nor transmitted but is turned completely into heat and absorbed it shows we can design a metamaterial so that at a specific frequency it can absorb all of the photons that fall onto its surface
1705339 we are concerned that non athletic girls have some of the same components of the female athlete triad as athletes and are in fact at greater risk for low bone density
1705340 these young women are under great pressure to conform to societys standards of body image in an effort to lose weight they are restricting their caloric intake and adapting unhealthy nutrition habits
1705341 most important and alarming is that 30 percent of the non athletes versus 16 percent of athletes were found to have low bone mineral density putting them at greater risk for developing osteoporosis earlier in life
1705342 change in endothelial function is the seminal event in cardiovascular disease
1705343 we not only need to educate athletes about the consequences of the triad now we must educate all students about the harmful effects of a restrictive diet in the adolescent period
1705344 for their safety and for the safety of the construction workers
1705345 it just gives you more information you can use as youre trying to make a decision

1705449 theres little commitment to the north island in health care education and jobs
1705450 we have a new forests minister but no sign of leadership we see untenable cut levels and jobs being shipped out
1705451 most loggers on the north island will be out of their jobs until possibly next year many of them only worked a few weeks this year

1705616 traditionally cities have taken a punitive approach to preserving neighborhoods as a result code enforcement would ticket the property owner and eventually the case would end up in municipal court
1705617 what weve found is when property falls into disrepair there usually are larger issues the residents are dealing with by punishing them with a ticket or court case the city is only compounding their problems the neighborhood preservation team will take a pro active approach with these residents well reach out to them determine what the problem is and then help the resident both fix the issue and more importantly put them in touch with organizations that can address whatever personal issues they may face
1705618 ofallon has been in a growth mode for most of the past 15 20 years

1705620 protecting the health and vitality of our neighborhoods is a key aspect in maintaining the safety and security of our citizens
1705621 healthy neighborhoods attract families who are dedicated to keeping their homes and neighborhoods safe and attractive that is one of the most important aspects of keeping crime rates low and our residents safe the involvement of the police department in the neighborhood preservation team shows that we are dedicated to identifying and alleviating potential issues from the beginning
1705622 we are fortunate that here in ofallon we do not have a huge problem with off site land owners who let their properties become unattractive
1705623 however in todays economic environment we need to be prepared for the possibility of foreclosures or other ownership transfers that could lead to problems the neighborhood preservation team will give us another vehicle to combat those potential problems and it will give any concerned neighbors a specific team to contact for assistance plus we are able to utilize existing city staff and equipment so we can do all of this at no additional cost to taxpayers
1705624 the neighborhood preservation team is truly a win win for our residents and the city
1705625 this team gives our residents a specific place to go if they have questions or concerns about situations in their neighborhood from the citys standpoint it will improve the communication between the various departments involved so we can respond to potential issues quickly and efficiently or maybe even prevent them before they occur

1705732 food allergic individuals need to increase the awareness of their food allergy among the people around them
1705733 this would include not only telling them that they are food allergic but also showing them how to treat them and how to recognize signs of an ongoing reaction

1705744 overall we are cautiously optimistic about the back half of the year
1705745 despite the continued challenging commodity cost inflation weve faced our business teams are executing well back half overlaps in the areas of shrink and excess cream sales should be favorable tempering our confidence for the balance of the year however is a heightened level of competitive pressure we are seeing in certain areas of our business as well as continued volatility and inflationary pressure across the cost spectrum
1705746 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm
1705747 we encourage men younger than 75 to discuss with their clinicians the potential but uncertain benefits and the possible harms of getting the psa test before they decide to be screened
1705748 i did not foresee a stroke happening to my daughter
1705749 stroke in children while still uncommon is not as rare as we used to think
1705750 improvements in diagnostic techniques have made it possible to confirm that a stroke has occurred when it was only suspected before and research has helped us better define treatment protocols
1705751 at the time i didnt think it would happen to my child
1705752 i am a single parent i didnt know what i was going to do
1705753 i never had anyone in my family have a stroke it was very alarming to me
1705754 parents need to educate themselves and know exactly what to do if a stroke happens
1705755 the sooner they react the sooner the child can get treatment to minimize the risk of permanent damage
1705756 the surprise in this paper is that p110beta has been found to be a bigger player than p110alpha in tumors that result from pten loss
1705757 now the drug companies which have been focusing on p110alpha will have to think about making p110beta inhibitors as well
1705758 we knew that when cells are stimulated with growth factor signals the activity of p110alpha but not p110beta rises rapidly and sharply in triggering excess cell growth
1705759 we speculate that 110beta may be providing a low level but steady growth stimulus and when pten is lost it becomes an important source of cell proliferation signals
1705760 we know what the inhibitor should look like because of our work on p110alpha inhibitors
1705761 older people may need less sleep or they may sleep less because of age related changes in the ability to fall asleep and remain asleep
1705762 younger people frequently do not get as much sleep as they need and there are many health and safety problems associated with too little sleep
1705763 if older people believe that they need more sleep than they can achieve even when they spend extra time in bed then they may complain of insomnia and could start taking medications needlessly
1705764 older people may need to be evaluated for a sleep disorder if they are tired during the day
1705765 we have no excuses ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1705766 we are focused on two things now one looking backward the other forward first we continue our internal investigation to make sure we have uncovered any and all violations of patient records we are working with dph and the federal authorities toward to this goal
1705767 second starting may 19 2008 we implemented a new training and certification module for the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa
1705768 we cant undo the wrongs of the past but we can and are redoubling our efforts to not only improve our training and security systems but to create a culture where this type of behavior will not take place
1705769 handgrip strength is also independently associated with poor hospital outcomes and may serve as a simple test that can readily identify weakness
1705770 previous strength studies have not definitively demonstrated an independent association with mortality it is unclear if patients in these studies ever manifested weakness because many may have died before awakening
1705771 there are many factors that could influence outcome such as age whether or not a patient is hyperglycemic and if a patient experiences multiple organ failure
1705772 not only does a handgrip strength test help us identify those patients who are at an increased risk of death it can also be used as a tool to also identify patients who are at higher risk for poor outcomes and candidates for interventions
1705773 additional research is necessary to determine the appropriate threshold of handgrip strength at which critically ill patients are at an increased risk of death early identification of these patients with possible icu acquired weakness might allow for more expeditious treatments that could reduce the morbidity and mortality of this disease
1705774 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1705775 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1705776 also all pilots who choose to retire under this program would receive 60 months credit toward their age and or length of service to maximize their retirement benefit as an illustration a pilot who is 57 years and two months old with 25 years of service could retire as if he or she was age 60 with 27 years and two months of service
1705777 the most important take home message is that clinical hypertension can be identified in children and adolescents and is associated with organ damage even at young ages therefore accurate diagnosis and early treatment is essential
1705778 there is now sufficient experience with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring abpm to recommend its use in pediatric patients to assist in diagnosing hypertension
1705779 ambulatory monitoring is likely to be most useful in children whose office blood pressure readings are up to 10 percent over the highest acceptable reading as children with very high readings more than 10 percent higher than the highest reading were more likely to have true high blood pressure
1705780 the global obesity epidemic is linked with increasing blood pressure levels in young people
1705781 in addition blood pressure levels at the higher end of the spectrum in the early years tend to track into adulthood and might lead to the development of hypertension
1705782 these guidelines help pediatric healthcare providers to understand the use of abpm in monitoring childrens blood pressure
1705783 a standard technique advocated by a national organization like the american heart association is reassuring to parents who want to be sure that their children are receiving consistent high quality care
1705784 heart failure patients experience high rates of hospital stays and poor outcomes
1705785 by utilizing this model we can more quickly identify patients at risk for in hospital mortality who might benefit from more aggressive monitoring and intervention
1705786 despite numerous advances in the treatment of chronic heart failure more work is needed to reduce the high risk of mortality for patients hospitalized for heart failure
1705787 an essential next step is to study whether applying this risk prediction score will favorably impact patient care and clinical outcomes
1705788 in contrast light to moderate leisure time activities including gardening outside chores golfing even dancing walking distance and pace of walking and moderate intensity exercise were all associated with significantly lower risk
1705789 the findings suggest that long term benefits of habitual light to moderate physical activity in older adults outweigh any potential higher risks of af associated with the acute activity or exercise
1705790 this is the first prospective study to examine light to moderate physical activity and the development of af
1705791 the focus was on older adults in whom most atrial fibrillation occurs after age 65 almost one in five people will develop af over 10 years
1705792 physical activity can also reduce the risk of heart attack and congestive heart failure
1705793 these easily achievable lifestyle habits including leisure time activities and walking should be further evaluated as potential preventive measures to reduce the incidence of af in older adults
1705794 these results provide additional strong reasons for clinicians and policymakers to focus on regular physical activity to maintain cardiovascular health in older adults
1705795 one may never do evil so that good may result from it
1705796 every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against god and humanity which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation
1705797 the calamity of a world war with the economic and social ruin and the moral excesses and dissolution that accompany it must not on any account be permitted to engulf the human race for a third time
1705798 born into the wrong country and you rained destruction upon me
1705799 the world ought to be more tolerant but some things remain intolerable
1705800 opinions contrary to human society such as manifestly undermine the foundations of society
1705801 his own people to be listed as it were as soldiers against his own government
1705802 it is ridiculous for anyone to profess himself to be a mohametan sic only in his religion but in everything else a faithful subject to a christian magistrate while at the same time he acknowledges himself bound to yield blind obedience to the mufti of constantinople who himself is entirely obedient to the ottoman emperor
1705803 those are not to be tolerated who deny the being of a god promises covenants and oaths which are the bonds of human society can have no hold upon an atheist the taking away of god though but even in thought dissolves all
1705804 rising fuel prices are causing people to look for alternatives to lengthy commutes and working from home or at locations closer to home are attractive options

1705810 everyone can make a difference in the lives of our less fortunate and impoverished communities we have come to help improve the lives of those south africans who are still living below the poverty line
1705811 we strongly believe that poverty is not inevitable we believe it is a social injustice which can be tackled
1705812 irrespective of the circumstances and challenges south africans have a strong sense of pride for their country and a passion for their communities i am doing all this because i like this country
1705813 i am happy i never thought i would receive this help god must bless you good people you must also help other poor families
1705814 i do not have enough words to thank the angel rock project
1705815 i have been inspired by those poor people who always strive to improve their lives and their country irrespective of the challenging environment they find themselves in
1705816 these people have inspired me because they seem to have a strong vision for their families so as a youth being part of this project i realised that our contribution is already making an impact
1705817 i am grateful to be part of this team which is making a difference in communities

1705835 the mandela bay development agency mbda established as the development arm of the municipality with a specific mandate to facilitate tourism and infrastructure development advertised a request for proposal rfp in april 2008
1705836 the municipality is calling for dynamic professional and multi disciplinary stadium operators to operate the new multi purpose stadium in nelson mandela bay which will be completed in march 2009
1705837 the mbda and municipality will shortly commence evaluating the bids submitted and individual briefing sessions will be held with each bidder from september 2008 onwards
1705838 it is anticipated that the final preferred bidder will be selected towards the end of 2008 and the municipality aims to sign a management contract with the preferred bidder in the first quarter of 2009
1705839 nelson mandela bay is the first host city to have made significant progress in the appointment of a stadium operator for not only the 2010 fifa world cup but also from a future legacy impact point of view
1705840 although nelson mandela bay is well geared to host a successful 2010 world cup tournament in nelson mandela bay it is also of vital importance that an operator is appointed to ensure that the stadium is a prominent contributor to the growth of the municipality

1705900 the supply of school properties for sale is minimal especially in the urban core

1706182 thank you for your interest in obtaining updates from our site
1706183 as everyone who has been to a meeting knows they are very paper intensive events
1706184 each piece of paper used in a meeting has the equivalent carbon emissions of burning a 60w light bulb for 1 hour as such a meeting of 10 people will typically have emissions of around 1 6kg of co2 equivalent to driving a typical 4x4 for 6 miles
1706185 the meetingpod is a paperless electronic meeting system which is much more energy efficient than using paper and uses a fraction of the energy used by laptops it holds all the meeting information that each attendee can view on their separate meetingpod this means that they do not have to print agendas minutes from the last meeting or any other information relevant to that meeting even separate presentations can be viewed on the built in screen making meeting room tables more efficient and easier to layout and use
1706186 venues are starting to look at their corporate social responsibility policies very closely
1706187 by not having a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint many meeting and conference venues are telling us that they are starting to lose business
1706188 certainly there are times when a c section offers women their families and healthcare providers a necessary and lifesaving birthing solution
1706189 however this alarming citywide increase underscores how c section has become a method of convenience rather than necessity even though it can present tremendous risks for an expecting mother just as alarming our citys hospitals have no strategy to reduce the rate we urge families and the medical community to remember that the highest level of medical intervention is not always required and is not necessarily the safest option for the mother and child
1706190 im really concerned that the c section rate continues to rise at so many of our citys hospitals
1706191 were making some positive strides as new yorks hospitals are finally complying with the legal requirement to release this data
1706192 the american healthcare system is increasingly dependent upon medical interventions to address what is most often a normal and safe physiological process
1706193 quite often women are not fully informed of the risks associated with commonly performed obstetrical interventions nor do they know there are options beyond hospital birth however as new york city women are becoming more aware of the state of standard maternity care in this city we have seen an incredible increase in demand for services outside of the hospital
1706194 we should be concerned about the long term risks of having so many women in the united states undergo major abdominal surgery particularly those who do so when they are young
1706195 i urge my colleagues and peers across the city to be open to innovative means of changing how maternity care is delivered in new york and to help develop solutions that work towards reducing the c section rate
1706196 innovests ratings are an indicator of a companys performance on intangible value drivers and management quality this information is used to support an investors existing financial knowledge of a company it is widely accepted among investors that extra financial information is now required to get a full understanding of a companys prospects
1706197 as one of this countrys leading educators of the next generation of hairstylists empire is perfectly positioned to support cut it out by teaching our more than 11 000 students per year about domestic violence and how to respond when clients are suffering from abuse
1706198 but we are not stopping at education we are dedicated to truly making an impact by promoting public awareness of this issue which is so often hidden from view each of our 87 schools will be raising money supporting womens shelters and helping women learn how to get the help they need
1706199 we salute empire education group and their commitment to spreading awareness to help break the cycle of domestic violence in america its a powerful statement about the organizations compassion and community service
1706200 all of us at cut it out are grateful that empire gives back has embraced our educational program in service to victims of violence cosmetology students are all in a unique and powerful position to spread the word that theres no excuse for abuse

1706211 a support group for glbt african americans their families and friends is very much needed in this community this is a large step in the right direction for pflag and i am hoping that it promotes awareness and acceptance in the african american community around the issue of homophobia
1706212 generally speaking research and outreach to lgbt persons of color is still limited
1706213 i hope that pflags establishment of this african american support group in winston salem will be the first of several more services to meet the needs of this population its my hope that the group will be a safe comforting and healing space for people to share whats been on their minds and hearts for quite some time

1706223 many people have no authority to give answers on those issues yet they do and this may harm the person seeking the advice sometimes they the advice givers themselves arent familiar with the subject we must extend the limits of halacha and those fluent in it to intimate matters too the goal is to provide an immediate response to the religious communitys problems
1706224 we would like to have the rabbis acknowledge the professional counseling and academic systems so that they can refer people to get professional help when the problem requires a more profound intervention

1706265 production continues to increase year over year and we are making steady progress in reducing our losses from operations at corner bay the 105 metre level was reached during the second quarter and some 10 000 tons of mineralized material were extracted however progress has been slower than expected because of operational and financial challenges copper production levels were down at copper rand during the second quarter largely due to lower copper grade in the ore and to breakdowns to transportation equipment from a financial perspective working capital deficiencies have also made it more difficult for the company to operate as effectively as possible the reality is that these challenges will persist until positive cash flow is generated which should occur in the fourth quarter of this year
1706266 the company continues development for extraction of a bulk sample at corner bay further we are working to improve the efficiency of the copper rand mine and to achieve positive cash flow by year end revenues for fiscal 2008 should be substantially higher than those realized in 2007 and we expect to be able to meet the commitments related to the plan of arrangement for meston resources inc in the coming months

1706313 kinsella is a modern day machiavelli the mastermind who ran war rooms for jean chretien and dalton mcguinty hes the ultimate political insider the war room has plenty of fascinating insights and is a must read for political junkies
1706314 warren kinsellas new book is a must read for anyone interested in political campaigning in canada and not just political campaigning i wish id had the chance to read the war room before i became stephen harpers campaign manager it might have saved me from many mistakes and months of painful learning on the job
1706315 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer
1706316 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids
1706317 i dont want to say hes a genius but theres valuable insights here

1706324 weve got some good young players coming through and improving all the time so i think weve got the makings of a decent side
1706325 it is just so disappointing because we have been waiting for craig and dean ashton to play together for so long they have only played together twice before
1706326 i was a bit disappointed because he has worked so hard all summer and hes been looking very sharp it just sums things up for us but it will give someone else a chance

1706354 in the absence to a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for our incentives package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1706355 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next step
1706356 important not to break the chain of the negotiations or we will face a difficult dynamic not only with iran
1706357 we cant deny to the other party the right to pose questions if there are problems
1706358 the message at the end of the telephone conference will probably be an agreement for an explanatory mission and at the same time a firm message with the threat of new sanctions
1706359 the phone talks today will be to decide on a common response there is the possibility of trying to send the matter back to the security council but there is always the problem of persuading china and russia
1706360 saludar la iniciativa del gobierno de recobrar un modelo democr tico para brindar informaci n p blica

1706369 over the past two months three independent research laboratories using pressure cycling technology have published findings indicating that pct can reduce the incubation time required for the trypsin digestion of proteins from hours to minutes and often with a concomitant improvement in the quality of the results of the digestion process we have replicated these results in our own laboratory this is a highly significant finding because we believe that the acceleration of protein digestion by pct together with the potential for an improvement in the quality of the result will offer the many researchers currently using mass spectrometry the ability to complete their experiments significantly faster and with the potential for better quality than at the present time we believe that this may lead to accelerated discoveries and quicker time for new products to get to market
1706370 mass spectrometry is one of the most powerful analytical tools available to modern day scientists with more than 200 000 mass spectrometry based instruments currently in operation
1706371 the global market for laboratory mass spectrometry ms has grown rapidly into a multibillion dollar business but it still has strong growth prospects almost across the board despite its size the ms market should see annual growth of better than 8 through 2010
1706372 the global proteomics and genomics sample preparation market will reach 2 billion in 2012 and we expect this market segment to grow at a robust 9 to 10 annual rate for the next several years
1706373 the preparation of samples by trypsin digestion prior to mass spectrometry analysis is a new market for our company this market is very large and is growing at a robust rate we have seen a significant increase in the number of inquiries about pct and in requests for demonstrations of the technology since the publication and presentation of these exciting discoveries two months ago we believe that this increased interest in pct will manifest itself in increased installations of the pct sample preparation system during the second half of 2008 as compared to the first two quarters of the year this is a very exciting time for all stakeholders of pbi

1706385 from our statistics it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before
1706386 the industrys resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months with carriers airports and passengers alike all waiting and watching for a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel
1706387 i like steve and what he brings to the team
1706388 hes had his ups and downs but i have a really good relationship with steve he seems as excited as anything and he had a bit of a bounce in his step
1706389 keep a comprehensive record of everyone who crosses our border
1706390 he is passionate about their human rights i have to take my hat off to him he has taken up the cause and wants to highlight it to the world
1706391 weve done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool
1706392 they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls
1706393 obviously im worried any parent would be but i am certain that china would not resort to torture or abuse when the eyes of the world are upon them
1706394 as far as we know foreigners gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that we will resist all attempts to politicise the olympics
1706395 we have laws regarding assembly and demonstrations and we hope that foreigners will respect the laws of china
1706396 at this critical moment we hope to shine the olympic spotlight on chinas occupation of tibet

1706415 the approval of the acquisition of the petrochemical assets of the ipiranga group and the consolidation of the outstanding minority interest of a number of important assets previously owned by petrobras allowed braskem to reinforce its leadership position in the brazilian petrochemical industry
1706416 domestic demand fueled by construction and consumer driven industries remained strong however oil and naphtha price increases in the quarter put pressure on operational margins leading braskem to promptly realign its prices and leverage its position in the domestic market despite the scheduled maintenance stoppages at the basic petrochemicals unit we delivered results above our internal expectations as well we still have teams actively working to capture additional gains related to integration synergies as well as initiatives to control costs in an ongoing effort to improve operational results

1706455 less worries over inflation as oil falls less worries over the dollar and a bit less worries over banks books its logical to see a stock rally at this point and that could last for a couple of weeks
1706456 some stocks have collapsed by as much as 60 percent and its no surprise to see investors starting to pick up some of the pieces
1706457 there is some sector rotation after seeking refuge in defensive sectors investors are coming back into the battered banking sector and cutting positions elsewhere

1706459 no seriously how many of you have seen the jumping fish
1706460 weve been a long time supporter of living lands and waters
1706461 and we use the waterways to haul the grain so we need to make sure our waterways our clean
1706462 the dee bennett road area was pretty bad in some parts the waste is waist deep
1706463 im gonna get rid of all of them and then keep putting them on
1706464 every time weve created a new ink ive had it on me
1706465 this is the most fun ive ever had on a job
1706466 its just another way for someone to make a buck
1706467 i dont worry about whether or not its going to come off someday
1706468 we use one ink here i have to be certain that its going to look good 10 20 years down the line
1706469 if i do it and it looks like hell in three years whats going to happen
1706470 if its bright goes in easy and doesnt fade im all for it
1706471 we were really focused on removability in the beginning and a lot of artists only heard about that
1706472 the aesthetic qualities of the ink are the most important thing right now

1706478 im delighted that we will have a much improved facility overall
1706479 were getting in step with what we want to have a safe positive presentation of our facility to visitors
1706480 this study will assess the needs of what we need currently and what we would need 15 years down the road
1706481 until we decide to consolidate i think were throwing money away too early
1706482 granted its 18 500 for this analysis but once we get that done then we can target whether we want to move forward on the property were looking at or if its not big enough to move in a different direction
1706483 either way the study is going to be used wherever we go its not specific to the property were currently looking at
1706484 if we dont have enough room in seven acres i dont know if we have to have a company tell us that
1706485 but i think seven acres is plenty of land to put a public works building
1706486 i dont oppose this and i think its going to be necessary but like i said i think its premature to spend 18 500 and we havent even made a decision on the property
1706487 primarily i want to continue to maintain an even keel
1706488 i want to keep public health and safety in order
1706489 this is totally irresponsible and has absolutely nothing to do with sound public policy the governor is just calling us back to springfield so he can do some grandstanding at the state fair
1706490 if he was serious about getting something passed he would sit down with individual lawmakers and talk not do something like this
1706491 calling the legislature into special session is extremely expensive the governor ought to pay for this himself not the taxpayers of illinois
1706492 i dont expect anything to be accomplished with these special sessions
1706493 it no longer has the controversial aspects of the chicago casino
1706494 i think we have to be realistic if speaker of the house mike madigan isnt going to get on board this isnt going to go anywhere
1706495 his members would have to revolt and i dont see that happening
1706496 i dont think its something we should go back to springfield and ramrod though because we want to
1706497 how are we going to pay for it if these schemes dont work

1706597 frank i dont understand this mans message was christ centered he talked a lot about christ but as i got to know him personally i discovered that he lied constantly he ridiculed and demeaned others he was always jealous of other people whom god blessed he was very sectarian and he was highly egotistical he also hurt many people even though he preached against hurting christians i dont understand it

1706639 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1706640 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1706641 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1706642 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against
1706643 i was sitting next to jerry colangelo and said you know weve waited three years to get off this plane and do this
1706644 i think were prepared and while were here we need to prepare more

1706646 weve been treated with the greatest amount of respect and friendliness we could not have been treated better i know well get the same treatment in beijing the chinese people love basketball and were excited were playing the first game against china
1706647 i try to see american players every time they come to china but this time is the most special because of the olympics
1706648 a once in a lifetime opportunity and they should experience all those things
1706649 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that

1706655 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

1706670 i know i cant call you everytime im scared but im going to history the class miss ramsel teaches and i really am scared
1706671 its quite all right you may call me whenever you need me but you shouldnt have to that angel was right you need to choose someone that is always around you that you can trust to have protect you
1706672 yeah i guess youre right and i have been thinking about it
1706673 well it looks like your seat is already taken maria but marcy is the new girl and lauries showing her around so i guess youll just have to sit somewhere else

1706688 i i dont know marcy i dont think that would be very funny
1706689 its not a joke really we both know shes involved in something illegal and she is your best friend right dont you want to straighten her out itll look as if her soul was being pulled from her afterwards you can just explain to her that you know about what shes involved in and have a talk with her
1706690 what is this with her soul when i heard her talking to miss ramsel she said something about giving up her soul too
1706691 oh you dont really think marias going to give up her soul do you its just a figment of speach i guess
1706692 through his efforts we found out the truth about our country
1706693 he argued against the system and it cost him a lot it was my civic duty
1706694 he was a very brave and strong man who was able to represent in himself the best characteristics of our country when you come to such a man not just to honour him
1706695 you also receive something from being near such a figure
1706696 with our second quarter results we remain on track to deliver on the corporations financial targets for 2008
1706697 we also continue to advance plans for additional investments in projects to strengthen reliability and ensure adequate future energy supplies
1706698 we traded in taser x26s for stingers the stinger is a better gun for nearly 1 2 the cost of taser x26
1706699 we felt that the price and features of stinger outweighed our decision to go with the taser x26 model
1706700 we want to fast track the demolishing and redevelopment of the westmoreland site as soon as possible we also believe that the bidding process will give us the highest price possible for the salvageable materials at the site

1706702 i am pleased to report that robust production performance in a record oil price environment has propelled addax petroleum to yet another quarter of record financial results activity levels on all our business fronts were high through the second quarter and on balance our operational performance was good our production levels were slightly below expectations and may remain so for the balance of the year but continue to be strong given supply constraints ongoing in the sector during the second quarter we also continued to expand addax petroleums property portfolio with four new license interest acquisitions this new business activity is closely aligned with our dynamic exploration program which had mixed results during the second quarter but remain exciting for the balance of the year i am particularly pleased and encouraged that our initiatives to commercialize our reserves in kurdistan and gas resources in nigeria are gaining momentum and can offer excellent value for our shareholders
1706703 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1706704 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1706705 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1706706 this speech puts together what the president has been saying for seven and a half years but does it in a very focused way
1706707 is one of the most important relationships that we have in the united states and the speech is being given on the eve of his trip there so he thought it was appropriate to talk about it at this point
1706708 absurd to try to sustain the claim that americas policies are principled while then effectively standing back and saying we will watch from the sidelines while the chinese do what they do
1706709 yes i know you did all this hard work but miss melissa is right potty chairs are for losers and you dont want to be a loser do you no you dont so take off those big girl panties put on these nemo diapers and start peeing on yourself now

1706723 when more kids know how to go sailing at least a few of them can be good sailors in the future probably they will be the gold medal in the olympics some years later in the meanwhile at least few of them will see this will be a hobby in their life they will buy the boats
1706724 the united states did not go to war in iraq solely because of wmd in my view i doubt it was even the principal cause yet it was the public face that was put on it
1706725 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer

1706869 those subscriptions represent a very loyal engaged high value audience for their advertisers and we think we can take what theyve created and the stage that they got to so far and apply that to some new ideas we have both horizontally and vertically the team there is fantastic combined with the team we already have thats focused on fandango and fancast and our property comcast net as well as our linear television channels e style channel and e online i think weve got a lot of interesting new businesses that we can grow taking their unique editorial their unique voice and their unique audience and bringing additional information to that audience with the kind of entertainment properties and content that we have and also take their ability to create that editorial and bring it perhaps to other demographics with some of the other content that comcast has were really excited it fits right in its a high monetization property and its another step as we try to grow into a major presence
1706870 obviously comcast is a very local company we have a couple of thousand local sales people in the markets that we serve we have relationships even online in terms of comcast net its a very customized local experience fancast which is our online property for navigating through your entertainment choices by design we know where you live because we set it up to work well with your television lineup in your town same thing with fandango the bridge between the consumer and their local movie theaters when you combine that with the local aspects of the way dailycandy already operates theres a lot of potential for putting together some interesting approaches to local for consumers
1706871 we know that media consumption habits are starting to change or have been changing for a little while weve been watching very carefully about how and where our young women readers are going to be consuming content weve been putting together plans to explore other platforms to grow our existing web business grow our mobile business both of which we currently have but were going to start to invest in as well as trying to figure out how people might want to personalize our content or bring our content with them
1706872 why not marry the fandango com and dailycandy content together on our platform or their platform or some sort of hybrid same thing with comcast net theyre providing local content and thats what we do if they can help us introduce our content to their readers what a terrific marriage that would be for us to provide a deeper and richer experience

1706905 we believe the primary advantages our formulation may have over currently marketed pseudoephedrine tablets relates to the overall efficiency of the formulation
1706906 since pseudoephedrine tablets now face marketing pressure because of required placement behind the counter in the pharmacy we believe that margin and size may play an important role in the selection process for consumers and could give scolr an advantage in the competitive store brands and private label marketplace
1706907 the anda for pseudoephedrine is a major accomplishment for scolr
1706908 approval of this product would further substantiate some of the unique advantages of our drug delivery technology and can be an important revenue contributor to our business in the future

1706918 this strategic agreement is a result of a long term trust based relationship between our two companies covance has proven they can help accelerate drug development timelines and improve efficiencies with lilly which will enable us to further focus on our core competencies in delivering better patient outcomes over the longer term
1706919 this industry pioneering alliance will provide lilly access to covances broad and efficient drug development platforms in addition this collaboration will help us make our fixed cost infrastructure more flexible and continue to grow our portfolio of best in class and first in class pharmaceutical products

1706939 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
1706940 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
1706941 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
1706942 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
1706943 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses
1706944 in recent years elanco has expanded in both sales and product offerings posting record revenues of nearly 1 billion in 2007 elanco also recently launched the lilly companion animal health division and acquired ivy animal health
1706945 as weve grown however the current configuration of greenfield laboratories no longer supports elancos needs the new elanco headquarters will centralize the divisions operations while offering significant savings in annual operating expenses
1706946 what we call years yz the period beginning in late 2011 when patents for several medicines begin to expire requires a thorough transformation of our company that includes reduced cycle times and lower r amp d costs
1706947 as we act decisively we aim to implement these changes with utmost respect for our employees and continued support for the communities in which lilly operates
1706948 nowhere is lillys network strategy more pronounced than in indiana where more than 3 000 firms support the companys work in both national and global markets
1706949 through this collaboration with covance and others lilly will help enhance the regions life sciences sector expanding lillys economic footprint in indiana as never before specifically these partnerships will result in no net job reductions in the state and they will offer the potential for new jobs in the future throughout this process we have worked to put lilly employees and indiana first

1707035 i dont i dont even need a mobile it is nice to have though but when i have a phone i need one that is practical for my purposes beauty comes second
1707036 i was steered away from an iphone by my tech support guy he likes the product but said that for me since i am a heavy email user that the blackberry curve was more functional and practical hed had many customers who werent happy with trying to do lots of email on the iphone
1707037 yes please it is definitely on my nice to have list but only when my contract comes to an end
1707038 folks who arent tech savvy like pushing annoying little buttons enjoy regular service outages prefer work arounds must have the star trek communicator at hand and dont know a widget from a wingnut
1707039 loved them when they came out but like beauty it faded its also kinda like a mac and pc thing i am the proud owner of a moto q 9 and it is fabulous
1707040 i dont i need a qwerty keyboard good coverage and great battery life
1707041 the fees are ridiculous i do like the tap screen however my usage style doesnt justify the expense i also dont like the palm trio i do like the blackberry curve although some users think its software is lame
1707042 i have a perfectly good phone that i only need to recharge every 10 12 days so no thanks
1707043 its a lovely piece of machinery but ill stick with my tried and true lifesaving and virtually indestructable treo
1707044 the iphone is a nice example of creating a need for something i personaly will skip this hyped phone
1707045 the iphone certainly has come a long way i e increased improved features decrease in bugs decreased pricing enterprise compatibility etc however there are a couple of points some of which have already been mentioned that have steered me the other way though the price for the unit is now comparable to other smart and pda phones the service is definitely wallet intensive especially in our current economic state not everybody myself excluded wants to use the phone in a multimedia capacity as the economy gets leaner people are finding themselves way too busy to be using such non utilitarian features others are finding themselves with too much time and out of a job so their uber expensive iphone is a sore reminder of the good ol days the computing power of the iphone certainly exceeds that of my bb pearl but to what end its not quite a laptop replacement the screen and lack of tactile keyboard is limiting for this function nor is it faster than even my oldest of computers and its not necessarily a category killer as there are alternatives that are just as if not faster google htc phones for my business needs the form factor is very big deal if you put the iphone in your pants you stand the chance of either breaking scratching or cracking it so youre left toting it around in your hands as ive seen most iphone users doing conclusion i really enjoy apple products as they are esthetically pleasing function oriented and always on the cutting if not bleeding edge my problem is that i get through the apple excitement curve way too fast and experience serious buyers remorse as apple products are overpriced do i want and iphone yes do i need an iphone probably not as the semi conductor shrinks and competition moves in for at amp t amp apple the prices will decrease and iphone type features will become the status quo if they havent already which leads me to another question is having an iphone the tech equivalent of wearing a rolex
1707046 top ten reasons rep eric cantor is out of step with jews and americans
1707047 cantor is clearly from the right of the right wing of the republican party if mccain thinks that cantor will help him with the jewish community because hes jewish mccain is sorely mistaken in summary cantor is an unknown in the jewish community but the more the community gets to know him the less of him it will like
1707048 knew precisely what he wanted to say about the most intricate issues confronting and concerning israel and expressed himself clearly even stridently on key subjects
1707049 what i can do is assure that i will do everything in my power as president to prevent iran attaining nuclear weapons and i think that begins with engaging in tough direct talks with iran
1707050 israelis and israelis alone have to make decisions about their own security
1707051 republican jewish official spends day lying to reporters about obama
1707052 is the development of the nmd a significant national priority and should it be pursued or should it be dropped in favor of more successful and cost effective systems such as the israeli
1707053 can the nmd protect american interests and is it indeed cost effective
1707054 let me give you a real live example which ive been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but wont cover birth control medication those women would like a choice
1707055 we certainly stand firmly on the side of accountability and we have been a leading voice in that regard
1707056 this is a huge step in ending the impunity associated with the horrific crimes that have occurred in darfur
1707057 so whats the problem if as some of my mormon friends assert the lds church is not opposed to accurate depictions of its history why the harsh criticisms and vitriol thrown at this site its a curious thing really
1707058 i similarly do not desire to receive communications from you concerning my decision to enjoy the blessings of the restored gospel
1707059 no thats not how it went down at all heres a web site read about it yourself
1707060 i think that alone provides an interesting insight into the mind of those that leave the church
1707061 but i think association within a priesthood quorum is very special in a way that friendship outside it is not the sharing of common beliefs and priesthood covenant bonds is part of what makes that relationship special
1707062 argued ad nauseum sic with jordan and a few other clowns
1707063 i dont believe heres why but still want to remain friends
1707064 i am offended by the teachings of the mormon church
1707065 jordan if you lose a unique relationship with eric because hes not part of the quorum then you arent truly planning on interacting with him in any meaningful way
1707066 consider the following as a thought exercise could it be that after you got the girl and the subsidized tier i private legal education that all of a sudden the church is offensive to you and it was time to move on what convenient timing that this whole blog and the hangers on who blindingly lavish praise on anything you write is really a testament to your arrogance self righteousness and your psychological craving for the approval and admiration of others that you dont get in the real world
1707067 could it be that after you got the girl and the subsidized tier i private legal education that all of a sudden the church is offensive to you and it was time to move on what convenient timing that this whole blog and the hangers on who blindingly lavish praise on anything you write is really a testament to your arrogance self righteousness and your psychological craving for the approval and admiration of others that you dont get in the real world
1707068 was my meaning really unclear dpc or do you just like playing word games
1707069 one of my stated purposes in maintaining this blog is to dispel some of the myths often promulgated in the lds church regarding those who leave the fold
1707070 still think equality took the church for a big financial ride with that subsidized education of his
1707071 another funny thing that you wrote was calling people here
1707072 you seem to enjoy this blog as much as the rest of us id say considering the frequent comments and thoughts you leave here
1707073 have you ever heard in a church talk or discussion among members that someone left the church because he thought the churchs policies and practices were unethical
1707074 im coming up on my second anniversary of this blog with over 100 substantive posts during that time ive posted literally thousands of comments at various blogs and mormon discussion groups over the last 3 years
1707075 i am not sure why you are so bothered by that or why you feel the need to repeatedly accuse me of being dishonest
1707076 p eople leave the mormon church because they are offended by its doctrines its practices its beliefs its history its claims or its leaders
1707077 the phrase people leave the church because theyre offended is a way to devalue the experiences or claims of folks who leave
1707078 hes leaving over problems with doctrine and history hes not leaving over milk and cream
1707079 are you implying that there are unreasonable reasons to leave a religion
1707080 did you really take my post as a serious description
1707081 do you think there really is an official backslappers crew

1707187 es muss aber der freie zugang zu allen wichtigen informationen die journalisten brauchen um ihre arbeit zu tun gew hrleistet sein
1707188 ganz klar erkl rt dass diese sperrung von internetseiten nicht akzeptabel ist

1707208 to be honest competition isnt about trying to achieve medals it is all about participation and this is what the fun of competition is about if you merely think of trying to achieve medals then 90 of the time you will disappoint think about it there are over 60 participants in one particular class and there are only a maximum of 3 medals what is the probability chance of getting one of them therefore when you participate in competition dont just think about winning but think about the joy of participating
1707209 ok but still i am nervous about it people may think i am a horrible player

1707218 im sorry mr ambassador local authorities made the decision to violate your citizens rights so even though we have a treaty saying she could speak to the consulate they didnt tell her she could do so and we have to abide by their decision our hands are tied
1707219 we may enter treaties but well pick and choose when we will abide by them

1707227 somebody asked me what i looked for in a man
1707228 then at 42 i thought a man should not be too ugly but bald headed was okay he shouldnt drive off until im all the way in the car usually wear shirts that covers his stomach and remember to put the toilet seat down
1707229 at age 52 i thought a man should keep the hairs trimmed in his nose and ears
1707230 however now that im 72 i just want him to be breathing

1707236 but records show that one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more
1707237 about two thirds of his bundlers are concentrated in four major industries law securities and investments real estate and entertainment lawyers make up the largest group numbering roughly 130 with many of them working for firms that also have lobbying arms at least 100 obama bundlers are top executives or brokers from investment businesses nearly two dozen work for financial titans like lehman brothers goldman sachs or citigroup about 40 others come from the real estate industry
1707238 obamas campaign boasts that small donors are the heart and soul of his presidential bid
1707239 everybody is trying to provide a platform for political exchange cultural exchange
1707240 but we also need a philosophical platform so recently in all my music im interested in trying to find not just the phenomenon of harmonics like water meets fire but an internal basic chinese philosophy
1707241 among all chinese philosophy zen is the most predesigned by the gods for the future
1707242 zen can be the philosophical guide for all people to share in the 21st century i want to pass this zen experience on
1707243 sports music has a specific way to handle speed key changes mode it is very intense
1707244 we had to analyze normal peoples walking speed and sportsmens walking speed and average it we had to find a middle way for the tempo to have the most comfortable pacing for everyone
1707245 in the beginning you are a sports lover and a music lover then you put them together
1707246 now i find that it is quite interesting to see both as one its big fun
1707247 be a key which lets people open the door to china
1707248 then one day i was in beijing and the winner of the olympic gold medal design was announced it was gold and jade together so i started researching this in the chinese encyclopedia
1707249 it is the very high stage of taoism it expresses the highest state of harmony so i decided i wanted to use gold and jade materials to make my music
1707250 so now the gold and jade ensemble serves as the basic ceremonial colors mixed with the china philharmonic symphony and chorus
1707251 we took very very ancient culture and very very modern culture and they will meet at the olympics
1707252 some 20 years ago i was still planting rice in china and now im conducting orchestras in all the great concert houses of the world la scala the met the berlin philharmonic i still cant believe it

1707255 you were told to report to an office and made to swear to leave your family to feed pigs to plant rice for your entire life i cried how could i do this for my entire life in fact the required length of time depended on the purity of your thoughts
1707256 but i had fun the farmers who were experts in ghost operas couldnt let anyone hear their songs but i found a way around this by setting maoist texts to their folk melodies everybody understood the ruse and they loved it since then i became an avant gardist not from new york but from that village in hunan

1707260 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
1707261 it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1707262 out of the hospital feeling great and about to resume normal activities at home
1707263 foc08 ive had some visits to my blog and having visited back i discovered the visitors are from another level of web 2
1707264 the third focus is a more collaborative approach to research our largest and most visible example of this approach is our alliance with the massachusetts institute of technology in the area of bio based materials we already have a number of smaller but equally important academic collaborations underway to develop new technologies we will partner with people in our industries to develop technology but also to commercialize products we will work with customers to develop technology in downstream collaborations we will be involved in government partnerships certainly in semiconductors and biology
1707265 the company has worked very hard to formulate the special relief it would need so that its transition into chapter 11 would have no impact on past present or future customers
1707266 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1707267 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1707268 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude

1707272 anarkisme adalah sebuah sistem sosialis tanpa pemerintahan ia dimulai di antara manusia dan akan mempertahankan vitalitas dan kreativitasnya selama merupakan pergerakan dari manusia
1707273 anarkisme bukan bom ketidakteraturan atau kekacauan bukan perampokan dan pembunuhan bukan pula sebuah perang di antara yang sedikit melawan semua bukan berarti kembali kekehidupan barbarisme atau kondisi yang liar dari manusia anarkisme adalah kebalikan dari itu semua anarkisme berarti bahwa anda harus bebas bahwa tidak ada seorangpun boleh memperbudak anda menjadi majikan anda merampok anda ataupun memaksa anda itu berarti bahwa anda harus bebas untuk melakukan apa yang anda mau memiliki kesempatan untuk memilih jenis kehidupan yang anda mau serta hidup didalamnya tanpa ada yang mengganggu memiliki persamaan hak serta hidup dalam perdamaian dan harmoni seperti saudara berarti tidak boleh ada perang kekerasan monopoli kemiskinan penindasan serta menikmati kesempatan hidup bersama sama dalam kesetaraan
1707274 we feel somewhat vindicated today i think other developers may also
1707275 i think the toughest thing we face now is the credit market
1707276 plaintiffs could not reasonably have relied as a matter of law on the drawings or written representations contained in the advertisement
1707277 is it true you can just trump the consumer protection laws by merely putting words in a contract
1707278 if this was practice the developers who were most deceptive in the ad brochures would be the most successful
1707279 this ruling gives the developer wide ranging room to say whatever they want as long as they change it later in the written contract
1707280 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv

1707283 its a terrible thing for him and our team i think the world of him i hope he gets it taken care of
1707284 i began looking at why they get certain connotations why some are considered bad
1707285 in my thesis i looked at what swear words mean because you can get nouns verbs expletives but really it was just a whole lot of garbage thrown together
1707286 i dont swear in my everyday language but i just thought it was interesting to know why these words are marginal because we still use them why are they excluded why are they bad i was going down that route
1707287 the thesis wasnt actually focused on that as such but it was born out of the idea of wanting to know why these words are on the cusp of language thats where i was coming from but i didnt look too much at it i had loads of ideas but my thesis was a bit disjointed
1707288 i was pushed for time but it helped me understand language you have to realise language is alive its constantly developing new words are born old words die i wanted to appreciate that about language
1707289 but im learning german i cant hear it very well but its my goal to speak fluent german
1707290 for many organizations talented employees are the cornerstone of a competitive advantage if the organization competes based on new ideas outstanding customer service or quick accurate decisions having excellent employees is critical
1707291 of course not every organization must compete on the basis of having the best employees but even those that do not employees are a major source of performance problems growth resistance and lawsuits
1707292 their co workers tend to find the workplace less enjoyable have fewer emotional ties to co workers and generally feel less obligated to the organization the beginning of the article states
1707293 telecommuting may boost morale and cut stress but it can have the opposite effect on those left behind in the office according to a new study

1707298 the most dangerous issues we face are those that have the potential to erode our core ability to perform these include the lack of qualified engineers experienced managers and skilled labor as an industry we must switch our fundamental approach to talent acquisition from buying talent to building talent

1707304 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1707305 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1707306 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1707307 it is not an incident that we are aware of
1707308 an all out struggle to deter criminal organizations from operating on both sides of our common border
1707309 law enforcement operations have led from time to time to innocent incursions by both u s and mexican law enforcement personnel and military units into the territory of both nations and in particular along non demarcated areas of our border
1707310 we always try to solve these incidents in a cooperative fashion and as acknowledged by the border patrol this was the case in the episode at ajo
1707311 withhold further comment on this incident until we see how our leaders handle it
1707312 down to a t and it matched exactly what they mexican soldiers wear
1707313 nobody was ever held accountable particularly galling is the fact that the mexican military often pulls these stunts in humvees donated to them by the american taxpayers we note that border patrol agents have historically driven worn out junk vehicles
1707314 the only thing you can do in that kind of situation is seek cover
1707315 im not going to lose someone in an unfair fight

1707336 although hamdans trial will be seen as a landmark case in the tribunals because it is the first in six years
1707337 the next trial that of khalid sheikh mohammad called the mastermind of the sept 11 attacks will be the real bellwether because it is a case that will raise the issue of harsh interrogations and because it is a death penalty case
1707338 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1707339 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict

1707347 the restatements involve accounting estimates that have no impact on tvas cash position or its ability to meet obligations to creditors customers investors or other stakeholders
1707348 this is a complex set of factors and no single person can be said to be the source
1707349 obviously there is an important interplay between an education system that supplies educated people and a state economy with enough jobs that demand those educational skills
1707350 the reason that economic growth occurred was because far sighted public and private sector leaders figured out how to manage the challenge that was posed by the baby boom what they decided is they were going to invest in the education of that generation and that paid off big time in minnesota now it seems like an obvious decision to have made but if it was other states would have done it too and we wouldnt have done as well

1707357 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them

1707360 when you view a cluster in google news theres a new option to filter sources you can restrict news articles to blogs and to local news sites that are relevant to your query the filters are a good way to find opinionated articles and more up to date information from local sites
1707361 i believe separating blogs and news will clarify the objective and subjective information
1707362 i wanted to be unknown because i just want it to be all about the tunes
1707363 im a low key person and i just want to make some tunes nothing else

1707373 hi stephen this is mrs a you know i have really been wanting my daughter to follow a female teacher but since we have moved to ap lei chau i first enrolled the student there but later they moved to the western district and i taught her piano at her home then i have my daughter learn piano from you however now since i have moved back to the western district i think she should have lesson with a female teacher as a result i think i am going to stop the piano lesson with you from this month which means next lesson onward
1707374 hi stephen i guess i am going to stop the lessons now because i need to find someone who can come to my place and she charges cheaper than you and she is quite good
1707375 greater good that could justify the murder of some meaningless soul

1707384 i met a couple of really good friends there but its only 20 nice people
1707385 it just breeds p all these people walking around with this chicken in a basket fame talking about going to la you know
1707386 every aspect of my life personally and professionally feels so different
1707387 the stakes feel so much higher than they were its inconceivable to me that i could be on the cover of a magazine because people on a magazine dont look like me
1707388 half the reason for getting the band together was so we could play some of the old songs
1707389 we did slane castle in ireland and the v festival before we split in 99 but that was pretty much it
1707390 so it felt good to do glastonbury it felt right it felt like if anything has come out of all this then the verve headlined glastonbury
1707391 we did it well and there was probably more people there on a sunday night than there had been for a long long time
1707392 the biggest bungee jump ive done for a long time
1707393 it was one of the concerts that gave me a longer buzz than others definitely its almost like doing extreme sports or something
1707394 ive never done a bungee jump because i dont need to and thats what that performance was about it was about jumping out of the aeroplane
1707395 reforming the verve is the closest thing white lads have got to a band since led zeppelin to being that large
1707396 that was one of the motivations for me to get to those points again like when you have those brief moments onstage when you think wow this is great
1707397 were just taking it as it comes we set ourselves a goal of being able to fulfil our summer dates were taking it to the album and well see how we do we havent got any major plans
1707398 i dont understand why the verve arent seen like the wu tang clan keeping it alive as a satellite no matter what is going on around you personally between each other
1707399 i certainly would never have started this and signed on a dotted line if somebody had said youre off now like chris martin for the next two years
1707400 its just not where im at im definitely up for coming together to make some music and do some great concerts
1707401 but i dont see why this thing should have to be dormant because i will continue doing my solo stuff
1707402 i do buzz off doing stuff on my own i have gained confidence with that ive beaten a lot of cynics down i m in a very comfortable good place in my mind about that
1707403 set new standards for 8 pm dramas in terms of production values storytelling and casting

1707444 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1707445 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1707446 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1707447 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1707448 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1707449 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission

1707464 the barnes foundation arboretum has always been an interesting place
1707465 but it has been so overshadowed by the art collection that its been all but forgotten except by the hardiest of plant people this could give it a much needed makeover

1707480 cuil pronounced cool is only the latest in a long string of start up companies that have been founded and financed with the goal of competing with google as well as yahoo and microsoft in june google accounted for 61 5 percent of search queries in the united states while yahoo held 20 9 percent and microsoft had 9 2 percent according to comscore some of the most prominent include powerset which microsoft recently bought and wikia which was founded by jimmy wales one of the creators of wikipedia so far none have managed to make a dent in the search market
1707481 some analysts say cuil has potential in part because of the pedigree of its founders this is the most promising thing ive seen in a while said danny sullivan who has followed the online search business for more than a decade and is the editor of search engine land whether they are going to threaten microsoft much less google thats another story mr costello a former researcher at stanford said that with 120 billion web pages cuils search index is larger than any other the company uses a form of data mining to group web pages by content which makes the search engine more efficient he said instead of showing results as short snippets of text and images with links it displays longer entries and uses more pictures it also provides tools to help users further refine their queries mr sullivan said he was unimpressed by cuils claim that its index includes more web pages noting that that could mean users are overwhelmed by a whole bunch of junk but he said that cuils new approach to ranking pages and presenting results could prove to be a hit with some users if it turns out that they have good relevancy i could see that the word of mouth would bring cuil some popularity he said

1707489 you dont want anyone to ever have any kind of mental breakdown like that
1707490 but there are distractions every year at training camp the big thing is not to pay as much attention to it as the media does i mean if you want to feed your family you better worry about yourself and what you are doing first
1707491 the only thing ill say is that i know that coach reid has spent an awful lot of time with that situation ill talk about the players that are in camp here
1707492 extremely healthy conversations brutally honest conversations everything you wanted to say and wanted to ask went on in our conversations
1707493 we agreed to disagree we stood on opposite sides of the fence on a number of issues the no 1 thing i was looking for out of the conversation was is he really committed to playing football for us his mind set based on some of the things that have happened thats not where he was his feeling was based on where he is he wasnt in the right mind set to play
1707494 he was not in the right mind set to be part of this football team the train has left the station i have to keep the train moving if he wants to jump on the train lets go but if he cant get past the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1707495 im just trying to stay focused on the things i can control and thats my practice and leading this team
1707496 the team has backed me the whole offseason and i appreciate that back in march after favre announced his retirement they said i was going to be the guy and theyve stuck with that
1707497 its to the point now where were just tired of it here in the locker room
1707498 just hearing about it hopefully theyll get something done upstairs and they can answer these questions instead of you asking us these questions we just get paid to play football
1707499 im just tired of it bretts a friend however it works out i hope hes happy however it works out i hope rodgers happy i hope whatever decision they make they make the best decision to help us get to the super bowl
1707500 very personal i respect the way he feels this has been something thats been extremely stressful for him and for his family hes got a lot going through his head right now i think hes in a tough spot
1707501 rational optimism leads to stagnation it is irrational optimism that leads to reform

1707508 its expensive and they dont want to ruin it you can pay 30 for a piece of halibut and you dont want it to turn out bad i really want to see more people have successful seafood meals at home
1707509 a squirt of lemon some good olive oil and crusty bread
1707510 its a fish that deteriorates rapidly check for bright shiny skin and a clean aroma
1707511 you want to buy the seafood that looks the best that day

1707514 our children are going to see the collapse of fisheries and this is a call to arms
1707515 all wild fish are going to be commercially extinct and we need to get the message across that theres a problem in the ocean

1707519 ten years ago people wouldnt even know what the word tilapia meant
1707520 its on the tabletops here in nova scotia for heavens sakes its a popular food thats been written up in food magazines people come in and ask for it
1707521 for individuals who are eating fish as a method to control inflammatory diseases such as heart disease it is clear from these numbers that tilapia is not a good choice
1707522 this is a serious problem because they tend to feed the fish vegetable oils for growth and thats not quite what the tilapia is accustomed to getting in its native state
1707523 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business
1707524 due to the loss of telesats contribution to operating income and slightly lower bell operating income
1707525 wireless saw improvements in financial and operating metrics in the quarter including the highest level of postpaid net activations since the fourth quarter of 2005 significant growth in total net activations improvements in churn
1707526 wireline momentum continued with improvements in residential local lines losses for a third consecutive quarter with 34 000 fewer losses than in the same quarter last year continued solid financial results and an ongoing acceleration of our turnaround in the business market
1707527 we were disappointed with our high speed internet business this quarter but we are taking action to improve performance in the second half of the year
1707528 as growth in wireless video and data revenues more than offset declines in local and access long distance and equipment and other revenues
1707529 as part of an organizational realignment focused on the strategic imperative to achieve a competitive cost structure
1707530 how do you create the real possibility for yourself to make mistakes and learn from them

1707533 but it was difficult personally to see my team mates losing games

1707595 we maakten drie appartementen extra dan zien we nog eens iemand dachten we
1707596 wij zorgden er altijd voor dat de huizen goed werden opgeknapt en ingericht dus niet met oude bedden en meubelen en mijn man zei altijd dat er ook een zwembad bij moest omdat anders niemand het zou willen huren
1707597 we hebben er wel tot honderd in ons bestand gehad
1707598 la signora lenstra heeft een intelligente vorm van toerisme ge ntroduceerd
1707599 doordat ze oude panden heeft laten opknappen zijn veel karakteristieke gebouwen behouden gebleven zij heeft ons geleerd hoe wij dit moeten doen zij zag de waarde van deze streek vroeger waren de toeristen voornamelijk op doorreis naar rome of toscane dankzij haar werk blijven ze hier nu ook langer
1707600 ook wij hopen dat het grote toerisme de streek overslaat
1707601 voor de streek is een goede balans tussen toerisme en rust nodig
1707602 maar toen we onze dochter verloren wilden we weg dan mis je eigenlijk de juiste kijk nu zijn de kinderen te ver weg

1707607 ik heb daar nog niet zoveel argumenten voor gevonden de middellandse zee is al tientallen jaren ernstig vervuild en daar is de laatste jaren niet zoveel verandering in gekomen waarom zou dat dan nu opeens zoveel extra kwallen opleveren

1707625 as interns and young architects we usually think of ourselves as sellers hawking our skills to the best firm that will have us what if we instead consider ourselves as buyers investing our skills in the best firm we can find we are the consumers of architectural employment unfortunately we consumers have very little information about the enterprises that were investing in

1707627 residents objected to the parking in the ground and accordingly rs 800 was collected from the violators as fine
1707628 however we denied the permission as there was no specific formal event it was a celebration and we did not see it fit to grant permission
1707629 however the residents objected to the cars being parked at the shivaji park and we had to start from the parsi colony instead of the original spot
1707630 we wanted to start campaigning for the bombay parsi punchayat elections to be held in october and therefore decided to start with a car rally

1707640 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it
1707641 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment in his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is
1707642 and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1707643 theres just such a connotation with grandma and i just liked it better

1707645 i welcome this wake up call of the church of england and i hope that from now on the british national party will be welcomed in every husting organized by the church of england we the bnp have been saying all along that christianity is being eroded and we are fighting to keep christian values alive and well in britain
1707646 christianity is a semitic religion it is creature of the deserts of the middle east not the forests of the northern europe and its symbol the cross is an instrument of torture not of living redemption
1707647 the organic religion of the west was replaced with the theological dogma of the east european man at that moment became seperated from his roots and the insane fratricidal wars that have destroyed the west in the name of the various christian cults began
1707648 christianity could only be implanted in the west via force the forces of chaos at war in the world are the way that the archaic spirituality of the west will return
1707649 christianity took power through violence in the west and as it rotted away its shadow image of liberalism unleashed through its toleration and promotion of evils such as islamic extremism crime degeneracy and filth the same violence that once empowered christianity
1707650 the religion of christianity that preached of peace conquered with war blood and death it had turned the natural organic religions of europe based on the symbolism of the tree a living and growing symbol of perpetual life with the dead symbol of the cross a symbol of horror violence torture obedience and the brutality of rome and the betrayal of the jewish pharisees the symbolism of the cutting down of the tree of life is a symbol found throughout europe wherever christianity killed its way to power
1707651 christianity despises the planet and this is why we are facing the ecologicl crisis of today
1707652 that must be destroyed by the god odin to make way for a bnp order see
1707653 today the violence we see in our society is the prelude to a rebirth of the west a rebith based on ancestral cultures values and an organic religion of nature the violence in our society is the unleashing of the chthonic forces of nature as represented by nidhoggr who exists beneath the world tree yggdrasil this is the dark side of mans unconscious released on the earth with no moral or social constraints for with the fall of christianity and liberalism no moral order exists to control european man
1707654 odinism on the other hand offers european man a way to spiritual wholeness in life
1707655 in odinism the god odin is crucified like christ to a tree unlike christ whose redemption is found only after his death odin survives his torment on the tree and gains the wisdom of the runes and thereby unlocks the secrets of the universe the roots represent our descent from the gods and our connection to the earth the trunk represents our shared european racial heritage the main branches of the tree our nations and tribes the death age of christianity and liberalism has led to the age that william blake regarded as ulro the lowest stage of human life possible where mans innate value has been replaced by his utility value just as christianity grafted itself upon the hewn oaks of our heathen past the new religion that is starting to sprout upon the stumps left behind by christianity and its pimp sister liberalism is a return to an organic and natural religion
1707656 what passes for christianity in this country today can only be described as superstitious sociology a bland doctrine of welfare mongering with guilt humility and self abasement as its cardinal principles

1707662 esper bamos una decisi n en ese sentido amparada en los aspectos legales nosotros como la federaci n alemana de f tbol dfb defend amos que ni el reglamento de fifa ni la pr ctica imponen la obligatoriedad de ceder a los jugadores
1707663 en un estado democr tico la libertad de expresi n es un derecho fundamental que en espa a viene recogido en el art culo 20 de la constituci n la decisi n del coe de prohibir a los deportistas espa oles que hagan declaraciones molestas para el r gimen chino durante su estancia en los juegos bajo la amenaza de retirarles la acreditaci n supone una intolerable coacci n el derecho a expresarse libremente asiste a los deportistas espa oles tambi n en china faltar a m s porque es individual y no se extingue fuera de nuestras fronteras por mucho que el coe apele a la carta ol mpica para vetar las declaraciones de contenido pol tico resulta intolerable que un organismo como el comit ol mpico espa ol avale decisiones que atentan contra principios tan elementales como el de la libertad es de una gravedad extrema que deber a obligar al gobierno a intervenir porque el coe sumiso hasta l mites que ofenden la propia dignidad no est por encima de la ley

1707675 with the politics of energy shifting as rapidly as gasoline prices democrats led by presidential candidate barack obama are retreating from long held positions and scrambling to offer distressed voters more immediate relief from spiraling costs
1707676 sen barack obama altered his position on monday to call for tapping the nations strategic petroleum reserve to lower gasoline prices as he outlined an energy plan that contrasts with sen john mccains greater emphasis on expanded offshore drilling and coal and nuclear technology
1707677 sen barack obama called monday for using oil from the nations strategic reserves to lower gasoline prices the second time in less than a week that he has modified a position on energy issues as he and sen john mccain seek to find solutions to a topic that is increasingly dominating the presidential race

1707826 strategies that are effective for protecting critical business data that reside on servers may not be effective for laptop and desktop computers and vice versa
1707827 protecting data in both places can be complex and challenging but failure to implement a solution that provides a business with total data protection could result in catastrophic data loss and in the worst case may even mean the failure of the business that is why the combined offering of yosemite filekeeper corporate for transparent continuous data protection for the edge of the network and inmage dr scout for well accepted core protection is a powerful solution
1707828 based on the companys flagship dr scout product with technology that combines disaster recovery with cdp and solves other issues such as branch office consolidation the decision to partner with inmage was intuitive
1707829 corporations have seen the need for laptop protection for years but because of the complexity of most laptop protection products they have left it up to the users to copy files to a file share with the simplicity of filekeeper corporate and the combination with dr scout customers can be assured that their information is always protected
1707830 yosemites filekeeper corporate solution is well known for its set it and forget it ease of use for protecting desktops and laptops
1707831 combining this with robust bc dr for production servers and applications will provide customers with unprecedented data protection from the core to the edge of their network as well as a high level of peace of mind

1708053 they were as memorable games as most of the afl games ive played as well its a fantastic thing to be a part of and especially for these young fellows to look back on if their football doesnt progress any further itll certainly be a memorable event
1708054 you sort of see them afl players on the telly all the time but you dont really see how they operate

1708110 i was having a meal at the pub and when i handed over my card to pay they said there was a slight problem
1708111 the manager said it was going to take between 20 30 minutes to sort out they contacted the credit card company and verified that i was the legitimate owner of the card when i got home i found out what had happened
1708112 people need to be alert because it seems to be happening all over out of my e mailing list of 50 local people around a dozen have been affected

1708116 i think we fought hard today and worked hard and handled the heat a lot better than yesterday
1708117 jarius wright made a bunch of big plays and stood out pretty good
1708118 senior running back michael smith made some nice runs and deanthony curtis the true freshman from camden made some nice plays
1708119 but who is the most physical guy who is going to be the hammer and not the nail
1708120 hes going to end up being one of the fastest guys on the team for us
1708121 nathan has really improved since we started spring last year theres no question about that
1708122 i guess it could help us because the first thing you see when you turn on the tv are the uniforms
1708123 but if youre going somewhere for the uniforms theres something wrong
1708124 well always take a break during practice we have fans set up we get a lot of gatorade in them petrino noted the teams new trainer joe sheehan worked for the nfls jacksonville jaguars the past 12 years
1708125 with all the heat and humidity down there he knows how to deal with it
1708126 we want to see how many pounds they lost in practice how many they gained back over the night
1708127 we had a couple of players that lost up to 10 pounds during practice and then they gained it back
1708128 if they dont gain a certain percentage of it back then they dont get to practice the next day petrino said hes not worried about wearing out the razorbacks before the season starts a key he said is getting the players fresh for the opener aug 30 against western illinois
1708129 we need to get our legs back and we need to make sure we are at full speed
1708130 its a real timing of when we want to peak and be at our best for that opening game and were a long way from there so we get to pound them for a while
1708131 it really is an honor for my teammates to select me for that role
1708132 it puts a great amount of responsibility on me to perform and really lead this team
1708133 it feels really good that guys are seeing what im doing and are willing to follow me
1708134 it makes me want to find something deep inside of me to push even harder
1708135 i miss my mustache but i didnt have the look
1708136 i know its something we do laugh about but we sat in on a meeting monday with our chancellor g
1708137 the honest answer is i want to stay one step ahead of the posse
1708138 his shoulder hasnt totally responded and hes still seeing our team doctors and still getting medically evaluated
1708139 we are just trying to doubletrain some of these guys to create more depth
1708140 it means we can take the six best players that the sixth or seventh best isnt limited to just one spot
1708141 once we go through a couple of scrimmages well decide who is the best at which that the best guy can play guard or center
1708142 hes going to end up being one of the fastest guys on the team for us and hes certainly very flexible and has real good hips
1708143 come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have young inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game
1708144 the offensive linemen give the quarterback an opportunity to have some time and space to throw the ball
1708145 i think our defensive line has a chance to really grow and get better
1708146 my first year at louisville 2003 we were picked last or secondto last
1708147 we are just trying to double train some of these guys to create more depth
1708148 it means we can take the six best players that the sixth or seventhbest isnt limited to just one spot
1708149 darren will re join the panel on thursday night hes been away for a few days at this stage his presence will be vital more so than anything else its great to have a player who is willing to help out in whatever way he can and hell be able to give a lot of the players advice on how to prepare for a big game
1708150 people should be aware that this is a good carlow team they have very good underage structures and theyve beaten the likes of offaly at minor in the last few years
1708151 they hurled really well against westmeath and they had 3 18 scored at the end of normal time and halfway through the second half they were 10 points up laois played them in a practice match a few weeks before damien fox stepped down and carlow won so we wont be taking them lightly
1708152 they mean a lot to me and you know how its real easy to lose pieces to the toys or break the toys this way your uncle can keep them nice looking for a long time and when you get older ill let them take them off the shelves and look at them
1708153 well its just that your butt looks like a mushroom especially when you bend over

1708166 i wanted to conform to that image were trying to project
1708167 were way ahead of where we were at the end of spring and were where we need to be but still a long way to go
1708168 the biggest area we need to improve in is taking away the deep ball and the cheap yards
1708169 we walked out on the field on the first day like we were just trying to get through it and it was not up our expectations on this football team
1708170 youve got to pass your man on to the next guy in his zone and that takes trust and communication to get it right
1708171 used to it wasi got him he has him you get him now you have to communicate with your teammates and know a little bit about everyones responsibilities to understand the whole concept of what were trying to do and how everyone has a part and they have to execute it
1708172 everyone has to be on the same page and know instantly who has who in what situation
1708173 all the secondary talks a lot about it and we all talk about different things happening and who covers who in those situations
1708174 it all goes back to accountability youve got to know your assignments and let your teammates know they can trust you to be prepared and to execute the gameplan
1708175 im still going to run around and hit people so that doesnt change
1708176 for us be good weve got to be sound fundamentally physical run to the ball full speed and play mistake free if we fault in any of those areas were not good enough to overcome those mistakes weve got to turn negatives in to positives
1708177 to do all that you have to work hard learn and be confident enough to get it done on game day
1708178 whats up guys the arkansas razorbacks media day was already three hours old by that time and petrino probably about tired of talking was showing redness in the whites of his eyes and puffiness around them
1708179 introduce yourselves i feel like i know yall real well by now its a lot of media days weve had petrino is finding out the football fans in arkansas love their razorbacks information especially this year
1708180 when you go back and watch the video you see good things that maybe you dont see when youre on the field
1708181 for us to be good im not going to say great we have to be technique sound we have to be physical we have to run to the ball full speed and we have to be mistake free
1708182 if we fall in any of those areas fellows were not good enough to overcome robinson said matching up against an offense as diverse and intricate as is run by the petrinos is good preparation
1708183 if we can understand what our offense does to be honest with you were probably not going to see a whole heck of a lot different from anybody we face
1708184 he did a good job of getting everybody out there in the summer and he ran the show
1708185 his confidence level is up and our confidence in him is up
1708186 theyre not as plain as they were last year theyve got some stripes up in there theyve got different colors and theyve got black in there so i mean you cant beat black and red the uas official supplier adidas came up with the style
1708187 i think theyll tie together with the different pants well end up wearing
1708188 we went through the samples and made sure we try to carry on as much tradition as you can senior receiver reggie fish wearing his no 1 modeled the jersey for pictures posted on the universitys web site arkansasrazorbacks com
1708189 i like the styling on it the players are definitely excited about it quarterbacks casey dick and nathan dick weighed in with positive reviews as well
1708190 i think theyre nice and slick and theyre going to look good on us out there
1708191 its very important for us because afghanistan has never won an olympic medal before
1708192 we want to make history and fly our flag in front of the world
1708193 bringing a medal home would help people come together as a country whatever tribe or ethnic group they are from
1708194 it would be a good example to young people so they will take up sport rather than taking drugs
1708195 we had no choice the price increase was solely to cover the cost of feed
1708196 corn and soya bean have tripled while freight costs have doubled over this year

1708199 a stylus or mouse will never replace the feel of a pencil pen or brush in your hand and the connection it creates with the paper or canvas
1708200 i truly hope that there will always be an audience out there who appreciates a more traditional approach to art as much as i enjoy the computer as a tool i dont ever see if replacing my brushes and pencils as my preferred medium
1708201 i think childrens books could use an injection of a little new perspective like with movies the new media has to be used to the best of its capabilities
1708202 the one thing that i seem to hear many hardcore traditionalists say is that digital artists have no actual talent that the computer does all the work for them which is of course not true

1708225 if officer mccloud honestly thought due to legal ignorance or heat of the moment misjudgment or what have you that the photo was either contraband i e illegal in itself or evidence of a crime then deleting it would constitute destruction of evidence and if the photo was neither contraband nor evidence then by definition the police obviously had no right to seize it or otherwise make any demands about it so no matter how you frame the issue mccloud cant win
1708226 i threw the phone back to my 12 year old daughter and told her to keep taking photos

1708228 he then turned to me and said im charging you with disorderly conduct
1708229 disorderly conduct is a charge that police use when they cant think of an actual crime committed

1708268 i think it is an aggressive move a positive move we need to take 20 wickets in this test you need to take 20 in any test and i feel a lot more comfortable with four fast bowlers

1708270 i like steve and what he brings to the team hes had his ups and downs but i have a really good relationship with steve
1708271 he seems as excited as anything and he had a bit of a bounce in his step
1708272 i like steve in the side mooresy coach peter moores and i are singing from the same hymn sheet at the moment its all positive
1708273 get back to playing with a real amount of pride and passion
1708274 once you go over the white line just express yourself and do whatever you need to do to be successful trust your practice trust your instincts and trust what youve done the day before or the week before just go out and do it
1708275 i think there has been a bit of that stuff worrying about little things the more you worry the more you think about stuff instead of being a clear thinking person who does the simple things as good as you can do
1708276 ive been under pressure ever since i came to england eight years ago all day every day so hopefully i can deal with this
1708277 the start of my relationship with smithy was interesting but theres been absolutely no problem in this series hes grown up ive grown up and were just playing cricket to the best of our abilities for our countries

1708280 while baseball may not be my favorite sport the atmosphere in a stadium with so much tradition and history as dodgers stadium has a level of energy that draws you in and takes you to the days of long summers and worrying about homework as i walked down the field level concourse a peanut vendor whom i have gotten to know over the years came up to me and greeted me warmly i dont know what im going to do with myself ive been here for the last 49 years and today is my last day do you know that short asian man that sits down in this aisle he asked me i really didnt feel like telling him i didnt so i simply nodded my head well he came up to me and brought me a roast beef sandwich from cantors deli i just burst into tears when he gave it to me it is one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me im still crying i spoke to the old vendor for a bit longer congratulating him before he ran off to tell his story to someone else the next day someone had told me that he was interviewed by famous dodger announcer vin scully and it was played over the jumbo screen he received an ovation from the crowd and im sure the tears were flowing all weekend its amazing to meet people like that i think that the people i have met over the years have been an incredible blessing while most people obsess over celebrity sightings and their actions and i see many la is an incredible city because of the stories of its people rather than those produced by its industry there are days that seem surreal and while you may find me at the farmers market in the early mornings waiting for the first apple fritters to come out of the oven at bobs or jumping on the early train to san juan capistrano for some tortas at el campeon everyday brings the promise of new adventure may your life be extraordinary whoever you are
1708281 we estimate with obviously imperfect information that we are the market leader
1708282 ultimately we want the driver to have the final control
1708283 this investigation and prosecution sends a strong message about the level of importance we place on protecting of our natural resources
1708284 its not clear at this point which category of vendors ultimately is going to deliver more value to the enterprise
1708285 i think were in a market that could end up looking a lot like the im market
1708286 i believe that were going to move very quickly to the point where people look at it and say information isnt the competitive advantage its the ability to react to the information closer to real time
1708287 i think its fascinating to watch how people use data in ways that you would never expect

1708292 water started coming in i was frightened for my life
1708293 i dont think he knew there was a ditch there
1708294 there came a point where i was like ok its just going to have to stop
1708295 i would still like to strengthen and im confident well bring in at least two possibly three more faces
1708296 if those players are of the quality of the likes of gutierrez and guthrie then well take our chances
1708297 add to that all the players weve got to come back then weve got a strong quality squad with competition for places
1708298 the same one that was made about the israeli palestinian peace process in 1993 but in retrospect what was needed there was a quicker process
1708299 it is not true to say thaksin shinawatra is selling manchester city
1708300 he spoke with garry cook this morning and those were the sentiments he echoed in very strong terms
1708301 lol bitter burnley boys it was a rumor in the press just like corluka
1708302 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly
1708303 we have not brought in the kind of top quality player everyone seems to be expecting
1708304 we are still researching and looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate
1708305 we have the right balance of youth and experience thanks to the work we did in the transfer market the previous year
1708306 in terms of numbers we have been boosted by the return from loan of several young players who have the potential to go all the way
1708307 we have to be a little bit patient i keep saying there are three positions i think we need strengthening in terms of cover or to challenge the players in them positions
1708308 we are trying extremely hard to make some signings but clubs do not want to sell their good players and i understand that
1708309 if somebody comes in for my good players it would have to be a very good offer for you to even consider it
1708310 we are trying hard but obviously the season is coming up very quickly
1708311 we have been linked with hundreds of players and i think it is unfair to comment on players who are under contract at clubs
1708312 keane is a joke he does not no wats he is doing all the players he has signed is weird
1708313 come get him although i dont understand why roy is interested
1708314 i obviously have very good links with real madrid but also with ac milan juventus and other top clubs
1708315 its just a matter of time the mans a shambles
1708316 ive already spent three weeks with the team and we have a very good squad for the new season
1708317 i know the club had a very hard season last year but im confident that this season it will be much better im coming here to be successful
1708318 i know also the situation here with the goalkeepers ive known mark schwarzer for a long time and played against him in the past
1708319 i know hes the no 1 but im here to give my best so that in the end the team is successful thats my mentality
1708320 what we would define as success this season is always a difficult question to answer
1708321 but it is clear there are two trophies we are focused on the premier league and the champions league
1708322 after that the fa cup but we will never go seriously for the carling cup again this year we will have the same philosophy on the carling cup
1708323 the premier league and champions league are the trophies we will fight for
1708324 we want to give hope and belief to all our supporters ahead of the new season and we know we can only do that if we play our usual game full of quality
1708325 it is not wrong to call arsenal a young side still but it is wrong to call us inexperienced
1708326 cesc fabregas for example has already played in a fa cup final a champions league final and also now a european championships final so you cannot say he has no experience
1708327 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1708328 there is competition for places which drives you on but until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on
1708329 ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds or when your time is up at united
1708330 the manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games and then it is time to go
1708331 leave him alone guys he is a regular for the scotland national team
1708332 chelsea fc condemns all forms of discrimination in football and society

1708352 to carry the flame is an honor among many that i have had at previous olympics and at this one but it is the kind of experience that i will appreciate most many years from now when i am older and can look back
1708353 i believe it is an honor that will probably go to one of our older olympians or athletes

1708360 weve had one or two calls about some of our players in the last few days and i think therell be one or two of our players moving out even if theyre on loan
1708361 thats something we have to look at because we have a decent number of players and as a professional footballer youve got to look to be playing games so there are options that we will put to the players
1708362 the ideological blind spots of recent integral theories and practices explored here are three fold the first or fundamentalism is melded to religion the second neo liberalism is appropriated by the power structures of free market economics the third which i refer to as neo conservatism is not so much a consequence of hegemonic desire as it is a consequence of its ordering systemization strategies
1708363 drawing an equivalence between the child and the primitive is couched with hidden dangers
1708364 for anyone who wishes to affirm the innate inequality of races few biological arguments can have more appeal than recapitulation with its insistence that children of higher races invariably ones own are passing through and beyond the permanent conditions of adults in lower races
1708365 criminal anthropology and racist ideology used the primitive as child argument to reinforce their claims about adults atavistic deviants or members of lower races respectively but the argument could be reversed usually with more benevolence to ask what comparative anatomy and evolutionary history had to say about the nature of children recapitulation supplied an obvious general answer we understand children only when we recognize that their behavior replays a phyletic past

1708424 our studies provide a significant step toward solving that issue and could help the future development of new treatments for rare but serious conditions such as infective endocarditis an infection of the lining or valves of the heart
1708425 our next steps are to go after these reservoirs of hiv and although much work needs to be done to find and eliminate them infected people who have access to antiretroviral drugs and who take them as prescribed stand a good chance of leading normal lives
1708426 adding more drugs to current regimens will not further reduce the amount of virus in the blood
1708427 we have already reached rock bottom in using drugs to stop hiv from replicating the trace amounts of virus that remain are coming from viral reservoirs not active replication of the virus

1708433 my sense is that lehman feels a need to take action now to stop for once and hopefully for all the constant stories and rumors swirling around the company
1708434 it is now possible that clients are thinking about their long term relationship with the company because the stories will not die
1708435 these clients are becoming increasingly unwilling to make commitments for more than short term activities lehman must therefore act to solidify existing customer relationships
1708436 it would likely look to sell these assets as their value has been the target of much speculation in the marketplace

1708439 my conviction is simply that the firm must cleanse its balance sheet of these securities to re establish confidence and it will do so no matter the cost

1708451 this study is very important from the viewpoint of finding synergies between electrical energy and chemical energy stored in hydrogen
1708452 the study shows that currently hydrogen is not profitable solely for electricity storage on the other hand it might be economically acceptable to produce hydrogen from electricity at advantageous electricity hydrogen prices furthermore hydrogen is shown to be a highly favorable option when there are electricity transmission constraints in the area limiting sales of electricity of a power producer
1708453 hydrogen production might become profitable when the hydrogen economy becomes fully mature i e when the demand and correspondingly prices for hydrogen increases expected mainly from the transportation sector
1708454 this might happen when the prices of fossil fuels rise as a result of many different possible factors e g shrinking reserves higher demand political instabilities co 2
1708455 in this context it is also important that research into hydrogen production storage transmission distribution and consumption components wins the battle with the electron economy where the energy carrier is considered to be electricity those two economies compete in many different areas such as efficiencies durability and prices currently hydrogen is advantageous in terms of higher energy density and durability but still lags in efficiencies

1708469 i cant even really describe how it feels to be representing my country at the olympics
1708470 its been a long journey for me as i made the squad in 1998 i didnt quite make the cut for the sydney olympics and was one of the last two people cut for in 2004 that really hurt but i think it makes this moment even sweeter lately i have been looking back through the past ten years and there are so many people that i owe thanks to so many people that helped me out in some particular way i cant even begin to name them all but my three years at ub definitely helped pave my way to this moment i learned so much from all of the coaches there and the culture of family within the athletic department is something i will always fondly remember to this day i still keep track of the bulls to see how the athletes are doing
1708471 they get into their car theyre taxed they go to the gas station theyre taxed they go for lunch theyre taxed this goes on all day long tax tax tax tax tax even when they go to bed you can go to bed in fear that you are going to be taxed while youre sleeping that there is a sleeping tax
1708472 what a wonderful fort are you ready to take it all down now
1708473 selbstverst ndlich ist das 1000 km rennen auf dem n rburgring f r audi etwas besonderes wir haben die m glichkeit den deutschen fans unseren r10 tdi zu pr sentieren und ganz nah am geschehen zu sein
1708474 das m chten wir nat rlich gerne wiederholen und freuen uns auf ein spannendes rennen
1708475 au erdem gab es ein bisschen urlaubszeit und damit die m glichkeit ein wenig die batterien aufzuladen
1708476 le mans hat gezeigt dass die konkurrenz weiterhin mit uns rechnen muss die mannschaft ist stark und nach dem erneuten erfolg beim schwersten rennen der welt hoch motiviert
1708477 es wird fast st ndig berholt und pausenlos action geboten durch die dauer des rennens von rund f nf stunden ist das motorsportereignis 1000 km rennen schon ein ganz spezielles
1708478 wir wollen aktiv mitarbeiten und helfen dass diese serie den stellenwert und die akzeptanz bekommt die sie verdient hat
1708479 zudem ist es f r audi eine sehr gute pr sentations plattform
1708480 beim 1000 km rennen bringen wir das einzigartige flair des 24 stunden rennens von le mans in die eifel
1708481 das war schon eine schande denn das team und ich h tten diesen erfolg verdient gehabt
1708482 in einem sehr wichtigen moment der meisterschaft hatten wir ein perfektes rennen aber leider haben wir die schon sicher geglaubten zehn punkte aus den h nden gegeben
1708483 lewis hat auch nicht gewonnnen das beruhigt mich mit einem blick auf die gesamtwertung schon etwas
1708484 wir haben zwar zehn punkte verloren doch zumindest haben wir unsere st rke demonstriert
1708485 das war der entscheidende moment ich habe dar ber vor dem rennen viel mit meinen ingenieuren gesprochen ich wusste dass ich dank unseres startsystems einen guten start haben konnte ich habe damit gerechnet dass ich kovalainen berholen k nnen w rde denn meine saubere seite der strecke war ein vorteil
1708486 vor dem start haben wir auch dar ber nachgedacht wie wir hamilton schnappen k nnten und der einzige weg dazu war ein guter start als ich dann kovalainen berholt hatte habe ich mein auto hinter dem anderen mclaren platziert als er mich kommen sah ging er sofort nach innen um sich zu verteidigen da wusste ich dass dies der entscheidende moment f r einen berholversuch sein w rde
1708487 ich dachte dass ich es vielleicht nicht schaffen w rde aber dann bekamen die r der wieder grip und ich bekam die kurve meine beschleunigung war besser als die von hamilton und ich lag vorne
1708488 ich konnte langsamer fahren denn ich lag 23 sekunden vor heikki ich machte mir keine sorgen ich konnte jede pace gehen die ich wollte auch mit den superweichen reifen gab es keinen rger denn ich musste nicht ans limit
1708489 das war ein albtraum und ich wollte aufwachen ich konnte aber nicht aufwachen denn ich war ja wach das war eine unglaubliche entt uschung dieser sport kann richtig grausam sein

1708491 to bypass the neurotoxicity new anti mitotics are being generated early clinical studies show that these drugs do not result in significant neurotoxicity the big question now is whether they will have anti tumour effects
1708492 to help determine this we need to know which types of tumours are likely to be sensitive to these new agents and which ones are likely to be resistant
1708493 to predict which types of tumours are likely to respond we first need to know how anti mitotic drugs work both the classical drugs and these new agents
1708494 we know that anti mitotic drugs block the final stage of the cell division process mitosis how the cells then die is a mystery
1708495 we embarked on a fresh more direct approach that is actually quite simple basically we just watched the cells using time lapse microscopy this allowed us to track the behaviour of individual cells and determine their fate when exposed to different anti mitotic drugs
1708496 the first thing we realised was that the picture was much more complicated that we originally thought the range of different behaviours was profound not only did cells from different cell lines behave differently but cells within the same line also behaved differently
1708497 the level of complexity was at first overwhelming however as we slowly made our way through the data patterns began to emerge this allowed us to formulate a new hypothesis we were then able to design more experiments to test this hypothesis
1708498 in essence it turns out that when cells are exposed to these drugs they arrest in mitosis
1708499 the factors influencing the race not only vary from cell line to cell line but also within cells from the same line explaining why there is so much complexity
1708500 what we want to do now is figure out how we can help the cell death pathway win the race more often this would hopefully mean that the anti mitotic drugs would be better at killing cancer cells first we want to test this idea in the lab but hopefully in the longer run this will mean that these drugs can be used more effectively in the clinic
1708501 karen a talented graduate student worked very hard on this study and the work was only possible because the faculty recently bought a fully automated microscope that allowed us to analyse such large numbers of cells
1708502 our systematic single cell based approach to describe how different tumour cells respond to these drugs has given a data set that provides an invaluable resource and an intellectual framework for dissecting how anti mitotic agents kill tumour cells
1708503 victimization may not only reinforce the negative self concepts that a risk factor for victimization such as obesity may cause but a risk factor for victimization such as obesity will also make it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized indefinitely in other words the risk factors that strengthen the links in this pathway will also keep the pathway intact because it is also a risk factor for being victimized
1708504 the current study suggests that a risk factor for being victimized such as obesity may play an important role in the long term effects of victimization by making it more likely that the adolescent will be victimized over the long term but also that victimization can reinforce the negative self perceptions that the adolescent already has
1708505 it is important to go beyond using obesity as a predictor of long term adjustment and examine the processes and experiences of obese individuals that might cause depression or changes in health
1708506 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children who have been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma
1708507 antibiotics are given to treat the respiratory condition and rather than being a cause of asthma as has been previously suggested they are used for chest infections which can indicate an increased risk of asthma or be mistaken for it
1708508 interactions of s aureus with fibronectin were first reported more than 30 years ago and yet we still dont understand precisely how and why the bacteria target this human protein
1708509 our studies provide a significant step toward solving that issue and could help the future development of new treatments for rare but serious conditions such as infective endocarditis an infection of the lining or valves of the heart
1708510 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
1708511 environmental change is one of the big challenges facing the world today these long term data on the seasonal appearance of flying aphids not only show that there are already noticeable changes in the uk climate but they also provide the knowledge which will help to mitigate the consequences
1708512 water as we know it does not exist within our bodies
1708513 water in our bodies has different physical properties from ordinary bulk water because of the presence of proteins and other biomolecules proteins change the properties of water to perform particular tasks in different parts of our cells
1708514 while it is well known that water plays an important role in the folding process we usually only look at the motion of the protein
1708515 this is the first time weve been able to look at the motion of water molecules during the folding process
1708516 water can be viewed as a designer fluid in living cells
1708517 our experiments showed that the volume of active water was about the same size as that of the protein
1708518 we previously thought proteins would affect only those water molecules directly stuck to them
1708519 now we know proteins will affect a volume of water comparable to their own thats pretty amazing

1708542 sponsoren wollen sich in einem team engagieren dass rennen gewinnen kann
1708543 daher betrachte ich dieses wochenende als eine gelegenheit mein team in die victory lane zu bringen
1708544 m sste ich einen piloten bezahlen dann w rde ich wahrscheinlich in problemen stecken
1708545 ein zweites auto w rde uns dabei helfen schneller l sungen zu finden
1708546 timo vom crash in hockenheim zum podium auf dem hungaroring wie f hlt man sich
1708547 einfach unglaublich ich konnte es kaum glauben als ich sah wie bei felipe massa drei runden vor schluss der motor ausfiel und ich damit an zweiter stelle lag in den schlussrunden setzte mich kimi r ikk nen unter druck als ich nach dem letzten boxenstopp mit den weicheren reifen etwas zu k mpfen hatte wir wussten aus dem freitagstraining dass die weichen reifen schwieriger sein w rden
1708548 ich hatte eine brauchbare pace und lag neun sekunden vor kimi das team sagte mir aber dass er eine halbe sekunde pro runde schneller war als ich ich versuchte einfach zuzulegen und konzentrierte mich darauf die reifen nicht zu ruinieren am ende holte er mich ein ich bin aber cool geblieben und habe daf r gesorgt dass ich keine fehler machte ich wusste aus der gp2 wie schwer in budapest das berholen ist und in der formel 1 ist es sogar noch schwieriger
1708549 du hast dich in ungarn als f nfter qualifiziert dein bisher bester startplatz und dazu dann das podium wie erkl rst du dir diesen fortschritt
1708550 in hockenheim hatten wir im rennen bis zu meinem crash eine gute pace und diese haben wir gehalten als wir nach budapest kamen der tf108 f hlte sich vom freitag an wirklich gut an und es waren keine gr eren nderungen erforderlich er war einfach perfekt jedenfalls bis zum letzten stint mit den weichen reifen mit denen es etwas komplizierter wurde f r mich ist dies die erste volle saison in der formel 1 und schon nach der h lfte stehe ich auf dem podest ein tolles gef hl das war ein perfektes wochenende
1708551 du hast in der er ffnungsrunde gleich nach dem start den bmw von robert kubica versetzt und dich an die vierte stelle gesetzt wie wichtig war das
1708552 ziemlich wichtig wenn man bedenkt wie die dinge ausgegangen sind weil robert ein schweres rennen hatte ich musste meinen start verbessern weil meine reaktionszeiten in den ersten rennen nicht perfekt gewesen waren dieses mal ist der start toll gelaufen und obwohl das qualifying gut gewesen ist hatte ich das gef hl dass ich eigentlich noch einige pl tze weiter vorn h tte stehen k nnen
1708553 im q2 war ich der zweitschnellste hinter dem ferrari von massa mit wenig sprit im q3 hatte ich dann aber einige probleme mit den reifentemperaturen ich bin meine bestzeit mit schon gebrauchten reifen gefahren da ich die reifen f r die erste fliegende runde des letzten runs nicht auf temperatur bekam weil kubica auf der out lap etwas langsamer war und ich zur ckhalten musste ich habe auf der fliegenden runde etwas performance verloren war am ende aber mit startplatz f nf zufrieden auch wenn ich das gef hl hatte dass ich schneller gewesen w re als robert
1708554 hat sich etwas grundlegendes ge ndert das euch bei der performance geholfen hat
1708555 ich mag keine autos die untersteuern und das war in dieser saison manchmal ein problem in hockenheim und budapest ging das fahrgef hl des autos viel st rker in meine richtung und passte besser zu meinem fahrstil ich konnte es eben so durch die kurven bringen wie ich wollte und das war im qualifying wie auch im rennen der fall
1708556 ich hatte das gef hl dass ich eigentlich noch einige pl tze weiter vorn h tte stehen k nnen
1708557 nein bis ich in das medical centre kam war ich noch berzeugt dass ich gepatzt hatte und mit meinem schwer betankten auto ein bisschen zu weit au en ber den randstein gegangen war ich hatte etwas aufsitzen gesp rt und dachte es k nnte mein eigener fehler gewesen sein dann sagte mir das team dass die hinterradaufh ngung gebrochen war und das die ursache des crashs gewesen war
1708558 als ich es das erste mal gesehen habe sah es spektakul rer aus als es sich im auto angef hlt hat sicher hat mir der erste anprall etwas r ckenschmerzen gegeben und ich muss wohl gerade im falschen moment geatmet haben weil es mir auch den atem etwas verschlagen hat ich h tte am abend eigentlich das krankenhaus verlassen und nach hause gehen k nnen man hat mich aber nach dem blichen verfahren ber nacht zur beobachtung dabehalten
1708559 wie war es sich tagelang in den schlagzeilen zu sehen
1708560 all die fragen zu beantworten hat mich wahrscheinlich st rker mitgenommen als der ganze crash ich will schlagzeilen mit rennergebnissen machen nicht mit unf llen schlimmer war eigentlich eine leichte lebensmittelvergiftung die ich mir in der woche danach in jerez geholt habe die hitze war in ungarn kein problem aber als ich w hrend des rennens kr ftig fl ssigkeit zu mir nahm hatte ich wieder einige magenbeschwerden nach dem rennen habe ich mich nicht so toll gef hlt die hitze war aber nicht das gr te problem
1708561 glaubst du dass das team jetzt gut f r den vierten rang in der konstrukteursmeisterschaft platziert ist
1708562 das feld ist sehr konkurrenzstark und je nach kurs oder bedingungen ist vielleicht mal red bull st rker und im n chsten rennen sind es dann wieder wir es geht auf und ab und ist schwer vorherzusagen der tf108 hat aber eine gute performance unter hei en bedingungen demonstriert und wir sind immer zuversichtlich
1708563 was weist du ber den neuen kurs von valencia wo das n chste rennen ausgetragen wird
1708564 ich habe ihn in einem computer game studiert bin um den kurs gelaufen und habe einige bilder von einem f3 rennen gesehen das dort vor kurzem stattgefunden hat f r einen stra enkurs scheint er recht interessant zu sein
1708565 welche privaten pl ne hast du f r die sommerpause
1708566 ich denke dass ich bei gem bleiben kann aber im rennsport ndern sich die dinge ganz schnell
1708567 fast alle unsere sponsoren haben in beiden l nder gesch fte laufen ich denke fast wir sehen hier den beginn eines trends
1708568 es war immer zu nass f r slicks und zu trocken f r regenreifen
1708569 wir hatten immer noch die sorgen aus oschersleben wir bekamen die reifen einfach nicht auf haltbarkeit wir haben dann die ganzen trainingssitzungen daran gearbeitet auch im qualifying die startposition ist bei einem solchen 24 stunden rennen nicht so wichtig
1708570 bei meinem ersten stint blieb ich auf slicks w hrend alle ferraris auf regenreifen wechselten da konnte ich einige zeit gutmachen
1708571 es war f r die jungs an der box extrem schwierig auch f r die fahrer war es hart in der nacht sp rtest du dass es nass ist aber du konntest keinen regen auf der frontscheibe sehen
1708572 ich habe vor diesem jahr immer davon getr umt mal mit valentino zu k mpfen jetzt fahre ich in der gleichen klasse und will ihn einfach nur schlagen
1708573 es ist nat rlich schwierig weil er das gr te talent ist aber ich konnte ihn gleich im ersten rennen schlagen und war auch in barcelona ganz nah dran

1708615 this is a major phenomenon that could endanger the cinema and audiovisual industry
1708616 with these skills on board leaders are more aware of their own taken for granted assumptions and more tuned into what is going on at each moment in their firm and in the market leaders become more open to different ideas and solutions instead of cutting these off and they learn how to turn the diversity of people they have around them into a powerful asset
1708617 in past periods of economic uncertainty leaders have used a no nonsense command and control approach to tackle the challenges of a changing environment
1708618 this according to emerging research however may not be the best way forward today the top down mechanistic approach that assumes there is only one way may just do more harm than good
1708619 the work of author margaret wheatley highlights just how things can go wrong with this approach in her article on the lessons to be learned from hurricane katrina leadership lessons for the real world the poor response from authorities to the crisis showed why more responsive more tuned in leaders and organisations are needed rather than those rigid and bureaucratic in nature

1708634 perhaps our scheduling could have been a little timelier perhaps we could have organized this a little earlier
1708635 that being said we do believe we contacted both candidates offices in a timely manner
1708636 we are a week away from an election and a lot of groundwork needs to be done
1708637 hes already the endorsed candidate by the democratic party and therefore taking time out to have a debate on issues this late in the campaign is just not the best way to reach voters
1708638 elections you win them in the streets not at debates
1708639 we owe it to him and his legacy as well as all of us in this community to know who dares run for this office who dares stand in the shoes of bill dyson
1708640 i think that people should see us juxtaposed against one another and judge our ability to answer questions on the spot and our knowledge of the issues
1708641 one of the things you should be whenever youre running for office is available and thats what im going to be tonight
1708642 and i cry a lot about what happens in the community i live in and it drives me to do something more about whats going on its not about whether im going to have my name on television its not about whether people are going recognize me when i walk down the street its about if another kid is going to live to see 17 years old
1708643 when you look at who is going to represent you when you look at what they have been doing not what theyre promising you but what they have been doing and if youre looking at this race and youre serious about this race and look at whos been working in this community theres only one choice you can make
1708644 the candidate who got the nomination is the mayors candidate not the peoples candidate and the mayor told him not to be here tonight
1708645 if you cannot control the black leadership you get someone you can control to run
1708646 this has nothing to do with the mayor and to make those implications is like reaching for straws
1708647 he hasnt spoken with the mayor hes not the mayors candidate
1708648 to say anything else is to look for an excuse for why they waited this long to do something
1708649 they had plenty of time to step up and have a forum earlier than this
1708650 pok mon as a metaphor for knowledge management gotta catch em all
1708651 isnt something you do rather its the result you get when you do a lot of other things right
1708652 what fascinates me most about a lot of the km literature that i read it sets km way up in mount olympus and then gives the most dodgy convoluted wordy directions to getting there still as a km practitioner im not completely on board with the idea that knowledge management isnt something you do
1708653 as a student of obvious adams i am in total agreement with your skepticism of a big expensive capital letter km engagement
1708654 i say forward looking because its important not to get caught up in trying to capture past behaviors practices if that knowledge is still relevant it will come if it isnt then its useless anyway
1708655 and yes theres always a learning curve and there are always folks who are either late to the party late adopters or who never arrive non users but you can increase adoption through a combination of marketing an internal viral campaign and word of mouth via early adopters advocates and by making use of tools resources that are already being used
1708656 as to the busy ness of people with the valued knowledge unless your km is charles xavier youre never going to get it all anyway
1708657 however by having specific needs and focused questions using the aforementioned process and leaving the analysis of that information to someone well suited to the task you make the process minimally invasive minimally irksome and most importantly relevant
1708658 my personal experience is that its not sharing that people have a problem with its having to info dump indiscriminately and do it in tidy little chunks easily digestible by the masses make the process convenient and intelligent to the full range of your consumers and you just might get somewhere
1708659 in the current case ivins complained privately that fbi agents had offered his son andy 2

1708661 she sacrificed all this stuff because she wanted to do the right thing
1708662 that would link this strain of anthrax to dr ivins lab
1708663 using new genome technology researchers looked at samples of cells from the victims to identify the kind of anthrax ames strain that killed them the scientist said they noticed very subtle differences in the dna of the strain used in the attacks than in other types of ames anthrax
1708664 the science is known as dna fingerprinting although any two samples of anthrax bacteria will likely share roughly the same dna structure there are tiny differences from sample to sample
1708665 the new genome technology that tracked down ivins was either not available or too expensive to use often until about three years ago

1708710 corporate types by and large seek to fuel growth by building from bulletproof reproducible systems designers generally attempt to do so by imagining something new different better that difference can be seen as a trust in reliability on the one hand and in validity on the other
1708711 a reliable process which tends to attract folks in finance engineering and operations produces a predictable result time and again
1708712 a valid process on the other hand flows from designers deep understanding of both user and context and leads them to ideas they believe in but cant prove

1708716 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
1708717 future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period if found to be effective such interventions may prevent the devastating impact associated with postpartum suicide attempt

1708719 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
1708720 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
1708721 why most executives prefer the known to the unknown its a lot easier and safer to run a billion dollar business than it is to invent one
1708722 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1708723 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1708724 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
1708725 the effects of todays rough economy can certainly be felt on most everyones pocketbook
1708726 when trimming grocery lists or school meal plans to save money its important to remember the nutritional and economic value that nutrient rich foods like milk provide for our children milk cheese and yogurt are especially critical for growing children as they contain a unique combination of nine essential nutrients critical for bone health and development
1708727 our next steps are to go after these reservoirs of hiv and although much work needs to be done to find and eliminate them infected people who have access to antiretroviral drugs and who take them as prescribed stand a good chance of leading normal lives
1708728 adding more drugs to current regimens will not further reduce the amount of virus in the blood
1708729 we have already reached rock bottom in using drugs to stop hiv from replicating the trace amounts of virus that remain are coming from viral reservoirs not active replication of the virus
1708730 how to survive being voted off the island during a recession
1708731 ask not what km might could do for your organization get off your butt and show them
1708732 somebodys always making money even in a recession so if you can find out where those pockets are and if you have services you can provide to them maybe you want to expand those services
1708733 if an economic recession does occur choose not to participate everyone else will be cutting back weakening their companies they will let go of people who might be hungry enough to be your next superstar the weakest of them may fail or come close to it almost anyone can run a company successfully during good times during less prosperous times the real management shows itself by preparing for the next boom and strengthening themselves
1708734 the size of organisms tends to be constrained by a scaling principle scientists call surface to volume ratio
1708735 as the organism grows this surface to volume ratio declines in a way this is how nature keeps the sizes of various species in check
1708736 the average size of the prey captured by the colony increased 20 fold as colony size increased from less than 100 to 10 000 spiders
1708737 so even though the number of prey falls sharply as the colony grows the biomass that individual spiders acquire actually increases
1708738 there simply arent enough large insects in those areas to sustain this type of foraging behaviour
1708739 and because it winds itself up to the forest canopy and spreads it can cover as much canopy area as a community of trees
1708740 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c02
1708741 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
1708742 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance
1708743 the orders data are some further evidence flagging up significant recession risks and therefore implying that the ecbs next move will be a rate cut albeit not for some time
1708744 we believe the ecb will be careful not to sound too dovish though as it does not want to fuel expectations of rate cuts
1708745 however it may be difficult to control this and if anything we see a chance of slightly lower yields on the back of the statement

1708752 people are fully aware of how much hardship there is out there but are often at a loss as to how they can help when it comes to getting people to rally together and help the needy radio is tremendously powerful because of its intimacy and ability to communicate with listeners on a one to one basis listeners build trust in and rapport with the presenter and this is the key success ingredient of radio in social conscience
1708753 when presenters make on air appeals they are meaningful and usually deeply emotional hence people further trust the brand they know that every cent will go towards the cause while someone may be less hesitant to give out money on the streets having a recognized and respected radio personality making a plea to help someone in need and leading by example strikes a chord with listeners as the appeal is so much more personal

1708762 the findings in this study may be considered encouraging in many ways the average amount of alcohol has decreased in more recently born cohorts the percentage of the population exhibiting moderate alcohol intake has been increasing steadily and the percentage reporting heavy drinking has decreased over time while these data suggest the development of more favorable patterns of alcohol consumption over the latter part of the 20th century that also show that at the same time the cumulative incidence of alcohol use disorders has not shown a decrease and continuing efforts at preventing them are warranted
1708763 bio fuels from wood are the area in which norway and sweden have most to gain
1708764 technically and economically it is possible to extract as much as 20 kilowatt hours kwh of energy a year in norway in addition to todays withdrawal
1708765 in order to achieve this large amounts of bio mass are required possibly as much as one million tonnes
1708766 the most accessible bio masses have already been harvested so we have to go further out and higher up we can increase profitability if this is carried out in connection with other measures to add value such as thinning sites for tourism power lines roadsides urban biomass and agro waste
1708767 lignin is the compound that cross links different fibres and enables the tree to stand vertically up to one third of the dry mass of the wood is lignin
1708768 compared to cellulose lignin has not been exploited to the same degree but it can now be utilised for biodiesel and other fuel components the challenge is to develop oil resembling todays oil products from fossil sources
1708769 we added a special solvent that conveyed the hydrogen to lignin
1708770 in this way we managed to break the lignin down into several products including pyrolysis oil that can be mixed into the petrol
1708771 the entire tree must be converted into different products in an effective refining process
1708772 lignin can now be used for biodiesel turpentine charcoal and other fuel components with optimal refining it is possible to exploit 60 80 percent of the energy that is conveyed and the process can be profitable in the space of 10 years
1708773 norway has oil refineries that produce different chemicals and there is nothing stopping us from establishing bio refineries that use wood and agricultural products to make similar products
1708774 borregaard and norske skog are both experts when it comes to processing wood a bio refinery like borregaard currently makes around 250 products from lignin
1708775 brazilian authorities believe their production of bioethanol from sugar cane does not compete with food production
1708776 we can achieve commercial production in norway within five years
1708777 part of our nordic collaboration project is to study whether existing oil refineries or paper mills can be used to produce bioethanol

1708783 the surgical treatment of serious ocd is a very powerful one but as well as being effective it also has potentially serious side effects
1708784 in each and every case its a difficult challenge to weigh the dangers against the benefits
1708785 i think the risks of capsulotomy might have been underestimated
1708786 more research is needed on refined methods of determining the site of operation our mr analysis of these sites suggest that surgery could be safer and more effective if it was more localised its essential to find efficacious and safe treatments for the most seriously ill

1708803 the oral care sector is a largely untapped category of the chewing gum market in south africa and is primed for exponential growth given the increased focus on health and wellbeing berge farrell was selected for this project as a direct result of the companys commitment to creating packaging design that works as hard as every other element of the marketing mix
1708804 the growth of the brand depends on consumer buy in to the brand proposition and consumer buy in depends to a large degree on trust consumers trust brands that say the same thing every time they encounter it at every space in which they encounter it we help create that trust not only through a variety of consistent non verbal cues on the packaging itself but also by ensuring that the packaging ties in seamlessly across the brand and also with the communication of the brand proposition at every other level
1708805 it might sound clinical but the end result has retained the freshness and youth of the dentyne brand simultaneously communicating the practical oral care benefits of the brand and the emotional benefits of loving your smile
1708806 this kind of research proves the importance of every element of the brand from the product itself to the pack in which it is presented its this attention to detail that we hope will ensure dentynes continued leadership in the category
1708807 at berge farrell were committed to results we believe that packaging plays a crucial role in the marketing mix and we pride ourselves on our ability to make that role a starring one

1708839 it will be difficult to break the top 4 for example i say ignore him and move on
1708840 i watched the game and i saw an awful lot of it
1708841 its what i call one of those indefensible ones you cant defend against them
1708842 for my money duff servicing people from the left with his balls in there is the best option

1708844 when he beats it away he beats it away it doesnt just drop in front of him
1708845 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1708846 we did ask gbb to go back to the court and ask them for mulching machines because they mayors are constantly clearing the sides of the road for safety and whatever reason and our residents dont
1708847 activities such as poetry story telling oral arts or like chanting things of this nature that involve the language
1708848 thats not something that is permitted in the cba its not something we are going to allow and something should they decide to do we will have to manage it the way we would manage any other violation of the collective bargaining agreement
1708849 i think it was a show of unity i think we felt that the cba collective bargaining agreement had been violated in terms of our rights and negotiating with our clubs an extra bonus for this tournament we also felt that it had been set up as if a million dollars was going to the winner and thats not the case we were a little disappointed in the way the tournament had been handled but on the same token its a great tournament and there are great teams in the tournament
1708850 well see how the grievance goes thatll be in the fall well see where we go from there you know i think the fact that we shared the money was to show that were unified as a group it seemed the comments made about the fact that we were splitting the prize showed that the line is drawn in the sand and theres going to be conflict but i think the players are ready for that
1708851 as players were very disappointed and the fact that we werent allowed to negotiate the prize and although were happy with the money at the same time if theyre saying that the mexican teams get twice as much as we do we dont feel thats fair if youre going to add this tournament give us a chance to negotiate prize money thats fair and equal to every team
1708852 we didnt want it to be a situation where were kicking the crap out of each other we know that theres bigger things in this year and if the league are going to add these extra games on at least make it fair for us to have a chance to play for the same thing that the other teams in the tournament are playing for it was a sign of solidarity between both teams and all the mls teams that were in it
1708853 we wanted to make sure that everybody is playing for the rest of the games this season and not getting any injuries in this game where were a little disappointed in the prize money
1708854 every player feels that this tournament is a great tournament and were excited to play in these games and you could see even though were making half of what other teams are making we still fought just as hard
1708855 the interesting thing is that it seems like the players are ready for a fight and why shouldnt they be the revolution and dynamo were put in a position to play five extra games and the prize money they receive really is insufficient compensation for their efforts in the tournament
1708856 in our club we make sure players receive x of the purse from any outside tourney
1708857 i dont know how all of a sudden this became whether through the media or through the player that the only thing that matters in this tournament is the prize money i dont ever hear that in mls i dont hear that in the world cup
1708858 i think jay is a great acquisition for us and were still on the look out for more
1708859 hes had maybe one or two seasons where people say hes not fulfilled his potential

1708869 if standardization of the nutrition practice is left in the hands of a single professional organization the potential bias caused by financial arrangements raises important questions it is a dangerous mistake to establish in law a monopoly on nutritional counseling
1708870 this is a commercial enterprise and we need to be making broader movies
1708871 as much as we like these art house and smart house movies we can only make one or two of them we cant afford to make a slate of them

1708883 second quarter core business revenue increased 84 5 percent on a year over year basis and 23 2 percent sequentially reflecting robust demand for our advisory and implementation services across all of our markets and the positive impact of recent acquisitions

1708888 all we want is for hsbc to facilitate the delivery of our presents
1708889 we believe this would be easily achieve and could actually be cheaper than organising refunds the deliveries could be organised at cost price and would be a huge publicity coup for them it could save them money as well
1708890 i will not be joining the march no way wrapit is wholly responsible for getting themselves in this mess why should they expect hsbc to bail them out
1708891 the company directors have made several statements and suggestions for a resolution for outstanding orders none of which hsbc considers appropriate or practical
1708892 hsbcs view is that this should never have happened and had the directors acted sooner to address their financial difficulties and appointed administrators when hsbc recommended it may not have
1708893 hsbc fully appreciates how wrapits customers feel about this issue and understands their distress and concern that a resolution be found quickly
1708894 hsbc again refutes any suggestion that hsbc was responsible for the companys failure
1708895 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
1708896 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
1708897 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
1708898 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
1708899 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
1708900 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency

1708902 gary is the victim of dented pride for showing how insecure the us computer systems are
1708903 if he can hack into them what price any other hostile government can also the us should be pleased that flaws in their systems have been shown up and employ
1708904 i dont think that the us should be using gary as a scapegoat to cover their own inadequacies and slack attitude to security
1708905 the probable reality is that they will extradite gary take him to a classified location
1708906 if theres nothing to worry about why not come to the us where you will face a trial

1708947 we need an open and inclusive conversation to discuss our future one in which all the positive options are included the current devolution settlement more powers independence and also a form of federalism
1708948 scotland sooner rather than later is entitled to have the right to choose our constitutional future
1708949 that is a guiding principle for the debate on scotlands future a national conversation involving all the people of scotland
1708950 and it is the words of thomas jefferson that will inspire us we are a people capable of self government and worthy of it
1708951 when the proponents of devolution argued that the tories had no moral mandate running scotland in the early 1990s when they only had 11 seats just imagine what it will be like once the tories win at westminster with barely any scottish representation
1708952 alex salmond will claim that they have no real democratic legitimacy to run scotland we could then see a seismic shift in public opinion
1708953 we should not frighten or bribe scotland into maintaining the union we should not treat the electorate as children
1708954 scotland and england would survive perfectly well apart not that i advocate that policy
1708955 languages around the world are simply disappearing not being used anymore
1708956 norwegian is under entirely new pressure than it was just a few years ago especially because of the development of the internet and the media
1708957 it will represent an attempt to create a new language policy that we havent had in the country before
1708958 in the 1900s a declaration on language involved issues of how it was written now it involves how the language shall survive
1708959 think about it from this perspective an officer is hired for 200 and the bar gets the officer but the city has the liability if the officer is sued or if the officer is injured
1708960 there is much more liability for the city than there is on the bar owner
1708961 we looked at the data and what was taking place and we knew we had to make a decision
1708962 the decision behind the two police officers working the bar details together was for officer safety first and foremost
1708963 i cost this bar 1 25th more than previously citizen
1708964 i felt we were completely vulnerable in terms of bar details because of lack of supervision
1708965 this policy will now allow us to address our supervision and police officer safety
1708966 these acts were taking place against the kids behind closed doors and nobody witnessed anything or knew anything

1708975 hail up to an inch in diameter was reported all across town
1708976 i woke up and could hear hail pelting the roof
1708977 and the power lines had blown off the poles and were lying on the ground in front of our house and west as far as i could see
1708978 i looked out of the window from the headquarters of the centennial commission and saw the rain blowing parallel to the ground
1708979 all i could see was rain there was so much wind i could hardly open the back door of my station from the inside
1708980 blue balls of electricity about the size of my fist were shooting out from the power pole some were rolling all the way to the ground and across my side parking lot
1708981 all you could see out the window besides rain were flashes of electricity from the pole and these blue balls coming toward us one rolled all the way past the side of the diner
1708982 i got everybody my kids and my staff inside and down behind the counter
1708983 then it really began to blow i felt the house sway and for a moment there
1708984 then i went to the stairs to see what was going on upstairs and saw a piece of the roof had blown upward and water was coming in like a creek weve got water damage in five rooms
1708985 the trees on the west side were just twisting we went from window to window to see what would be blown away if that wind wasnt over 80 miles an hour ive never seen wind
1708986 even while the rain was blinding my front window i could see sun to the west

1708991 as technology continues to advance we begin to rely upon it more and more

1709080 da filmemacher trickfilme f r ein breites publikum machen ist f r viele immer noch ein neuer gedanke
1709081 wir erleben dabei momentan aber gro e ver nderungen mit wall e und kung fu panda zuschauer aller altersgruppen sehen sich diese filme an erwachsene genauso wie kinder und ich glaube da krieg der sterne seit jeher ein teil dieses allgemeininteresses war
1709082 es ist schwer damit aufzuh ren es macht s chtig auch die fans nat rlich aber f r mich ist es noch schlimmer als f r die meisten anderen
1709083 i checked the web page of the directorate general of passports to get information on how to obtain an iqama for my husband i found none i went to the ministry of interior in jeddah to inquire
1709084 the justice ministry does not have any information about the report originally published in a uae newspaper about the arrest of a saudi judge by dubai police
1709085 no such news reached the ministry of justice our judges are known for their integrity
1709086 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
1709087 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
1709088 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
1709089 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
1709090 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
1709091 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
1709092 when the dust clears my good name and reputation will also be cleared
1709093 as the questions become more pointed the lines keep coming
1709094 he uses jocularity as a weapon and defends himself not with direct answers but by attacking the questions logic
1709095 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
1709096 as a great admirer of the royal family i was disgusted to see that two of the animals in

1709100 paolo vi n incerto n triste al contrario fu gentile e forte
1709101 seguo con profonda simpatia questo grande incontro sportivo il pi importante ed atteso a livello mondiale aveva detto il papa allangelus a bressanone ed auspico vivamente che esso offra alla comunit internazionale un valido esempio di convivenza tra persone delle pi diverse provenienze nel rispetto della comune dignit possa ancora una volta lo sport essere segno di fraternit e di pace tra i popoli
1709102 offre con discrezione il proprio contributo nella promozione e nella difesa della persona umana dei suoi valori della sua spiritualit e della sua vocazione trascendente alla chiesa stanno particolarmente a cuore valori e obiettivi che sono di primaria importanza anche per la cina moderna la solidariet la pace la giustizia sociale il governo intelligente del fenomeno della globalizzazione
1709103 anche in cina scrive papa benedetto la chiesa chiamata a essere testimone di cristo a guardare in avanti con speranza e a misurarsi nellannuncio del vangelo con le nuove sfide che il popolo cinese deve affrontare
1709104 annunciare il vangelo significa annunciare e testimoniare ges cristo crocifisso e risorto luomo nuovo egli permette agli esseri umani di entrare in una nuova dimensione dove la misericordia e lamore rivolto anche al nemico testimoniano la vittoria della croce su ogni debolezza e miseria umana
1709105 il vostro cammino di riconciliazione dice il papa ai cinesi sostenuto dallesempio e dalla preghiera di tanti testimoni della fede che hanno sofferto e hanno perdonato offrendo la loro vita per lavvenire della chiesa cattolica in cina
1709106 mi credete scriveva in valle se vi dico che la cina non pi brutta della bella badia
1709107 il maggior flagello per noi e per i poveri cinesi cominciano a essere tanti europei senza fede e corrotti che adesso cominciano a inondare tutta la cina sono bens cristiani ma sono peggiori dei pagani non si curano daltro che di far denaro e di andare dietro a tutti i piaceri mondani se leuropa fosse veramente cattolica non dubito che sarebbe arrivato il tempo della conversione della cina ma purtroppo si deve guardare al futuro con timore e tremore non c tempo da perdere e non ci si pu risparmiare

1709117 paolo vi n incerto n triste al contrario fu gentile e forte
1709118 questo quello che io vi posso dire non una risposta infallibile le risposte dobbiamo cercarle anche insieme nella chiesa con i vescovi e qualcosa che nasce da una ricerca della comunit della chiesa e non solo dalla mia risposta
1709119 una volta ero pi severo poi lesempio di cristo mi ha fatto diventare pi accogliente nei casi in cui magari non ci sia una fede proprio matura o solida ma ci sia anche un barlume di ricerca di desiderio di comunione con la chiesa si pu essere anche pi larghi o generosi nellamministrazione dei sacramenti
1709120 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1709121 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1709122 every car on the road in the u s powered by hydrogen produced from clean sources of energy by the end of 2020
1709123 commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1709124 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
1709125 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
1709126 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
1709127 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
1709128 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
1709129 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
1709130 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
1709131 real results by the end of my first term in office
1709132 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1709133 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
1709134 to cut taxes on the things we want and tax things we should use less off
1709135 certainly there are many people who would sign a petition which would allow someone access to a ballot which is part of our democratic process
1709136 without him on the ballot al gore would have been president
1709137 its time for the next generation exemplified in every way by democratic presidential candidate barack obama
1709138 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
1709139 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster
1709140 on the low end 30 mph wind could generate about 500 watts
1709141 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
1709142 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
1709143 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
1709144 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
1709145 if you are either obama or mccain you want to get over the 50 percent line with women
1709146 although women credited hillary with clearing the path for future aspirants theyre much less certain it will be her or when that will be
1709147 many of these women intuit that whoever wins this election will be a one termer but it may also be a function of the feeling that hope springs eternal
1709148 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
1709149 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
1709150 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
1709151 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
1709152 simplexity why simple things become complex and how complex things can be made simple
1709153 the stakes could not be higher everything hinges on stopping coal
1709154 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1709155 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
1709156 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
1709157 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
1709158 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1709159 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1709160 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1709161 we were not as clear as we might have been
1709162 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
1709163 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
1709164 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
1709165 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information

1709169 paolo vi n incerto n triste al contrario fu gentile e forte
1709170 fu chiamato dalla provvidenza divina a guidare la barca di pietro in un periodo storico segnato da non poche sfide e problematiche
1709171 lardore missionario che lo spinse ad intraprendere impegnativi viaggi apostolici anche verso nazioni lontane a compiere gesti profetici di alta valenza ecclesiale missionaria ed ecumenica
1709172 alla chiesa che la via della sua missione di ricalcare le orme di cristo
1709173 in effetti il segreto dellazione pastorale che paolo vi svolse con instancabile dedizione adottando talora decisioni difficili e impopolari sta proprio nel suo amore per cristo amore che vibra con espressioni toccanti in tutti i suoi insegnamenti il suo animo di pastore era tutto preso da una tensione missionaria alimentata da sincero desiderio di dialogo con lumanit il suo invito profetico pi volte riproposto a rinnovare il mondo travagliato da inquietudini e violenze mediante la civilt dellamore nasceva da un totale suo affidamento a ges redentore delluomo
1709174 se infatti fu giovanni xxiii a indirlo e a iniziarlo tocc a lui suo successore portarlo a compimento con mano esperta delicata e ferma non meno arduo fu per papa montini reggere la chiesa nel periodo post conciliare non si lasci condizionare da incomprensioni e critiche anche se dovette sopportare sofferenze e attacchi talora violenti ma rest in ogni circostanza fermo e prudente timoniere della barca di pietro
1709175 con il passare degli anni afferma benedetto xvi appare sempre pi evidente limportanza per la chiesa e per il mondo
1709176 da un lato la vita cristiana quale la chiesa difende e promuove deve continuamente e strenuamente guardarsi da quanto pu illuderla profanarla soffocarla quasi cercasse di immunizzarsi dal contagio dellerrore e del male dallaltro lato la vita cristiana deve non solo adattarsi alle forme di pensiero e di costume che lambiente temporale le offre e le impone quando siano compatibili con le esigenze essenziali del suo programma religioso e morale ma deve cercare di avvicinarle di purificarle di nobilitarle di vivificarle di santificarle
1709177 chi ha compreso qualche cosa della vita cristiana non pu prescindere da una sua costante aspirazione di rinnovamento quelli che attribuiscono alla vita cristiana un carattere di stabilit di fedelt di staticit vedono giusto ma non vedono tutto certamente la vita cristiana ancorata a fatti e a impegni che non ammettono mutamenti come la rigenerazione battesimale la fede lappartenenza alla chiesa lanimazione della carit di natura sua unacquisizione permanente e da non compromettere mai ma come diciamo una vita e perci un principio un seme che deve svilupparsi che esige accrescimento perfezionamento e data la nostra naturale caducit e date certe inguaribili conseguenze del peccato originale esige riparazione rifacimento rinnovamento

1709188 the principle that relates these three points is anytime you do something beneficial for one of them you will almost inevitably also do something beneficial for the other two whether youre hoping to or not
1709189 nothing is more graceful than habitual cheerfulness which is always founded upon a peculiar relish for all the little pleasures which common occurrences afford we readily sympathize with it it inspires us with the same joy

1709204 redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of 1 to 2 brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
1709205 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
1709206 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
1709207 nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings
1709208 he would return the country to the more traditional foreign policy efforts of past presidents such as george h
1709209 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like
1709210 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
1709211 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
1709212 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
1709213 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
1709214 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1709215 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1709216 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1709217 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1709218 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1709219 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1709220 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1709221 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1709222 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1709223 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1709224 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1709225 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1709226 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1709227 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1709228 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1709229 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1709230 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1709231 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1709232 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1709233 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1709234 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1709235 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1709236 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1709237 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1709238 these incidents occurred after dark so the victims did not get a clear look at what this man was using to threaten them with
1709239 but we are concerned he may have been carrying a knife and we need to find him
1709240 we are aware that there were several motorists who may have seen the collision and not stopped and spoken to police
1709241 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1709242 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1709243 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1709244 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1709245 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1709246 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1709247 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1709248 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1709249 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1709250 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1709251 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1709252 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1709253 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1709254 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1709255 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1709256 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1709257 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1709258 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1709259 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1709260 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1709261 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1709262 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1709263 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1709264 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1709265 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1709266 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1709267 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1709268 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1709269 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1709270 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1709271 sabe se como uma massagem come a mas nunca como acaba
1709272 tata steels revenue for fiscal year end march 31 2008 released by the company after the global 500 publication deadline was 32 8 billion had the information been available the company would have placed 231 on the list the company ranked 315th in the listing based on revenue for the four quarters ended dec 31 2007 of 25 7 billion
1709273 taking a cue from falling crude prices gold prices may fall from the present rs 12 025 per 10 grams to touch rs 11 400 per 10 grams by this month end
1709274 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1709275 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1709276 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1709277 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1709278 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1709279 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1709280 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1709281 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1709282 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1709283 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1709284 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1709285 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1709286 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1709287 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1709288 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1709289 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1709290 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1709291 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1709292 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1709293 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1709294 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1709295 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1709296 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1709297 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1709298 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1709299 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1709300 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1709301 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1709302 if everything is so good for barack obama why isnt everything so good for barack obama
1709303 whats remarkable this summer is the stability of this race
1709304 in a broad sense it is similar to previous elections
1709305 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1709306 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1709307 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1709308 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1709309 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1709310 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1709311 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1709312 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1709313 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1709314 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1709315 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1709316 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1709317 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1709318 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1709319 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1709320 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
1709321 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
1709322 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
1709323 if this was a popularity contest kenny would be f ked but its not a popularity contest its a fight so therefore roger is f ked i love roger hes a great guy but every time i see roger he kind of gives me that wink like he knows something i dont he doesnt realize the jokes on him ive never seen kenny so hungry
1709324 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1709325 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1709326 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
1709327 after my injury with my chest i didnt know if i was able to come back in time i did which was great
1709328 i would love to have him here but im really excited with the guys on the team excited to compete with them and see what we can do
1709329 if he had another month hed be 100 percent on the team
1709330 at certain times i would try to motivate him and he really did an amazing job to get back to where he did he really pushed hard
1709331 he asked a lot of times what my opinion was of his status he had enough time to be ok but not enough time to be great
1709332 his use was inadvertent he was cleared by the federation and cleared by the international federation
1709333 we believe its perfectly appropriate that hes here participating we dont believe that he gained any unfair competitive advantage through his inadvertent use of the substance in question
1709334 i told him id love to have you here get on a plane
1709335 he is at the point of finishing up the sport while i am at the peak of gymnastics at the olympics

1709370 using the inflated carcont storage charges as a pretext defendant hitrinov then offered to acquire plaintiffs inventory for the combined sum of 20 000
1709371 wanted to show that girls were not tough enough to play football
1709372 this had the effect of locating certain aspects of team camaraderie in a place that was inaccessible to plaintiff elborough

1709380 unless there is a radical transformation of existing business processes well in advance of any collaborative programme then a project is doomed to failure before it has even started collaboration introduces an entirely new way of working and this has a direct impact on the way people work how they interact with it and how they are trained businesses need to understand all these facets before undertaking a project of this nature user buy in is an absolute pre requisite to success
1709381 it policies also need to be reviewed this must encompass issues such as the appropriate use of email and instant messaging technologies as well as ensuring that the organisation has the capability to archive and monitor all communications
1709382 collaborative solutions should in fact eradicate the need for this sort of communications technology as everything can be captured on the collaboration platform which in turn will support many aups
1709383 collaborative solutions enable individuals and groups to interact in real time and keep a record of whatever they discuss and agree to do increased levels of communication and co operation between your employees partners and customers drives any organisation towards an anytime anywhere culture that delivers tangible business benefits
1709384 start with one technology area and then expand to others alternatively start with one business process and then add in others applying the collaborative technology as and when you assess the success of the initial projects the third option is to start with one business unit or group before large scale roll out
1709385 critical to this however is user acceptance and that will mean the radical transformation of traditional mindsets in a number of business areas not least human resources and the way employees interact the answer be prepared
1709386 the island has proved to be a great success with hundreds of visitors looking at the memorials to ordinary people the military personnel lost in the gulf and afghanistan and celebrities alike the staging of tribute concerts is a natural progression but letting the artists celebrate their heroes the people whove inspired them is a great way of keeping the island alive and interactive something thats a big part of the ethos behind second life

1709398 tomorrow you will take your role with us in our operation to attack al qaeda militants
1709399 we intentionally allowed them the militants to flee in order to create a gap between their leaders and followers from the chaos
1709400 when they get back again they will find no ground for them to work as we will have changed the area with this operation
1709401 when a person is arrested he has to be produced before a committee of judges at al jawal an iraqi army camp near baquba
1709402 we found them very polite and well mannered they politely asked us to get in the house we are greatly surprised and very impressed
1709403 i thought they could not do that to you there must be a mistake you would think the military department would be the ones to protect you from things like that
1709404 someones at war you dont fire them you dont lay them off
1709405 cmon especially an organization that has so many places to put him
1709406 when someone comes home we should lay out the red carpet him
1709407 i am not trying to think about that i am just trying to think about improving as a player and doing everything the right way and as good as i can
1709408 if that takes me to the roster that is where i will be if it doesnt i will be somewhere else
1709409 two closed up and cal poly was the choice i went with
1709410 during my junior year they started watching me and talking to me and i was thinking maybe i can make this maybe i can do this
1709411 his mother and i both have expectations for our kids and football had nothing to do with that the real power of any individual is knowledge
1709412 sometimes it goes into kids heads and sometimes it doesnt
1709413 courtney is one of those guys who picks it up right away he doesnt look like hes paying much attention but he is into to every word you are saying he is a bright kid
1709414 he wanted to make sure they didnt let football consume them
1709415 most of the other coaches go to the opposite direction they couldnt care less if you go to class or not all they want to do is excel in football keep a job and put the school on the map
1709416 courtney is kind of up and down a little bit right now because hes a young player who has changed positions
1709417 but you saw that play in the end zone thats the kind of play he can make the thing we dont know yet is whether he can tackle on a consistent basis inside
1709418 i jokingly said to him why dont you let cowboys owner jerry jones know that is your expertise
1709419 he might let you help them with their new stadium being built
1709420 remembering back to the last time this occurred theres something a little disturbing about 200 000 germans chanting their support for a charismatic leader in the streets of berlin
1709421 what i really meant by saying the surge wouldnt work
1709422 we like mr obama and we hope that he will win the election
1709423 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1709424 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1709425 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1709426 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1709427 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1709428 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1709429 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1709430 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1709431 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1709432 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1709433 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1709434 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1709435 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1709436 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1709437 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1709438 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1709439 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1709440 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1709441 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1709442 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1709443 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1709444 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
1709445 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
1709446 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
1709447 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
1709448 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1709449 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1709450 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1709451 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1709452 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
1709453 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1709454 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
1709455 evolve as services and conversation channels emerge fuse and dissipate
1709456 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1709457 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1709458 its our torch and its in beijing its a chance of a hundred years and its finally here
1709459 i feel the olympics will help china develop because china used to be so closed and it gives an opportunity for the whole world to see china

1709463 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
1709464 i made a few bad pitches and would like to have one back the grand slam
1709465 policy perspectives how the democrats and republicans view foreign affairs
1709466 debate besides being a sign of health in a party is important to any democracy
1709467 the republican party only cares about winning the war militarily which isnt enough we need to win culturally as well we need to win the war and win the peace the republicans have won the war but lost the peace
1709468 the world is split between those who oppose terror and those who appease it
1709469 the terrorists have declared war on the civilized world but well declare victory
1709470 could you shlep this bag up to my room please
1709471 corruption runs rampant as prison rights attorney teresa lagos dolores heredia fights for a humane rehabilitation program while corporate shill federico marquez juan manuel bernal schemes to privatize the prison and use the women as cheap manual labor
1709472 why ac whom i love has this cache i do not know
1709473 having golf an olympic sport is exponentially more important to the game of golf than the majors
1709474 the reason for that is it would bring in 168 different countries and their olympic foundation and all those revenues and that would be going toward the growth of the game
1709475 the majors are incredibly big as we know but we still capture the same audience that is already interested in the game
1709476 its for growing the game around the world and something we can all do together
1709477 the value for the players is that the more people that play around the world the more people will be watching theyll be paid back eventually
1709478 i want to watch the olympic sports where basically professionals arent playing
1709479 where that is the absolute pinnacle of their career and they had to wait four years for this one moment and they go out and they perform break a world record win a gold medal and they were able to perform on the spot
1709480 im not competing until next year so ive got another five months to kill
1709481 this one is more frustrating because im the two time defending champion
1709482 walked right back into the flames and rescued one of the wounded marines
1709483 if his conviction stands the enron prosecutions were a success if it doesnt prosecutors will have a hard time convincing the public that they took the right approach
1709484 but its clear that the law is evolving in this area
1709485 whenever a court rules as the 5th circuit did regarding this issue we listen to that ruling
1709486 to be clear we vigorously oppose the defendants every accusation of prosecutorial misconduct
1709487 the bush team knew that if it failed to move aggressively on enron there would be a huge political price to pay
1709488 convictions a prosecutors battle against mafia killers drug kingpins and enron thieves
1709489 the enron business records were so voluminous and hard to decode we thought it could take years to determine what evidence was relevant
1709490 it would take the six of us more than a decade
1709491 we tried as hard as we could to do a thoughtful and conscientious job in a very difficult case
1709492 should not be read to suggest that no dishonest fraudulent wrongful or criminal act has occurred
1709493 the book is not finished as many of these issues continue to work their way through the courts
1709494 theyre trying to avoid being attacked for what some may call the excesses of the enron and other earlier corporate fraud matters
1709495 the government was very aggressive and they may have gone too far in their prosecution theories
1709496 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1709497 it is striking the difference of perspective between the united states and many other countries
1709498 i think because of the politics around immigration more broadly the fact that mr medellin is mexican rather than swedish does make a difference
1709499 it certainly does play into a bigger debate and bigger fears that many people have about immigration from mexico
1709500 get up and put your hands together like the way you pray
1709501 a feeling that im being remembered you can imagine well no you probably cant imagine but it was a feeling that somebody knows im here
1709502 you know you have grounds for a residency petition here
1709503 what kind of sick person would tell you that shed spent three months in jail to get excused from her grades
1709504 you dont know what youre talking about unless youve been in a situation like the one ive been in
1709505 certain basic rights guaranteed under international law these include the right to humane treatment as well as rights which are essential to protection from arbitrary detention
1709506 needed to learn a thing or two about respecting others
1709507 you are a fucking asshole and you will always be a fucking asshole
1709508 damn you i meant rip way too many albums i rip
1709509 i think they want to keep it very simple or
1709510 ps2 i just remembered this girl i used to hang
1709511 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team
1709512 we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world
1709513 falling vehicle prices and the negative equity it is creating continues to pressure sales trends
1709514 unfortunately for carmax we dont see any reason for a quick turnaround in those trends

1709562 officially barack obama will deliver an energy policy speech wednesday to citizens in elkhart ind but the focus of the political chattering class will be on the man sitting shotgun at the event evan bayh the indiana senator thought to be on the likely democratic presidential nominees short list of vice presidential candidates

1709576 there is research that shows bluetooth devices may be as harmful as the cellphone itself you now have a microwave transmitter living in your ear right next to your brain while the power level may be lower from the bluetooth it is constantly transmitting its like sticking your head into the microwave oven but hoping its ok because you are setting the power level low

1709582 from what ive been told from the hotel the public security bureau showed up at midnight and told them our specific event had to be canceled for safety reasons without going into any specifics
1709583 when i arrived at 8 a m there were public security officials in the press conference room we had booked

1709585 it was a sexy ad really designed for the u s market it was positive and it was supposed to be done in a private function room
1709586 im surprised they were so concerned given weve done similar with asian celebrities in the past
1709587 whoever this individual is and we know for sure its not clark rockefeller hes a very sophisticated scheming lying individual
1709588 hes been getting away with this apparently for many many years
1709589 its going to be difficult its been disconcerting not to know exactly who he is but weve been confronted with situations like this in boston in the past and weve never failed to identify the person we have in custody
1709590 were confident that eventually and its going to take some time were going to find out exactly who he is
1709591 she had suspicions shortly after they married in 1993 that he wasnt who he said he was and ultimately if you look at the divorce proceedings and documents that was a big issue in the case
1709592 she had some suspicions early on and she has been cooperative with law enforcement
1709593 steve hrones is an excellent criminal defense attorney in boston with a good reputation but i think hes wrong on this case
1709594 we have a statute that specifically addresses this type of situation this defendant was under a court order to have three or four supervised visits a year he broke that court order he abducted his child with no authority
1709595 he set off a massive law enforcement response in boston that was extremely costly
1709596 he assaulted a social worker his daughter was injured he took her off the ground and threw her into the vehicle she was injured this was a violent episode he needs to be held accountable
1709597 i wouldnt want california authorities quite candidly commenting on a pending investigation that i had in boston
1709598 so im going to give them the same courtesy i can only tell you that were working in cooperation with law enforcement in other states in other parts of the country trying to identify exactly who he is and to determine whether he is responsible for any other crime
1709599 i was without e mail from july 18 to july 28
1709600 the day we launched mobileme we had a lot more traffic to our servers than we anticipated with the result that access to the web versions of the mobileme applications was temporarily unavailable
1709601 weve since added server capacity and tuned our software to scale better i e behave more gracefully when traffic spikes
1709602 we particularly regret to report the loss in the affected accounts of approximately 10 percent of the messages received between july 16 and july 18
1709603 if you dont think cloud computing through theres certainly plenty of things that can go wrong
1709604 the applications had to be ready by that date whether they were ready or not
1709605 thats probably the biggest part of apples problems with mobileme
1709606 in july 1945 secretary of war stimson visiting my headquarters in germany informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on japan
1709607 during his recitation of the relevant facts i had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so i voiced to him my grave misgivings first on the basis of my belief that japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary and secondly because i thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was i thought no longer mandatory as a measure to save american lives
1709608 the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing
1709609 it is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at hiroshima and nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against japan the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons
1709610 the lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening my own feeling was that in being the first to use it we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the dark ages i was not taught to make war in that fashion and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children
1709611 i am convinced that if you as president will make a shortwave broadcast to the people of japan tell them they can have their emperor if they surrender that it will not mean unconditional surrender except for the militarists youll get a peace in japan youll have both wars over
1709612 the use of the atomic bomb with its indiscriminate killing of women and children revolts my soul
1709613 the japanese were prepared to negotiate all the way from february 1945 up to and before the time the atomic bombs were dropped if such leads had been followed up there would have been no occasion to drop the atomic bombs
1709614 use of the bomb had besmirched americas reputation he hoover told friends it ought to have been described in graphic terms before being flung out into the sky over japan
1709615 i told macarthur of my memorandum of mid may 1945 to truman that peace could be had with japan by which our major objectives would be accomplished macarthur said that was correct and that we would have avoided all of the losses the atomic bomb and the entry of russia into manchuria
1709616 the potsdam declaration in july demand ed that japan surrender unconditionally or face prompt and utter destruction macarthur was appalled he knew that the japanese would never renounce their emperor and that without him an orderly transition to peace would be impossible anyhow because his people would never submit to allied occupation unless he ordered it ironically when the surrender did come it was conditional and the condition was a continuation of the imperial reign had the generals advice been followed the resort to atomic weapons at hiroshima and nagasaki might have been unnecessary
1709617 macarthurs views about the decision to drop the atomic bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki were starkly different from what the general public supposed
1709618 when i asked general macarthur about the decision to drop the bomb i was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted what i asked would his advice have been he replied that he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb the war might have ended weeks earlier he said if the united states had agreed as it later did anyway to the retention of the institution of the emperor
1709619 in the light of available evidence i myself and others felt that if such a categorical statement about the retention of the dynasty had been issued in may 1945 the surrender minded elements in the japanese government might well have been afforded by such a statement a valid reason and the necessary strength to come to an early clearcut decision
1709620 if surrender could have been brought about in may 1945 or even in june or july before the entrance of soviet russia into the pacific war and the use of the atomic bomb the world would have been the gainer
1709621 i have always felt that if in our ultimatum to the japanese government issued from potsdam in july 1945 we had referred to the retention of the emperor as a constitutional monarch and had made some reference to the reasonable accessibility of raw materials to the future japanese government it would have been accepted indeed i believe that even in the form it was delivered there was some disposition on the part of the japanese to give it favorable consideration when the war was over i arrived at this conclusion after talking with a number of japanese officials who had been closely associated with the decision of the then japanese government to reject the ultimatum as it was presented i believe we missed the opportunity of effecting a japanese surrender completely satisfactory to us without the necessity of dropping the bombs
1709622 following the three power july 1945 potsdam conference emissaries from this country could contact representatives from japan somewhere on the china coast and make representations with regard to russias position they were about to declare war on japan and at the same time give them some information regarding the proposed use of atomic power together with whatever assurances the president might care to make with regard to the retention of the emperor of japan and the treatment of the japanese nation following unconditional surrender
1709623 i dont see that we have anything in particular to lose in following such a program
1709624 the only way to find out is to try it out
1709625 it definitely seemed to me that the japanese were becoming weaker and weaker
1709626 i think that the japanese were ready for peace and they already had approached the russians and i think the swiss and that suggestion of giving a warning of the atomic bomb was a face saving proposition for them and one that they could have readily accepted
1709627 in my opinion the japanese war was really won before we ever used the atom bomb thus it wouldnt have been necessary for us to disclose our nuclear position and stimulate the russians to develop the same thing much more rapidly than they would have if we had not dropped the bomb
1709628 i proposed to secretary forrestal that the weapon should be demonstrated before it was used
1709629 it seemed to me that such a weapon was not necessary to bring the war to a successful conclusion that once used it would find its way into the armaments of the world
1709630 the plan i devised was essentially this japan was already isolated from the standpoint of ocean shipping
1709631 while i was working on the new plan of air attack i concluded that even without the atomic bomb japan was likely to surrender in a matter of months my own view was that japan would capitulate by november 1945
1709632 based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that certainly prior to 31 december 1945 and in all probability prior to 1 november 1945 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1709633 even without the attacks on hiroshima and nagasaki it seemed highly unlikely given what we found to have been the mood of the japanese government that a u s invasion of the islands scheduled for november 1 1945 would have been necessary
1709634 prof albert einstein said that he was sure that president roosevelt would have forbidden the atomic bombing of hiroshima had he been alive and that it was probably carried out to end the pacific war before russia could participate
1709635 as far as his own life was concerned one thing seemed quite clear
1709636 in the spring of 45 it was clear that the war against germany would soon end and so i began to ask myself what is the purpose of continuing the development of the bomb and how would the bomb be used if the war with japan has not ended by the time we have the first bombs
1709637 i thought that it would be a mistake to disclose the existence of the bomb to the world before the government had made up its mind about how to handle the situation after the war using the bomb certainly would disclose that the bomb existed
1709638 byrnes was concerned about russias postwar behavior russian troops had moved into hungary and rumania and byrnes thought it would be very difficult to persuade russia to withdraw her troops from these countries that russia might be more manageable if impressed by american military might and that a demonstration of the bomb might impress russia
1709639 i was concerned at this point that by demonstrating the bomb and using it in the war against japan we might start an atomic arms race between america and russia which might end with the destruction of both countries
1709640 i told oppenheimer that i thought it would be a very serious mistake to use the bomb against the cities of japan oppenheimer didnt share my view
1709641 well said oppenheimer dont you think that if we tell the russians what we intend to do and then use the bomb in japan the russians will understand it theyll understand it only too well szilard replied no doubt with byrness intentions in mind
1709642 ligne de jeux apprentis dieux deviens un dieu et faits ce quil te pla t
1709643 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1709644 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1709645 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1709646 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1709647 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1709648 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1709649 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1709650 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1709651 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1709652 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1709653 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1709654 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1709655 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1709656 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1709657 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1709658 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1709659 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1709660 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1709661 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1709662 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1709663 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1709664 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1709665 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1709666 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1709667 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1709668 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1709669 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1709670 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1709671 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1709672 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1709673 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1709674 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1709675 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1709676 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1709677 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1709678 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1709679 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1709680 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1709681 if we dont get our way we will bomb you

1709712 he cannot and will not support legislation that raises taxes
1709713 more likely to enrich oil companies than to lower gas prices for american consumers
1709714 i think the problem with mccains position is that he keeps saying im in support for all of the above but when it comes down to specifics in what he will really support the only thing that comes through loud and clear is more drilling and i think that is the big vulnerability on his part
1709715 the tax the oil company issue is really difficult for republicans but the polling data indicates that the public thinks the oil companies have big role to play i dont know what is really going on here or if mccain is thinking this through carefully but i think this is undermining his credibility and to some degree is his hallmark approach looking for bipartisan solutions to problems
1709716 in the end he might have to do exactly what obama has done join the compromise while saying he objects sternly to the taxes but even then he risks getting killed by his conservative base
1709717 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1709718 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1709719 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1709720 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1709721 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1709722 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1709723 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1709724 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1709725 we know that microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions
1709726 the story possibly could turn out to be the same for mars we dont know yet
1709727 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1709728 perchlorate is not a particularly nice thing to find in the soil
1709729 no one hunting for life would be happy to see it in any sort of abundance
1709730 it is not a molecule of choice for most life
1709731 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1709732 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1709733 to exercise extreme caution to assure their safety they should remain at home or where they are for the rest of the day
1709734 we were on second ring road in heavy traffic and he said hed pull over right there and drop me on the shoulder
1709735 are you a starter of all and finisher of none
1709736 whats important is whatever changes you make to your routine need to be small enough so that there is a minimal amount of difference between what youve been doing and what you now do
1709737 i will be your congresswoman until i decide to retire
1709738 i am honored blessed and will continue to serve you to the very best of my abilities
1709739 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1709740 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1709741 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1709742 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1709743 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1709744 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1709745 you know its not about you its about your country
1709746 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1709747 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1709748 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1709749 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1709750 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1709751 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1709752 in the short term nevirapine is better than nothing but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardise future treatment for mothers and infants
1709753 in genetically identical twin pairs the twin who exercised more did not display fewer anxious and depressive symptoms than the c0 twin who exercised less

1709755 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1709756 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1709757 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1709758 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious advocates
1709759 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1709760 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1709761 as near as we can tell there are only a handful of people crossing the picket line and most of those are management and nonbargainers who are required to go to work
1709762 they gave us their last and final offer an we said its not good enough right now they are not building airplanes
1709763 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv
1709764 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
1709765 another look at rpgs this time from an isometric view
1709766 when your best customers ask you to design new products you have to listen
1709767 many of my customers wanted distinctive jewelry appropriate for work an evening out and other less formal occasions
1709768 i love my new line of jewelry adding different elements to my designs has created exciting challenges that allow me to explore new directions im never sure what the new piece im working on will look like when im done thats what makes it so much fun
1709769 i could not possibly wear all of the jewelry i want to make so the only solution was to launch a business and offer my creations to the public once i made that decision there was no stopping me
1709770 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1709771 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1709772 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1709773 if you could shout this psalm from anywhere in the world where would that be
1709774 girls can you believe this gone are the days when 4 girls would go to dinner and just talk about getting their hair and nails done which are important no doubt but here we are balling our eyes out and talking about global issues and the heart of god to see justice on the earth
1709775 had we won we would have had a great chance of snatching the title because we play lincolnshire in the last game but the rain never looked like relenting
1709776 it seems to have been following us around for the last two years
1709777 this brand of cricket is a perfect fit for the olympic schedule
1709778 as a cricketer it would be great to think you could achieve an olympic gold medal in your career everybody who plays elite sport dreams of olympic gold
1709779 importantly it would give a greater ability for the olympic movement to tap into enthusiasm of the 1 5 billion population of the asian sub continent that love cricket
1709780 i have reason to know the kids who were involved the families who were involved and ive never known them to harbor this type of feeling
1709781 began a pattern of consistently harassing sexually harassing demeaning threatening and retaliatory conduct in conspiracy with superintendent valmadge towner
1709782 the application of nansulate high heat at deba had started when the technical data for epx 4 was released several months ago dr vedat president of kolorgen ltd requested that we postpone shipment of the balance of the 10 containers of nansulate high heat he had ordered for the deba textile plant project while he discussed the performance qualities of the new epx 4 product with his customer in particular the faster cure time
1709783 subsequently dr vedat requested that we send him 300 gallons of epx 4 by expedited air freight and indicated that he will be providing a new delivery schedule for the sea containers of the epx 4 product the faster cure time of the epx 4 product will allow them to complete the application ahead of schedule for this major project and the chemical and fire resistant qualities are an added valuable benefit to deba
1709784 hmm i wonder why my hair grows back slow at times and faster at other times
1709785 you are the christ the son of the living god
1709786 for the son of man is to come with his angels in the glory of his father and then he will repay every man for what he has done truly i say to you there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom
1709787 his face shone like the sun and his garments became white as light
1709788 his appearance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow
1709789 if the humanly manufactured and humble cloth of jesus garments could in a certain sense take on the nature of light communicated to it by the touch of jesus body what are we to say of the souls of all human beings disposed to receive the light of divine glory
1709790 this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased listen to him
1709791 the great fear and prostration of the disciples at beholding jesus splendor and hearing the fathers voice may surprise us moderns more accustomed to speaking to and about the most high with an ease and matter of factness that betray either profound ignorance or fundamental insolence in the face of gods holiness and transcendence peter james and john here know that the holy god has come close to them and therefore they instinctively react like wax melting before the approach of living fire this shows the depth of their spiritual awareness awareness both of who they are and of who god is
1709792 the court finds the memorial at mt soledad including its latin cross communicates the primarily non religious messages of military service death and sacrifice
1709793 this is a wonderful victory not only for the families of majors martino and bloomfield who can have some comfort knowing that the memories of their loved ones are preserved under the cross but for all americans who care about our young men and women who have sacrificed their lives in defense of our country sadly i fully expect the aclu attorneys to appeal this decision to the ninth circuit court of appeals so this fight is not over
1709794 mount soledad becomes a place to reflect on our past be inspired by true patriots and offer war veterans our heartfelt gratitude for the freedom we all enjoy today
1709795 k s a 65 6703 survives all of the constitutional challenges
1709796 we have just one thing to say to tiller today and that is see you in court
1709797 todays ruling by judge owens vindicates our efforts to bring tiller to justice all along we knew that it wasnt the law that was faulty but it was tillers interpretation of the law that was faulty this gives us a glimmer of hope that we could eventually see some shred of justice
1709798 these agents were just doing their job the problems began when the known drug smuggler who was also an illegal alien brought 743 pounds of marijuana into the united states not when ramos and compean shot at him
1709799 this is the most ridiculous application of the law our government has ever perpetuated against anyone who is in law enforcement this decision means any law enforcement agent can be convicted for firing his weapon in what the attorney general says is a crime whether the agents committed a crime is apparently of absolutely no consequence
1709800 this decision may also mean that we will have a great deal of difficultly in getting qualified people to fill the position of law enforcement agents because they can be wrongly convicted and given prison sentences
1709801 why we choose to believe an illegal alien who is a known drug smuggler instead of two well thought of border agents is a question that is truly beyond my comprehension this decision is truly about attorneys playing mental games and twisting the facts in order to get a conviction
1709802 terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
1709803 the county of fresno and the public guardian are to be applauded for immediately recognizing the rights of the family to care for their loved one and taking the steps to allow that process to be accomplished quickly and without delay the court from the earliest stages of this proceeding proffered rulings of wisdom and gave substance and value to janet riveras life the sanctity of life was honored and we thank the lord for the wonderful outcome in this case
1709804 when ms emrich contacted us on july 21st brian was quick to take this on we are very pleased that the family will be allowed to care for ms rivera and that public officials listened to ms riveras family
1709805 we have now taken additional security measures including encrypting the data which we should have done from the beginning
1709806 there was hesitation seeing the initial outlay the bulk of the money to put the solar panels on the roof

1709809 ashwell has shown in this series that hes a match winner and the fact that hes already in england with his family added to the attraction of signing him
1709810 hes in form and its always good to sign a player who is playing with confidence hell join us at a vital stage of the season and add quality to our middle order
1709811 hes an excellent fielder and he isnt involved in south africas one day dixtures so he fits the bill for perfectly
1709812 notts are in contention for silverware and im confident that i can add some experience to the team at an important stage of the season
1709813 i know that i am joining a competitive team and i have kept my eye on the results ever since the interest was expressed
1709814 i spoke to stuart broad at headingley long before the deal was concluded and he told me that the set up was good and that trent bridge is a great place to play cricket
1709815 im not in the south africa one day squad which frees up my time and hopefully there will be an opportunity for me to play more county cricket in the future
1709816 real results by the end of my first term in office
1709817 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1709818 chose instead to put all of the children and their mother in harms way
1709819 neither crime scene showed any signs of forced entry yet in both unidentified fingerprints were found on unlocked sliding glass doors to the home
1709820 and perhaps most notably both victims were found with several items of household furniture stacked on top of their bodies

1709908 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
1709909 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
1709910 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country

1709926 what makes the arab muslim conquests so remarkable is the permanence of the effect they had on the language and the religion of the conquered lands
1709927 the forces that conquered iraq in the decade 632 640 seem to have been significantly smaller and the arabic sources quote between 6 000 and 12 000 men the numbers in egypt were smaller still amrs initial force was between 3 500 and 4 000 men though they were soon joined by 12 000 reinforcements
1709928 part of the explanation for the speed of the conquest lies in the political structure of egypt from pharoanic times the administration of the country was highly centralised in late antiquity defence was in the hands of the governor and his army most of the population had neither arms nor military training
1709929 conquest was the prelude to conversion by the year 1000 it is likely that the majority of the population in all the different areas that had been conquered by the 750 were muslim
1709930 the efforts they have made to provide good air quality during the olympics are marvelous
1709931 the ioc is confident that measures already put in place plus those planned by beijing organizers and city authorities will continue to improve the citys air quality leading up to and during the games
