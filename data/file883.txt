8830529 javon has the ability to make our offensive line look a whole lot better
8830530 riley is a little bit more mobile in the pocket so we have to contain him a little bit more in that respect but i dont see their offense really changing that much with him
8830531 its not like theyre going to all of a sudden go to an option attack because hes in there or a quarterback run type of thing as much as a matter of fact i was watching film and longshore was running the option on third and short down near the goal line and you would think the other guy would do that
8830532 this program has a very very rich tradition im very humbled to have that responsibility that goes along with it
8830533 it was obviously a game we would have liked to have won
8830534 we just look at our own situation what we need to get done and what we need to see then go from there
8830535 tonight had an impact on a lot of spots on the roster were going to sit down and talk about the roster after we take a long look at the tape
8830536 you just cant keep laying it on the ground its a tough thing
8830537 sometimes with a young back or any back you just have to show patience because the more they think about it sometimes the worse it gets
8830538 to surpass 56 000 season tickets certainly is a tremendous accomplishment and its one thats shared by both the team and the community
8830539 i was kind of worried about how hes going to make adjustments to the united states but he doesnt know the pitchers or who is throwing and doesnt care i think that helps him
8830540 most of the time when people say oh god we face josh beckett in two weeks i guarantee you a lot of people dont sleep you got me he doesnt care how hard he throws he just goes out there and swings the bat
8830541 it has been tough for me but ive been in baseball 18 years these streaks happen
8830542 ned asked me where are you and i told him i was in minnesota
8830543 id be out i would be taking a long nap
8830544 i think that it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please
8830545 bij het betreden van de boekhandel werd mijn oog getroffen door een verzameling felle scheelmakende kleuren
8830546 trying to be sexy and anti sexist at exactly the same time
8830547 to know peace man has to experience conflict he has to go through the heroic stage before he can act as a sage he has to be a victim of his passions before he can rise above them to arouse mans passionate nature to hand him over to the devil and put him to the supreme test there has to be a conflict involving something more than country political principles ideologies etc man in revolt against his own cloying nature that is real war and that is a bloodless war which goes on for ever under the peaceful name of evolution in this war man ranges himself once and for all on the side of the angels though he may as individual be defeated he can be certain of the outcome because the whole universe is with him
8830548 the strawberries are too expensive its true they dont have enough for dessert its true
8830549 i often surprise myself you cant plan some shots that go in not unless youre on marijuana and the only grass im partial to is wimbledons
8830550 a traditional fixture at wimbledon is the way the bbc tv commentary box fills up with british players eliminated in the early rounds
8830551 mixed doubles are always starting divorces if you play with your wife you fight with her if you play with somebody else she fights with you
8830552 tennis was a game invented by a woman named samantha tennis in 1839 in the village of lobsworth county of kent as a diversion for the wealthy and titled englishmen of the region who had nothing better to do at the time but drink belch and wear funny clothes
8830553 it is also a desperate act by the bn government that is still reeling from its repeated defeats and refusing to listen to the clear signals demonstrated by the rakyat time and again via the ballot box
8830554 the grounds given that malaysia today is a seditious website are completely baseless and unfounded in any principle of law given that there are ample laws which govern such activities and there has yet to be a single court in all of malaysia that has found the website to contain seditious content
8830555 pre emptive strikes such as these are weak and pathetic attempts to hide a desperation borne of absolute moral bankruptcy
8830556 pkr calls upon the mcmc and the government to keep its promise to the msc and to immediately revoke this order and resist any temptation to arrogantly show callous disregard for the right of malaysians to access alternative information
8830557 i will fight the government action all the way their action will not stop me from writing
8830558 its real its as real as its going to be man
8830559 you know our mind set is different we dont have a lot of stars here we have a lot of gritty dudes who are going to scrap and fight were ready man we have been sensing it we have been feeling it were ready to go out and do what we know we can do
8830560 when somebody turns on our tape they are going to go holy crap those guys are flying around
8830561 you go through the dog days and the lulls of training camp
8830562 we had some of that this year and you had practices that started slow but there was a competitiveness spirit

8830566 you cant let it affect you you put it behind you learn what you can and just move on
8830567 ive been waiting to play a game for a while
8830568 ive worked on a lot of things and want to show my improvement against cal
8830569 hes never gone into the huddle thinking he wasnt going to be able to make a play
8830570 i feel like hes ready to take the next step
8830571 he needs to be protected we need to run the right routes we need to get the ball in scoring opportunities for him
8830572 you dont want to put too much pressure on the quarterback
8830573 i felt pretty good for my second outing in almost a year
8830574 i could throw my off speed pitches i feel great hopefully everything will keep going well
8830575 not many good swings against for a guy who hasnt been out there for a while
8830576 i was very satisfied with the way he threw for a guy 11 months off surgery that was pretty good he had good angle on his breaking ball
8830577 for me you look not so much at the success as much as the swings against him there werent many good swings against him
8830578 ill be happy if i can make it to the big leagues this year but if not ill go home and rest and get ready for next year
8830579 they were one of the first teams that called and they were always calling my agent to see how i was doing
8830580 and well go and capture canada for weve nothing else to do
8830581 every other team on our schedule is a worthy talented opponent so we know every week is a fight for our lives but i think it helps our schedule
8830582 the more they learn about concussions theyll definitely be cautious with it safe and cautious
8830583 we have guys here who are sophomores and juniors who havent caught a lot of balls
8830584 so when you talk about freshmen coming in some of those guys have eight fewer catches than guys who have been here a year or two
8830585 what we have been able to see of him is that he is a really great athlete
8830586 hes got great feet and has the ability to make plays
8830587 after redshirting his freshman season tarrant played in seven games last season where he gained 94 yards on 12 carries
8830588 it is like at times they absolutely are thinking each others thoughts
8830589 if you would have told us four years ago that we could be the ncaa record holder for touchdowns by a duo i would have laughed at you
8830590 that just seems ridiculous it really has surprised me we just didnt think this is where wed be
8830591 we were completing so many passes that we were like hey coach maybe we should run this
8830592 right then i made some catches to where even i was saying wow and chase was throwing balls where he was thinking to himself wow from there the confidence started sinking in we saw that just playing scout team got us a closer bond
8830593 i know that when youre a young quarterback like clement was you tend to look for a particular guy a little bit more just like colt did early with us
8830594 i see that when i see clement scramble around he knows where to find his guy dillard
8830595 when we first got in the spread he was the only one i had thrown a lot of routes to so he was the only one i could really trust to know that hes going to be where i need him to be early on i knew who he was as a receiver and how he played so it was a lot easier for me to throw it to him and trust him
8830596 theyre a great example to people of when the underdogs come up and do something
8830597 for two guys from rice to come together and they can set the all time record thats something that i think will be a great inspiration to people in college and high school forever
8830598 we knew we had a better football team than a year ago and to see it come out with a win tonight really makes us feel good
8830599 its the kind of thing that will even bring our team tighter together
8830600 ive seen him in two games and theyve both been darn good
8830601 its a wonderful work environment and ive just been trying to prepare the best i could and hopefully its paid off
8830602 its great to be back on the field with these guys there is really nothing better in the world

8830629 im very satisfied with the teams performance and their success has sparked a lot of excitement and passion for football across the country football in india has also made a giant leap forward at club level also
8830630 ive had two very happy years with india during this period the team played 23 games and weve only lost three in the process we won the nehru cup in 2007 as well as the challenge cup
8830631 we have a relatively stable first eleven now quite a few young talents have broken into the senior side while the experienced players also have key roles to play
8830632 when i coached china in 1998 they had no overseas based players they simply didnt believe in themselves but after the teams encouraging results like the win over japan in the eaff championship some top players like fan zhiyi and sun jihai made high profile transfers to european clubs
8830633 we have a host of talented players like sunil chhetri who have the potential to earn a move to europe
8830634 we must make the indian people believe their players can make it

8830684 ive got him combing through every scrap of garbage in the city to try and get a lead on hollingsworth
8830685 so youre going to do what stay in france and let your sister con you some more
8830686 just goes to show you no ones invincible not even the great victor newman
8830687 theyve had everything handed to them their entire lives im not sharing with them
8830688 today is history and i want to share it with everyone
8830689 this is the capital of california and this is where i wanted to be tonight
8830690 im working hard to try and make ends meet america needs a change i feel it in my heart
8830691 but first and foremost i am here because this is history in the making
8830692 so its nice to be energized to see real people in real life not just on tv
8830693 a turning point for me in deciding to vote for him was when he said hell talk to our enemies as well as our friends
8830694 we drug ourselves out of the house tonight because we thought it would be more fun
8830695 this election has never been about me its about you
8830696 he represents the dream and the hope i have not for myself but for my children and grandchildren
8830697 it was motivating inspiring not just rhetoric but from deep within his soul
8830698 but it was a little warm in there wasnt it
8830699 they cant re create the reagan coalition life has changed americas priorities are different
8830700 that may be changing in regard to the republican party
8830701 there was a lot of lip service paid to ronald reagan by the candidates but when you get down to specifics they are tilting away from reagan toward some new mix
8830702 its a very rare leader who can bring together disparate groups when they agree on 70 percent and disagree on 30 percent reagan was able to succeed at that bush has been more susceptible to these divisions
8830703 people now are looking for reasons to argue rather than reasons to cooperate
8830704 there are big elements still out there waiting for someone to unite them
8830705 we have a zero tolerance when it comes to failure to protect your workers from workplace hazards which includes the summer heat for outdoor workers
8830706 our actions taken since the heat illness protection law became effective reveal this and our efforts are only intensifying
8830707 people who fancy themselves as being more important than politicians
8830708 multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets
8830709 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8830710 if its right that theyve arrested the man who was in charge i will sue him
8830711 this incident shows the need for an end to the random arrest of iraqis by the american forces which are against the human rights outlined in the constitution it proves for a fact that each iraqi might be arrested or put in prison without knowing the reasons
8830712 it is a message for the baathists to go on in their wrongdoings
8830713 this guy was doing his job perfectly hes served his country by all his efforts since 2003
8830714 when i had a look at our systems it was clear that your account was closed on 03 03 08 and the ip that you were using was allocated to a new customer after that our systems clearly show this so i am not 100 per cent sure how the abuse team got your name associated to the ip
8830715 het is nauwelijks te voorspellen wat de omzet van morgen is zo grillig is het op dit moment
8830716 de kredietcrisis heeft ook zijn weerslag op het consumentenvertrouwen waardoor de bestedingen aan slaapkamers stagneren
8830717 in beijing there were fantastic results but i think we can look at it as a stepping stone for london 2012
8830718 if we can be top of the rowing medal table without our home crowd in london im sure we can do better
8830719 he started off this year saying this would be the very very last year he ever does it and hes going to retire full stop
8830720 i do this sport because i love winning and i love racing and as long as it keeps going like that im sure ill love doing it
8830721 jai perdu mon travail je ne veux pas de probl mes monsieur morandini et monsieur castaldi essayez de r fl chir un petit peu propos de ma situation si je suis l cest dans lintention que vous retiriez votre plainte ces propos c tait pas dans mon intention sic pour moi internet c tait virtuel javais pas conscience des cons quences que a pouvait engendrer je ne suis pas fier et je ne donne le conseil de faire a personne
8830722 comment taient peints les murs quelle tapisserie faisait r ver des gentes dames dans ces habitats photos
8830723 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8830724 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8830725 it is that promise thats always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well thats why i stand here tonight
8830726 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8830727 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8830728 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its because john mccain doesnt get it
8830729 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8830730 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8830731 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8830732 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8830733 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8830734 when we talked about an open convention this is what democrats meant
8830735 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8830736 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8830737 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8830738 they got exit stamps from the palestinian government they boarded the ships and soon theyll be in international waters and then in cyprus this is the first time ever that palestinians have been able to freely enter and leave their own country
8830739 if these were terrorists we would care but the fact is we allowed it
8830740 if anyone expects a regular flow of ships going back and forth this is not going to happen
8830741 hamas sent a message to arab countries who they feel arent doing anything saying these western activists managed to do what you havent been able to do for two years
8830742 i would do a telephone interview for the media in hebrew and by the end there would be a dozen palestinians around me who all wanted to speak to me in hebrew and tell me about their friends in tel aviv
8830743 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8830744 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8830745 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8830746 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8830747 as long as the hurricane has louisiana in its sights this is where ill be were still hopeful that the storm will miss us but weve got to prepare as if its coming our way
8830748 i was young na ve enough to think i would see that in 5 10 years
8830749 then you see leaders killed you see police brutality residential segregation in cities about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this this is something for my grandchildren
8830750 we have a lot of work a lot but we are so much closer than i expected
8830751 weve had disappointments since then but if someone told me i would be here
8830752 when people say nothing has changed i feel like saying come walk in my shoes
8830753 we have one foot in both eras were still living out a lot of anger
8830754 people ask what has changed and i say dont trivialize the changes
8830755 im seeing the fruit of the changes that began in 1964
8830756 i doubt anyone would argue now that the 2000 election didnt matter
8830757 mccain is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies those policies all over again
8830758 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8830759 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8830760 with john mccains support president bush and vice president cheney have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact their readiness to sacrifice the long term to the short term subordinate the general good to the benefit of the few and short circuit the rule of law
8830761 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you believe its time for a change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8830762 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8830763 abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
8830764 a change from the approach of bush cheney and mccain
8830765 abandon ing the search for the terrorists who attacked us
8830766 because it would bring in his words shame disgrace and ruin to our nation
8830767 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress
8830768 was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
8830769 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8830770 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8830771 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
8830772 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8830773 you dont ever want to get swept especially in the situation were in
8830774 we had to really fight to win that last one
8830775 weve been stale we havent been able to get the big hit we havent been able to make a big pitch
8830776 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8830777 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers

8830785 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8830786 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8830787 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
8830788 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8830789 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8830790 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8830791 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8830792 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational

8830795 its extremely important because it focuses on a highly credible group of individuals
8830796 we wanted to make sure they were at a full strength
8830797 they only had a week of practice which is not exactly what you had hoped to have had actually two days of practice thats not as though we had a full week
8830798 so now we have a chance to get everybody with a full week under their belt particularly coming off what they were coming off you dont want to overstress the muscles

8830802 wir treffen uns in einem entscheidenden moment einem moment in dem sich unser land im krieg befindet unsere wirtschaft in aufruhr ist und das amerikanische versprechen wieder einmal bedroht ist
8830803 wir sind hier weil wir dieses land zu sehr lieben als das die kommenden vier jahre wie die letzten acht aussehen d rften
8830804 ich bin nicht der wahrscheinlichste kandidat f r ein solches amt
8830805 aber heute abend stehe ich vor ihnen weil sich berall in amerika etwas bewegt
8830806 mit dem heiligen schwur ihnen die ausr stung zu geben die sie in der schlacht brauchen sowie die versorgung und unterst tzung die sie verdienen wenn sie heimkehren
8830807 i thought the first team guys did we got the ball and drove it down twice we should have had a touchdown the first time but settled for a field goal defensively we were able to get a turnover and basically held them to zero points we started putting the backups in and they started making some mistakes we gave them 10 points to go into the half at 10 10 in the second half we didnt do nearly as well as we needed to do but we were playing with the down the line guys
8830808 he played much better tonight he looked more like a quarterback that you would expect a quarterback to look like tonight i thought he managed his team drove them down for two scores and he was eager and wanted to play some more i told him he was going to sit with me after the first two series they all wanted to sit with me they knew that this was the last preseason game and now it starts counting
8830809 he had a good night he was trying to take advantage of the opportunity given to him so you have to applaud him for that
8830810 im glad its over we just had too many injuries during the course of the preseason and now we have to see if we can get these guys back because dallas is coming to town
8830811 we didnt really play a team like that necessarily last year its going to be a great challenge for us and theyre going to get a lot of hype because theyre a great team both on defense and offense its going to take a great effort for us to win the game
8830812 the expectations have risen now after my rookie year and none greater than from myself im really hoping and working hard on having a better year than last year its just the way i am and as offensive linemen thats just the way we are we worry about the game ahead of us and work hard on the things we need to improve on
8830813 i felt pretty good there are a few things i would like to change but aside from that we were able to get into a rhythm i didnt want to come out of the game because we were on a roll and i wanted to put more points up on the board
8830814 like anything else with more experience youre able to grasp a better knowledge for the game it was easier to adapt to different wide receivers and tight ends
8830815 yes we are excited to get the season going at this point in time our focus is on dallas over the next week
8830816 we were in a little cover three and i tried to play it i tried to bait them a little bit he ended up throwing it right before he got hit by our defensive line i think dl robaire smith hit him and disrupted his throw and it ended up in my hands
8830817 im just glad its over it has been a long training camp im ready to get these practice games out of the way and start the real season
8830818 we worked hard and we did a lot of things better than last year that shows a lot of promise the offense moved the ball well i feel great about going in and beating the cowboys next week
8830819 we came out of the gates early which is something that we werent able to do last week and the week before that were headed in the right direction its the end of preseason and we can go out and fix the mistakes we made we have a couple days before we start our preparation for dallas we need to get these guys some rest so we can come out and hit this thing full speed
8830820 we could have done better but we made progress from last week thats probably the most important thing we have a couple days off so some guys can get some rest
8830821 it was an alright performance but obviously we wanted to come out with a victory and end the preseason with a win the offense showed signs of executing the small things we have been working on at camp it feels good to get the opportunity because that is what you want i think i made the most of my opportunities except for the one i dropped on the sidelines

8830831 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8830832 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that ms deda said
8830833 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8830834 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points mr oughton said

8830838 they are trying to line up some sort of hybrid issue but that could be the last throw of the dice unless someone comes in at the eleventh hour
8830839 people have been waiting for something like this to happen all year but really theres nothing to it
8830840 theyre trying to make issues out of things that arent quite issues
8830841 im very relaxed at the moment i know both wayne and ivan are focused on getting up to where we want to go
8830842 you handle these things delicately when theres two personalities involved
8830843 at this time of the year theres tension and nerves anyway whether coaches are going or coming
8830844 its semi final time and everyones on edge and youre tying to get a top four spot so theres always going to be tension
8830845 theyre both professionals and ive got confidence in to carry out the job and leave the personal stuff behind

8830873 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said

8830889 this is something very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8830890 i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8830891 if arsene said he needed 30 million for a striker he would get it no problem at all
8830892 it is not our decision who he spends money on and nor will it ever be we totally back arsene but there is a dual problem for him
8830893 if we were to buy the sort of big names that people talk about we would be looking at relatively mature players who then need to be integrated into the way we play
8830894 secondly it impacts on the youngsters and in many cases arsene thinks it is quicker for us to bring a player through our system but that does not mean all we are interested in is the artistic achievement award
8830895 we are not settling for second best we want to win trophies and i think it is time we did but arsene also believes in creating teams with a certain style
8830896 there were great hopes that we would buy heavily this summer but i would refute that we have not bought well nasri has two goals in two games at the emirates stadium and if ars ne could find the right player he would buy again but he hasnt
8830897 i hear all the time that we have no money but i just wish someone would take the time to look at our accounts this is a proper business which produces its own cash and lives or dies by its performances
8830898 our net payments are 20 million and the revenue increase from the new stadium is close to 50 million explain to me how that stadium is a drain on the club when it produces an extra 30 million a year
8830899 this constant suggestion that the stadium is bleeding us dry is crap the reality is our wage bill is very similar to manchester united substantially above liverpool and substantially below chelsea but that is to be expected
8830900 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well
8830901 anyone could play against andorra but croatia is different you need players who are 100
8830902 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now
8830903 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8830904 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch

8830918 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8830919 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself
8830920 i think its a bit hypocritical when the police have been saying for months that the taser is safe and only has short term effects that the police commissioner himself is scared of being tasered

8830925 guys fighting for their careers guys trying to finish on a high players really want to win this game we are back at the mcg for the first time this year we want to play well in front of the supporters and the people that will be at the ground
8830926 players will hopefully perform or cement their spot or give the coaches something to talk about
8830927 it gives us a bit of pride bit of confidence going into pre season if we can win our last two games of the year it gives our players something that says we do have a good team and that we are pretty confident in our abilities to play
8830928 obviously theyve got a lot of bigger guys we are going to have to play pretty physical we will have to match them in that area
8830929 they play a little bit different game style compared to the rest of the competition they are happy to play wide they do kick the ball long to their tall targets thats something that you can take out of their game style
8830930 weve performed pretty well against north melbourne the last five times weve played them and their game style is very similar
8830931 they are very smart stoppage team adam simpson is their captain he drives a lot of their stoppage work and hes super smart theyve got a lot of tricks in their bag

8830936 ce ne sont pas des d placements tr s lointain mais la poule est difficile il ny a pas une quipe plus faible quune autre sil fallait sortir un favori je dirais liverpool mais a va tre difficile daller chercher des points pour tout le monde il ne faut surtout pas avoir peur car ce nest que du bonheur de rencontrer ses quipes on a voulu tre l on y est cest nous de jouer
8830937 cest une poule relev e on ne pr sente plus le bayern le steaua on connait on connait le football roumain qui progresse quant la fiorentina elle sort dune tr s grosse saison en 2007 2008 il faudra tre r gulier et prendre des points de partout ce sera tr s ouvert pour moi il ny a pas de favori il faudra batailler avec ce groupe nous serons forc ment vigilants
8830938 cest un tirage tr s tr s dur cest du tr s costaud

8830940 sugar is one sector where probably people could invest buy and hold kind of a strategy than a buy and trade strategy so that sector is going to be slightly volatile when it is making the base most of the stocks had run up also largely so for me on the longer perspective on the monthly or yearly charts that looks fabulous every bad news has got to be bought into on the downside without looking eventually this sector will do very well i think much more highs are on the offing for the sector so any fall today because of this news is a buy for me the top pick for me is renuka sugars followed by bajaj hindusthan and balrampur chini and the last will be the triveni engineering so it is a great investment buy on the downside
8830941 as a contrarion view we are very positive on the financial space it is known the fact that above 9 is going to be a severe hit on the bond portfolio of the banks there is a slowdown in the credit reserve bank of india rbi is a very hawkish all those things are known but what needs to be kept in mind that perhaps we are nearing the phase where inflation will plateau out around 13 13 5 and there could be at worst one more round of rate hike coming from rbi on cash reserve ration crr hike so we are very near the end of the negative sentiment build up in the financial space
8830942 on the other hand one has the valuations which are extremely attractive in case of psu banks if one senses the subsidiary valuations and insurance plays the core banking businesses are available at one time and less than one time one is building in a fact that there is going to be no growth in book which is not true so even in this scenario we are going to see a growth in the book i think there is a great value offering as we have seen today whenever there is a feeling that interest rates have plateau out or peaked out this is a one sector which is going to be a serious outperformer
8830943 when crude was at about usd 111 112 bbl we did recommend our clients to get into cairn india at around rs 235 236 level for a target of rs 256 266 yesterday it came almost up to rs 254 my belief on crude is that i do not think it is going below usd 108 bbl if there is one commodity in the world which has a chance to go up and make a new high that will be crude on the upside i think usd 125 132 bbl is the band we are looking at so if crude does eventually go up there cairn should benefit so rs 266 will be the upside target today because crude was little bit soft yesterday if it comes to around rs 245 again it is a buy

8831029 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons

8831065 amerika wir sind besser als diese letzten acht jahre wir lieben dieses land zu sehr als dass die kommenden vier jahre aussehen wie die vergangenen acht
8831066 mit tiefer dankbarkeit und gro er demut akzeptiere ich die nominierung f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten
8831067 w re stolz auf barack obama gewesen stolz auf die partei die ihn nominiert hat und stolz auf das amerika das ihn w hlen wird
8831068 amerika braucht mehr als einen gro en pr sidenten um den traum meines vaters zu verwirklichen
8831069 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8831070 youll need lots of capital talent luck and financial discipline to see your project through
8831071 but i must say it is easy creating a new corporate community and economic boom that will benefit those around us greatly many times start up companies tend to become burdens to the general public beacuse they fold or otherwise go under but companies like mine mitigate that risk and show profits right away this means less foreclosures and higher credit limits for businesspeople like me who are looking to the future of the online casino industry
8831072 i thought id be answering phone calls from creditors and writing order forms out by hand now that we see the potential of the online casino consumer market weve immediately hired new staff to meet the high demands of this market
8831073 because many see them as rough investment forecasts or as prospectuses for local companies as a result there is a big scramble to get this info and buy into local online casino businesses right away before market prices exceed a reasonable investment amount
8831074 ive always wanted to start my own online casino company through the internet
8831075 and now i can because of new government grants for internet start ups
8831076 we got start up capital from family friends and a few bank loans
8831077 and then slowly paid each respective party off one at a time this took about five years to do but all debts were satisfied with full repayment and some extra for interest
8831078 it doesnt matter to us whether or not someone gets a lot of tds all that matters is the win at the end of the game
8831079 he sullivan is the one who finished off plays but we had a lot of guys who ran hard
8831080 he had one of those days and scored five times and good for him
8831081 our quarterback green made a great play and no 4 yahyavi made a great catch
8831082 as much heat as jeremy was taking earlier from the cheyenne defense he still hung in there and made a great play
8831083 we did not quit we played hard we pushed as hard as we could and thats a positive they the desert shields are just a damned good football team they just came out and plowed us we got stuffed on the line and had trouble breaking through
8831084 you have to be physical in our conference our conference games every week are like that
8831085 i thought that our conditioning was good i thought we were in pretty good shape we got tired but we werent tired enough to make plays and function that was what was most important
8831086 i had that taste in my mouth and i was excited more so than nervous
8831087 i was just talking to brynn last night and i was like i learned a lot from her last year and i tell her that all the time
8831088 she just gave me a good idea of what it means to be a collegiate goalkeeper and she set the standards high for me and i am just kind of chasing what she did
8831089 we had a coachs meeting with jason goodson assistant coach and he let me know that i had done enough work and proved myself in practice and they put me in there
8831090 an eight gives me room for improvement but i just felt like i had a really solid performance and after the game it was like cloud nine and i was really excited to have gotten a chance to prove myself and my skills
8831091 i was pleased for lindsay you know i was pleased for the whole team to keep a clean sheet but in particular our back four and lindsay just based upon the changes that have happened this year
8831092 its a little bigger than home actually its a lot bigger
8831093 theres a few things i need to work on but im getting it done
8831094 there are other people who want it but im going to play as hard as i can so they cant take it
8831095 but the first hit i get or someone hits me theyll be gone
8831096 im hoping we can get better on a daily basis
8831097 hes a very accomplished route runner right now hes got really soft hands and the ability to catch the ball so were just trying to work on the other aspects of his game
8831098 as long as we do that for four quarters chances are were going to be in a ballgame and have a great chance to win it
8831099 i think this is the most athletic team weve played in seattle and theyre going to give us a tough battle
8831100 were expecting athleticism and for them to make plays theyre going to fly around its the first game and a lot of teams are anxious to get out there
8831101 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8831102 a thorough inquiry was undertaken into his death the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal markss death
8831103 its challenging in the sense that its something i havent done in the past i have tatoos all over my body
8831104 i love my character here so i asked my bosses if i can do this one

8831126 the womens team is excited and hungry to face the obstacles and challenges they know are ahead of them this season
8831127 the women are eager to return to being a feared team at both the conference and national levels were starting the year with the deepest quality of runners that we have had since the 2002 season and strong leadership throughout the team
8831128 the team will round into shape at the right time and we feel great about our runners and their capabilities
8831129 that would be pretty darn cool to win that in our rookie year

8831135 this is our national dress you dont see them much now in the summer but in the winter everyone wears them because it keeps the cold out
8831136 today the customers especially the foreigners prefer the imports god only knows why
8831137 they should buy from us and support the local industry
8831138 in italy you see women wearing keffiyehs around their necks are those people terrorists
8831139 we buy from hirbawi because he makes all these colours the foreigners love them
8831140 it is a symbol of palestine and of chairman arafat but not of terrorism the israelis came here and made problems for us and all we are doing is defending our rights

8831147 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8831148 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have

8831150 intel recognises that the internet is capable of transforming lives and the future of our country through the connected indians movement we hope to achieve precisely that this movement is privileged to be supported by the government ecosystem partners as well as numerous other industry stalwarts we expect to see the momentum for this initiative building up rapidly
8831151 earlier this year i outlined my digital vision for india at the world congress of it in kuala lumpur 500 million indians connected to the internet and its unlimited opportunities with more than l00 million broadband connections and 100 million broadband enabled devices to drive this connected indian milieu leading to the development and growth of a vibrant economy all by 2012 since then we have made much progress and my ministry is well on its way to executing this task

8831153 i was very nervous about his arrival saturday about how i looked about how we were going to feel when we got home
8831154 hes developed so much hes talking a lot more its a great surprise
8831155 at times there were close to 250 people i was responsible for
8831156 everybody here and there was very supportive were very thankful it was a positive experience as much as it can be
8831157 my son its his second time deployed and my brother its his third tour there i wanted to do my part to help them out
8831158 its certainly not our intention to imply that immigrants are responsible for global warming
8831159 immigrants in the united states produce an estimated four times more carbon dioxide in the united states as they would have in their countries of origin
8831160 if they were included the impact would be much higher
8831161 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8831162 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8831163 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8831164 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8831165 were looking to be sure we dont fall behind in making mexico a strategic logistics platform for trade and global investment
8831166 theres clearly going to be port demand that punta colonet could serve
8831167 but what share of it theyll get is still an unanswered question
8831168 theres a certain amount of cargo thats locally destined that really doesnt make sense to ship out anywhere else
8831169 more like a relief valve for us than a direct competitor
8831170 there will not be any hiccups because we have a lot of other people working on downtown
8831171 im assuming some of his construction and oversight on depot plaza and the west side
8831172 he believes the arts are a part of downtown and needed to be part of the planning for revitalization
8831173 the aim for the alliance was to have a clean and safe downtown and support downtown businesses
8831174 he carried that very far as far as safety goes we now have more police protection which came about because of the alliances efforts

8831180 one or two pieces of art sticking in the front yard
8831181 i think we need to see how the program works before we change it
8831182 i have no problem using public money for public art
8831183 but in tough economic times we need a better understanding of how the dollars are spent
8831184 we had such a positive reaction to it we are thinking about making it a weekly feature
8831185 we dont want to be in a fight with hartlepool united any more than any other club
8831186 we could have stayed out of it but there is a principle here if we dont all stick together on these issues next time it could be another club and another newspaper
8831187 i question what the sponsors make of it all they want to see their pictures in the paper i have had people within the club telling me they think its ridiculous its about common sense
8831188 to be honest if they kicked us out they would just smuggle other people in we will get it covered somehow
8831189 why dont you make it up thats what you usually do
8831190 well you couldnt move to a smaller one could you
8831191 some football clubs are biting the hands that feed them
8831192 local papers are their biggest supporters reporting on them and encouraging them in good times and bad
8831193 without them the clubs would have precious little publicity and with gates that are pitifully low they need all the help they can get

8831211 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8831212 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8831213 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8831214 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8831215 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8831216 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8831217 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted

8831289 we all know that its a more difficult environment to get credit i dont think theres any doubt about that but we also know that the banks have just announced what are for most of them still record profit levels
8831290 so if the reserve bank cuts rates as i hope that they do i would expect all banks repeat all banks to pass on those cuts to customers
8831291 if some banks choose not to do that then i think youll see a competitive market environment
8831292 consumers will exercise their choice and i think if any bank didnt you would see consumers who would shop around in the market to get a better deal and thats a healthy thing
8831293 probably the biggest low of my sporting career right at the end but you know sort of taking that fairytale ending away was shattering

8831304 es ist diese verhei ung die dieses land immer zu einem besonderen gemacht hat dass jeder seine pers nlichen tr ume wahr machen kann
8831305 vor vier jahren stand ich vor euch und habe euch meine geschichte erz hlt von der kurzen verbindung zwischen einem jungen mann aus kenia und einer jungen frau aus kansas die nicht wohlhabend oder bekannt waren aber den glauben teilten dass ihr sohn in amerika alles erreichen kann was immer er auch vorhat es ist diese verhei ung die dieses land immer zu einem besonderen gemacht hat dass durch harte arbeit und opfer jeder von uns seine pers nlichen tr ume wahr machen kann dass wir aber dabei immer noch als eine amerikanische familie zusammenkommen um sicherzustellen dass die n chste generation ihre tr ume ebenfalls verfolgen kann das ist der grund warum ich heute abend hier stehe weil 232 jahre lang gew hnliche m nner und frauen studenten und soldaten bauern und lehrer krankenschwestern und hausmeister immer den mut gefunden haben die verhei ung am leben zu erhalten wann immer sie gef hrdet war wir sind in einem dieser entscheidenden momente zusammengekommen einem moment in dem unsere nation im krieg ist unsere wirtschaft in aufruhr und in dem die amerikanische verhei ung einmal mehr bedroht ist heute abend sind mehr amerikaner ohne arbeit und mehr arbeiten h rter f r weniger lohn mehr von euch haben ihr haus verloren und mehr beobachten wie der wert ihres hauses abst rzt mehr von euch haben autos die ihr euch nicht mehr leisten k nnt kreditkartenabrechnungen die ihr nicht mehr bezahlen k nnt und schulgeld das nicht mehr in eurer reichweite liegt diese herausforderungen sind nicht alle auf die regierung zur ckzuf hren aber das versagen darauf zu antworten ist ein direktes ergebnis der kaputten politik in washington und der gescheiterten pr sidentschaft von george w bush amerika wir sind besser als diese vergangenen acht jahre wir sind ein besseres land als das dieser moment diese wahl ist unsere chance um die amerikanische verhei ung im 21 jahrhundert lebendig zu halten n chste woche in minnesota wird die gleiche partei die euch zwei amtszeiten von george bush und dick cheney gebracht hat dieses land um eine dritte amtszeit bitten und wir sind hier weil wir dieses land zu sehr lieben um zuzulassen dass die n chsten vier jahren genauso aussehen wie die vergangenen acht am 4 november m ssen wir aufstehen und sagen acht sind genug lasst uns an einer sache nicht zweifeln der nominierte republikaner john mccain hat die uniform unseres landes mit tapferkeit und auszeichnung getragen und deswegen schulden wir ihm unsere dankbarkeit und respekt und n chste woche werden wir auch von anl ssen h ren bei denen er mit seiner partei gebrochen hat als beweis dass er f r den wechsel sorgen kann den wir brauchen aber die bilanz ist deutlich john mccain hat zu 90 prozent der zeit mit george bush gestimmt senator mccain spricht gern ber urteilskraft aber was sagt dies wirklich ber urteilskraft aus wenn man glaubt dass george bush zu mehr als 90 prozent der zeit richtig lag ich wei nicht wie es euch geht aber ich bin nicht bereit mich auf eine zehnprozentige chance f r den wechsel einzulassen ihr seht wir demokraten haben einen ganz anderen ma stab f r fortschritt in diesem land wir messen fortschritt daran wie viele leute einen job finden k nnen mit dem sie ihre hypotheken zahlen k nnen ob man am ende des monats ein bisschen geld zur seite legen kann damit man eines tages erleben kann dass das eigene kind sein diplom macht wir messen fortschritt an den 23 millionen neuen jobs die geschaffen wurden als bill clinton pr sident war als die amerikanische durchschnittsfamilie erlebte wie ihr einkommen um 7 500 dollar gestiegen ist anstatt um 2 000 dollar zu sinken wie es unter george bush gewesen ist wir messen die st rke unserer wirtschaft nicht an der zahl der milliard re die wir haben oder an den gewinnen im fortune 500 sondern daran ob jemand mit einer guten idee das wagnis aufnehmen und eine firma gr nden kann oder ob die kellnerin die von trinkgeldern lebt einen tag frei nehmen kann um nach einem kranken kind zu sehen ohne ihren arbeitsplatz zu verlieren eine wirtschaft die die w rde der arbeit respektiert die basisdaten die wir verwenden um wirtschaftliche st rke zu messen sind die ob wir dieses grundlegende versprechen erf llen dass dieses land gro gemacht hat eine verhei ung die der einzige grund ist warum ich heute abend hier stehe das ist das versprechen das wir halten m ssen daher lasst mich genau sagen was dieser wechsel bedeuten w rde wenn ich pr sident bin wechsel bedeutet ein steuerrecht das nicht die lobbyisten belohnt die es geschrieben haben sondern die amerikanischen arbeiter und kleinen unternehmen die es verdienen anders als john mccain will ich die steuerk rzungen f r konzerne beenden die unsere arbeitspl tze nach bersee auslagern und ich werde damit anfangen sie an firmen zu geben die hier in amerika gute jobs schaffen ich werde die kapitalertragssteuern f r kleinunternehmen und startups abschaffen welche die gut bezahlten high tech jobs von morgen schaffen ich werde die steuern k rzen f r 95 prozent aller arbeiterfamilien weil es in einer wirtschaft wie dieser das letzte sein sollte die steuern f r die mittelschicht zu erh hen und um unserer wirtschaft und unserer sicherheit und der zukunft unseres planeten willen will ich ein klares ziel als pr sident setzen in zehn jahren werden wir endlich unsere abh ngigkeit von l aus dem nahen osten beenden washington spricht seit 30 jahren von unserer abh ngigkeit vom l und john mccain ist 26 jahre davon da gewesen in dieser zeit hat er nein gesagt zu h heren standards f r die kraftstoffeffizienz von autos nein zu investitionen in erneuerbare energien nein zu erneuerbaren kraftstoffen und heute importieren wir dreimal so viel l wie an dem tag als senator mccain ins amt gekommen ist nun ist es an der zeit diese abh ngigkeit zu beenden und einzusehen dass lbohrungen eine notl sung sind keine langfristige l sung weit gefehlt als pr sident werde ich unsere erdgasreserven anzapfen in saubere kohlentechnik investieren und wege finden um die atomkraft sicher zu nutzen ich werde unseren automobilfirmen bei der umr stung helfen damit die kraftstoffeffizienten autos der zukunft hier in amerika gebaut werden ich werde es f r die amerikaner einfacher machen sich diese neuen autos leisten zu k nnen und ich werde im n chsten jahrzehnt 150 milliarden dollar in erschwingliche erneuerbare energiequellen investieren windenergie und solarenergie und die n chste generation von biokraftstoffen eine investition die zu neuen branchen und f nf millionen neuen arbeitspl tzen f hrt welche gut bezahlt sind nie ausgelagert werden k nnen wir sind die partei von roosevelt wir sind die partei kennedys daher soll mir niemand sagen dass die demokraten dieses land nicht verteidigen k nnten niemand soll mir sagen dass demokraten nicht f r unsere sicherheit sorgen k nnten die bush mccain au enpolitik hat das erbe verprasst dass generationen von amerikanern demokraten und republikaner aufgebaut haben und wir m ssen dieses erbe erneuern als oberbefehlshaber werde ich nie z gern diese nation zu verteidigen aber ich werde truppen zur schadensabwehr nur mit einer klaren mission und einer heiligen verpflichtung entsenden ihnen die ausstattung zu geben die sie im kampf brauchen sowie schutz und versorgung die sie verdienen wenn sie wieder nach hause kommen ich werde diesen krieg im irak verantwortungsvoll beenden ebenso wie den kampf gegen al kaida und die taliban in afghanistan ich werde unsere streitkr fte erneuern damit sie k nftigen konflikten begegnen k nnen aber ich werde auch die harte direkte diplomatie erneuern die den iran daran hindern kann sich in den besitz von atomwaffen zu bringen ich werde neue partnerschaften errichten um die bedrohungen des 21 jahrhunderts zu besiegen terrorismus und weiterverbreitung von atomwaffen armut und v lkermord klimawandel und seuchen und ich werde unser moralisches ansehen wiederherstellen damit amerika einmal mehr die letzte beste hoffnung f r alle ist die f r die sache der freiheit berufen sind die sich nach einem leben in frieden und nach einer besseren zukunft

8831459 well structured and organised franchises which focus on the operational success of individual franchisees rather than franchise sales are best placed to successfully navigate the current turbulent market conditions compared to independent stand alone businesses

8831476 truesight im is helping us meet our goal of providing the best possible service at the least possible cost
8831477 now we can drill down on links and see exactly which one is causing the problem developers love the detailed information and we can now provide applications that are thoroughly tested from a real user perspective
8831478 previously our web services team spent hours trying to reproduce end user problems without success now we can instantly drill down to determine whether problems are on our end or at the users service provider
8831479 we used to spend hours trying to reproduce end user problems without success truesight im allows us to zero in on problems that have already occurred without having to reproduce them
8831480 previously our web services team was not equipped to perform end to end monitoring
8831481 truesight im did not require users to change their environment at all also it was easy to use and because it is a turnkey system that ships fully configured we were able to easily drop it into place and start using it immediately
8831482 now when we get calls from students or faculty we can instantly drill down to determine whether it was on our end or whether it was with the users service provider
8831483 soon after we started using truesight im to monitor our portal we observed a high error rate because truesight im tracks details of every transaction in real time we were able to see that a gif file on the login page was not where the system expected it which meant that delays occurred whenever the page was loaded once we moved the file the error rate plummeted instantly this was an immediate benefit because the portal wasnt giving us any indication of errors so we never would have known about this otherwise
8831484 slow service frustrates users so we need to know about it and contact blackboard or fix it ourselves in the case of the portal or web server truesight gives us tangible measurements of our performance so we can meet user expectations
8831485 weve started looking at providing dashboards to create observation access to performance views to allow managers to log in and monitor the most important performance indicators
8831486 to contribute to progress by providing relevant views and opinions represented in articles on the current issues of the day

8831506 you might see people in similar positions bring similar suits and rely upon this as precedent and then maybe well start to have pockets of places throughout the state where this is being permitted and again the state legislature might find itself in a position where for the sake of consistency it has to go back and change the law or decide not to enforce it against petition circulators throughout the state

8831517 in this account churchills we prefer to believe that the story with which geoffrey delighted the fiction loving europe of the twelfth century is not all fancy if we could see exactly what happened we should find ourselves in the presence of a theme as well founded as inspired and as inalienable from the inheritance of mankind as the odyssey or the old testament it is all true or it ought to be

8831572 college campuses have also served an important role in promoting podcasts many colleges and universities now provide podcasts of various lecture series and important speakers on campus

8831574 maka hadapkanlah wajahmu dengan lurus kepada agama allah tetaplah atas fitrah allah yang telah menciptakan manusia menurut fitrah itu tidak ada perubahan pada fitrah allah
8831575 setiap anak dilahirkan dalam keadaan fitrah maka kedua ibu bapaknyalah yang membuatnya yahudi atau nasrani atau majusi
8831576 dan mereka mengingkarinya karena kezaliman dan kesombongan mereka padahal hati mereka meyakini kebenaran nya
8831577 dan ingatlah ketika luqman berkata kepada anaknya diwaktu ia memberi pelajaran kepadanya hai anakku janganlah kamu mempersekutukan allah sesungguhnya mempersekutukan allah adalah benar benar kezaliman yang besar
8831578 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik dan dia mengampuni segalah dosa yang selain dari syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendakinya barangsiapa yang mempersekutukan allah maka sungguh ia telah berbuat dosa yang besar
8831579 sesungguhnya orang yang mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan allah maka pasti allah mengharamkan kepadanya surga dan tempatnya ialah neraka
8831580 barang siapa yang mati dalam keadaan menyembah selain allah masukkanlah ia ke dalam neraka
8831581 barang siapa menemui allah mati dalam keadaan tidak berbuat syirik kepadanya sedikitpun pasti masuk surga tetapi barang siapa yang menemui nya mati dalam keadaan berbuat sesuatu kesyirikan kepadanya pastilah masuk neraka
8831582 dan mereka menyembah selain allah apa yang tidak dapat mendatangkan kemudharatan kepada mereka dan tidak pula kemanfaatan dan mereka berkata
8831583 maka apabila mereka naik kapal mereka berdoa kepada allah dengan memurnikan ketaatan keadanya maka tatkala allah menyelamatkan mereka sampai ke darat tiba tiba mereka kembali menyekutukan allah
8831584 barangsiapa menghendaki kehidupan dunia dan perhiasan nya niscaya kami berikan kepada mereka balasan pekerjaan mereka di dunia dengan sempurna dan mereka di dunia itu tidak akan dirugikan itulah orang orang yang tidak diperoleh diakhirat itu apa yang telah mereka usahakan di dunia dan sia sialah apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
8831585 mereka menjadikan orang orang alimnya dan rahib rahib mereka sebagai tuhan selain allah dan juga mereka mempertuhankan al masih putera maryam padahal mereka hanya bahan yang haq selain dia maha suci allah dari apa yang mereka persekutukan
8831586 dan di antara manusia ada orang orang yang menjadikannya sebagaimana mereka mencintai allah
8831587 janganlah kalian bersumpah dengan menggunakan nama nenek moyang kalian barangsiapa yang bersumpah dengan menggunakan nama allah hendaklah benar dan barangsiapa yang diberi sumpah dengan menggunakan nama allah hendaklah rela barangsiapa yang tidak rela maka lepaslah ia dari allah
8831588 barang siapa bersumpah dengan nama selain allah maka ia telah berbuat kufur atau syirik
8831589 bahwa ada seseorang berkata kepada nabi saw atas kehendak allah dan kehendakmu maka ketika itu bersabdalah beliau
8831590 dan kamu tidak dapat menghendaki sesuatu kecuali apabila dikehendaki allah rabb semesta alam
8831591 cukuplah allah bagiku hanya kepadanyalah bertawakkalnya orang orang yang berserah diri
8831592 barang siapa menggantungkan tamimah semoga allah tidak mengabulkan keinginannya dan barangsiapa yang menggantungkan wadaah semoga allah tidak memberi ketenangan pada dirinya disebutkan dalam riwayat lain barangsiapa menggantungkan tamimah maka dia telah berbuat syirik
8831593 maka barangsiapa mengharap perjumpaan dengan rabbnya hendaklah ia mengerjakan amal shalih dan janganlah ia berbuat syirik sedikitpun dalam beribadah kepada rabbnya
8831594 sesuatu yang paling aku khawatirkan kepada kamu sekalian adalah perbuatan syirik kecil ketika ditanya tentang maksudnya beliau menjawab yaitu riya
8831595 celakalah hamba dinar celakalah hamba dirham celakalah hamba khamishah dan celakalah khamilah
8831596 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik tetapi dia mengampuni segala dosa selain syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya
8831597 barang siapa yang mati dalam keadaan menyembah selain allah masukkanlah ia ke dalam neraka
8831598 barang siapa menemui allah mati dalam keadaan tidak berbuat syirik kepadanya sedikitpun pasti masuk surga tetapi barang siapa yang menemui nya mati dalam keadaan berbuat sesuatu kesyirikan kepadanya pastilah masuk neraka
8831599 maka apakah patut kamu hai orang orang musyrik menganggap al lata dan al uzza dan yang lain yang ketiga yaitu manat apakah patut untuk kamu anak laki laki dan untuk allah anak perempuan yang demikian itu tentulah suatu pembagian yang tidak adil itu tidak lain hanyalah nama nama yang kamu dan bapak bapak kamu mengada adakan allah tidak menurunkan sesuatu keteranganpun untuk menyembah nya mereka tidak lain hanyalah mengikuti hawa nafsu mereka dan sesungguhnya telah datang petunjuk kepada mereka dari tuhan mereka
8831600 suatu saat kami pergi ke hunain bersama rasulullah saw sedang kami dalam keadaan baru saja lepas dari kekafiran masuk islam ketika itu orang orang musyrik mempunyai sebatang pohon bidara yang disebut
8831601 ya rasululllah buatkanlah untuk kami dzatul anwath sebagaimana mereka punyai maka rasulullah bersabda
8831602 allahu akbar itulah tradisi orang orang sebelum kamu demi allah yang diriku berada di tangannya kamu benar benar telah mengucapkan suatu perkataan seperti yang dikatakan oleh bani israil kepada musa buatkalah untuk kami sesembahan sebagaimana mereka mempunyai sesembahan musa menjawab sungguh kalian adalah kaum yang tidak mengerti pasti kalian akan mengikuti tradisi orang orang sebelum kalian
8831603 ya allah janganlah engkau jadikan kuburanku sebagai berhala yang disembah allah sangat murka kepada orang orang yang menjadikan kuburan nabi nabi mereka sebagai tempat ibadah
8831604 supaya tidak terdapat lagi kalung dari tali busur panah atau kalung apapun di leher unta kecuali harus diputuskan
8831605 janganlah berlebih lebihan memujiku sebagaimana orang nashrani telah berlebih lebihan memuji isa putera maryam
8831606 ikutilah apa yang diturunkan kepadamu dari tuhanmu dan janganlah kamu mengikuti pemimpin pemimpin selainnya amatlah sedikitlah kamu mengambil pelajaran dari padanya qs 7 al araaf 3
8831607 mereka menjadikan orang orang alimnya dan rahib rahib mereka sebagai tuhan selain allah
8831608 barangsiapa mempersekutukan sesuatu dengan allah maka adalah ia seolah olah jatuh dari langit lalu disambar oleh burung atau diterbangkan angin ke tempat yang jauh
8831609 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik dan dia mengampuni segala dosa yang selain dari syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendakinya barangsiapa yang mempersekutukan allah maka ia telah berbuat dosa yang besar
8831610 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik tetapi dia mengampuni segala dosa selain syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya
8831611 barang siapa yang mati dalam keadaan menyembah selain allah masukkanlah ia ke dalam neraka
8831612 what we have her ready to transport and are about to send her
8831613 it underscores the vulnerability of the only area in the us where energy production is growing
8831614 gustav looks like it could be heading into the heart of the gulfs oil producing area
8831615 anything that shuts in production has the potential to raise crude oil and natural gas prices quickly especially in the tight global situation we are in now

8831646 we are here because we want respect from the government

8831651 the suspicion would arise that someone in the united states created this conflict on purpose to stir up the situation and to create an advantage for one of the candidates in the competitive race for the presidency they needed a small victorious war
8831652 us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8831653 to suggest that the us orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8831654 even during the cold war during the time of tough confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we have always avoided direct clashes between our civilians let alone our servicemen

8831662 secara umum latihan saya nilai telah berlangsung dengan baik dan memenuhi sasaran latihan namun demikian saya minta seluruh pelaku latihan jangan cepat puas sebaliknya kalian harus senantiasa memelihara dan mengembangkan naluri serta kemampuan survival tempur yang telah dilatihkan sehingga ketika dihadapkan dengan situasi medan operasi yang sebenarnya kalian tahu harus berbuat apa
8831663 melalui beberapa perbukitan hutan serta dataran rendah dan perairan saya rasakan disini lokasi yang cocok untuk latihan survival tempur hanya saja kondisi cuaca yang begitu panas membuat kita para pelaku latihan harus pandai pandai menghemat tenaga dan stamina
8831664 after 30 plus years devoting myself to my art and craft i needed to make a musical statement that someday i could look back on and realize at that moment of time i did exactly what i wanted to do
8831665 ive never written songs like this i was on this inspirational roll there was an urgency to it i realized that i had no more time in my life for rehearsals and i took that energy into the studio
8831666 dengan datang langsung seperti ini saya bisa tahu kondisi riil lanud di sini dan tidak hanya membaca laporan tertulis yang saya terima di makoopsau i
8831667 a lot of these older records were made for vinyl so a lot of the frequencies were cut out because there were certain sounds you couldn t put on records
8831668 this was a good chance to get them back up to scratch because now we can make them as loud and big sounding as we want with all the added depth using the original master tapes it s the audiophile nerd side of us that accounts for some of that
8831669 the easybeats are an integral foundation stone of australian rock and roll
8831670 as a band they really were the first truly oz rock export and as songwriters performers and producers the band became the genesis of so much amazing australian music with harry vanda george young and stevie wright in particular all writing many hits and george and harry playing a hand in the careers of some of our greatest artists including ac dc the angels rose tattoo john paul young and of course stevie s solo career despite all this history well known to music industry pundits with the passing of time the easybeats and stevie probably haven t received the public accolades or broad recognition that they so richly deserve
8831671 therefore to have this tribute album featuring these extraordinary homegrown artists playing easybeats songs is really a fitting testament to the easybeats and their long standing influence as songwriters and performers of some of the greatest songs that shaped our industry
8831672 what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes
8831673 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8831674 has said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investment in renewable energy no to renewable fuels
8831675 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8831676 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8831677 i have a speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys
8831678 i havent forgotten who got me here its because of all of you
8831679 its because of all of you that michelle and i have this great honor of helping to lead this party and take back this white house everything i do i do because of what ive learned from you because of the support youve given me
8831680 here we were eating lunch and it was like the clouds parted and the sun was shining in
8831681 the struggles of working women and families arent new to any of us
8831682 so instead of talking about family values we will have policies valuing families
8831683 when women are paid less for their work who pays the price their children
8831684 were going to need you every step of the way
8831685 im going to need you every step of the way
8831686 i think everyone has a hurricane preparedness plan that we might not have had previously
8831687 weve got a command center now that is hurricane proof that was being constructed when rita hit so we do now have a secured command center where some of your emergency responders can meet
8831688 some of our customers are talking about having us work this weekend to get product into the supply line to feed their customers
8831689 one of the things learned from rita is that we have more advanced planning better communications and people are taking these storms a lot more seriously than we did in the past
8831690 trust me as soon as they even mention we start looking at it we watch everything down there and try to react as best we can each day
8831691 we are working toward a full evacuation of shell operated assets in the gulf
8831692 we expect to evacuate the remaining 600 personnel on friday and saturday
8831693 the process is comparable to a trip wire if it takes a plant 36 hours to empty its tanks of inventory and fill them with water and if the plant is in the storm arc 36 5 hours out shutdown procedures are enacted
8831694 these kinds of events are different just about every time and new variables can arise from the uncertainties that come with each storm
8831695 were better prepared to handle a catastrophe from an insurance point of view
8831696 there are just a whole lot of little parts to this situation that i am better prepared to handle
8831697 you are never prepared for a catastrophic event but we are better prepared
8831698 people think that if they survived katrina they can survive anything maybe maybe not
8831699 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8831700 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us
8831701 it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8831702 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families
8831703 because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8831704 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8831705 stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8831706 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of in this country
8831707 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8831708 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8831709 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own

8831720 google will now be forcing users into high volume high money terms i e terms that people are bidding on via adsense its almost like google is creating a new top 10 before the user is ever even taken to the serps by having your primary keywords that you are ranking for listed in this drop down you are far more likely to get traffic than those related terms that arent being listed when presented with options people will generally choose one
8831721 those who make their way into the suggest feature get a
8831722 those of us who believe in doing long tail marketing may find an decrease down the tail from search and a greater need to develop segments of our site to serve those long tail queries
8831723 if your tradename is offered in google suggest results and youve filed a trademark complaint form the results page will be free from paid competition giving you a better shot at the traffic through organic or ppc links
8831724 with google suggest constantly popping up when you go about your daily queries many who never really thought of keyphrases will now start to think about them it will be a constant reinforcement of our efforts to think about how consumers search we may have to adjust our planning to meet these enhanced skills
8831725 there are other ways to be more comprehensive but google suggest can help to identify negative keywords you may want to enter in your campaigns and i saw some negative phrases with higher index numbers that never showed up in google keyword tools
8831726 while many of us set up ad groups to capture spelling errors this will have a decreasing impact as people start to use the suggest feature as a live auto correction typo campaigns may get less traffic
8831727 it may become possible to hijack google suggest so that competitive phrases are strategically flashed to the user

8831733 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8831734 they never say were going to cut off your oil because we dont like your foreign policy
8831735 there is a risk that they might do something like cutting oil to hurt the worlds democracies if they get angry enough
8831736 within a decade it will be very hard for russia to push us around

8831750 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8831751 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
8831752 h ow are things going at the democratic party national convention in denver this week
8831753 the debts of governments federal state and local corporations farmers home mortgages and consumer commercial and financial debts
8831754 the consistency of the pattern suggests that some imperative is at work something that requires debt to increase
8831755 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
8831756 the most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from georgia james jackson on february 9 1790 in which he predicted that adoption of hamiltons funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt
8831757 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
8831758 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
8831759 we are buying more and more in the same amount of time witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales storage units and big trash pickup days and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills while two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water food and shelter americans throw away their microwave ovens televisions computers refrigerators furniture and cars meanwhile acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity its like arguing that cancer is good because it grows
8831760 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money
8831761 congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt free and interest free
8831762 this is a crucial time things are happening we have got some key media people talking and writing about our kind of reforms the inertia is starting to yield things are starting to roll the worsening conditions in 2009 will give us a once in a lifetime chance to be heard above the propaganda
8831763 more and more people are realising that green taxes have nothing to do with being green theyre just an excuse to tax us more
8831764 theyve got more to do with a greedy government that is trying to fill a black hole in its finances
8831765 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed families and businesses
8831766 with the credit crunch squeezing budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust
8831767 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8831768 people pay for electricity motor fuel and other goods subject to green taxes with income that has already been taxed companies that pay green taxes also pay corporation tax and most green taxes are accompanied by vat
8831769 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8831770 my friend mr kouchner also said that we will soon attack moldova and ukraine and the crimea but that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well
8831771 it is striking that no country has supported what russia did on tuesday

8831773 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8831774 created the 23rd of march of 2005 by an accord of the presidents of canada the u s and mexico in waco texas aspan spp constitutes a grave threat to mexican national sovereignty and constitutes an informal process leading to a new international treaty at the margin of the legislative power in both senses aspan spp does violence to the mexican constitutional order
8831775 under the rubric of aspan spp and through working groups led by the mexican secretaries of the interior economy and foreign relations and their counterparts in canada and the u s along with representatives of private corporations of the three countries it has continued advancing in various regulations that later will assume the form of public policies harming the sovereignty of canada and mexico and in the exclusive benefit of the united states and of course of the private corporations regardless of nationality
8831776 the elites of the three nafta countries canada the united states and mexico have been aggressively moving forward to build a new political and economic entity
8831777 the task before civil society in all three countries is enormous citizen organizations must begin a concerted effort to understand the regulations signed to date and their implications in order to fight for their suspension still motives for optimism exist actions implemented under the guise of nafta plus by means of regulations have proceeded unchallenged thus far but their validity lacks treaty status as such modifying or canceling these undemocratic regulations would seem to be within reach of an informed organized and mobilized civil society and hopefully a united trinational civil society
8831778 we mexicans are taking steps toward the integration of our economy military energy and security with the united states
8831779 how can i love my home without coming to realize that other men no less rightly love theirs once you have realized that frenchmen like caf complet just as we like bacon and eggs why good luck to them and let them have it the last thing we want is to make everywhere else just like our own home it would not be home unless it were different

8831823 he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken smitten by god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent so he opened not his mouth by oppression and judgment he was taken away and as for his generation who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living stricken for the transgression of my people and they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death although he had done no violence and there was no deceit in his mouth yet it was the will of the lord to crush him he has put him to grief when his soul makes an offering for sin he shall see his offspring he shall prolong his days the will of the lord shall prosper in his hand out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied by his knowledge shall the righteous one my servant make many to be accounted righteous and he shall bear their iniquities therefore i will divide him a portion with the many and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he poured out his soul to death and was numbered with the transgressors yet he bore the sin of many and makes intercession for the transgressors
8831824 what do you think about that who is it talking about

8831861 there were two things that turned off voters in the recent by elections one was the sodomy allegations and the other was the playing up of racial sentiments the twin attacks on anwar did not hold water they actually backfired
8831862 the people are becoming more and more politically informed thanks to the alternative media there is an intellectual gap between barisan nasional governments and the peoples mohammad agus added they are insulting the intellectual voters by trying to use the media to play up their stories the bn governments thinking gap is far from the peoples their campaign strategy is a failure it is too out dated and it is just not working
8831863 the people want something but the bn gives a different thing those who believed that the bn government would do something to change their lives are probab y upset
8831864 the ruling party could not answer or respond to all the questions put forth by opposition leaders anwars promise of a new hope for malaysia has somehow convinced many even some strong bn supporters
8831865 bn has also lost the confidence of the malays and non malays especially among the middle class group it failed to understand the peoples grievances and that is how they become silent voters
8831866 i am not denying that the bn government has contributed a lot in the past but the present leadership has failed to address the rakyats grievances

8831881 there are three ways humor and laughter help us when life gets bumpy
8831882 the first is that humor gives us perspective and changes the way we see the world
8831883 serious illness is not funny death and dying are not funny but funny things happen in those situations
8831884 i do at my age my back goes out more than i do
8831885 humor is all around you just have to look for it
8831886 it wasnt easy i made gratitude lists read norman cousins fell totally and unexpectedly in love with a good friend hes got a wicked sense of humor and so do i ive never laughed so hard in my life
8831887 when youre told you have a year to live and that youll die an extremely painful death you have two choices you can either prepare to die or you can say oh hell might as well have the best time i can with what i have left for me laughter tipped the balance
8831888 i truly believe a positive attitude helped save my life
8831889 you must give up the constant fussing about things you can do nothing about so you learn to see the small funny things about them
8831890 give yourself a shot in the arm with whatever tickles your funny bone
8831891 humor and laughter arent substitutes for medical care but they can be adjuncts humor can be a tremendous liberating source for coping in tough times
8831892 mom you know according to statistics im supposed to be dead in a month
8831893 well i guess you better hold your breath if youre going to make that deadline
8831894 i think maybe black humor is a form of bravado and also a release for the buildup of painful emotions
8831895 you are the first teacher not to call me anal
8831896 i am a character in my own self and my life is my very own book
8831897 i am not chinese i am not indian i am not malay altogether we are malaysians
8831898 shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent state founded upon the principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of its people and the maintenance of a just peace among all nations
8831899 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8831900 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8831901 we all die its just a matter of how and why
8831902 the number of newborn infants totaled 35 400 in june down 1 800 or 4 8 percent from the same period a year earlier in the first half a total of 240 700 babies were born compared with 244 400 a year before
8831903 2002 births to mothers aged 15 19 per 1000 women aged 15 19 in oecd countries
8831904 the social construction and contradiction in the mothering of working class women
8831905 previous statistical association s between high fertility catholicism and traditional family values
8831906 khairy jamaluddin declared that umno had gone to permatang pauh to bury anwar
8831907 we can have a dialogue with the component parties but what else can we do that is what we should be asking ourselves
8831908 the format in umno and bn is not right and change should not just be in the form but also in the content
8831909 umno also cannot stand alone there are weaknesses within umno but weaknesses also exist within the component parties
8831910 this means business as usual for another two years for the rakyat they feel it is too much to swallow
8831911 jengoi kat kepala aku jeng jeng aku pon buat la pengat pisang aku makan sorang apa kesah aku masak apa pon okela just wanna shared wif all of u da recipe

8831956 the republicans going to make a mockery of the fraud general election campaign let the fun begin
8831957 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8831958 it is clear from the response you are seeing that this audience clearly feels that this is the man and this speech has met the challenge of this venue and this speech was all that he wanted it to be
8831959 vote for him or do not but take pride that this nation can produce men and speakers such as that for 42 minutes not a sour note and spell binding throughout in a way usually reserved for the creations of fiction
8831960 i thought it was an exceedingly smart speech in which barack obama played both offense and defense very effectively
8831961 what you heard was very down there plain spoken no bs if you will
8831962 it was a great way of throwing back the best shot and saying the other side is full of crap ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8831963 i think someone may have put some obama koolaid into my water here i thought it was great

8831968 what is the real reason i dont like barack obama
8831969 they said the same thing about me and look how that turned out
8831970 we elected an idiot george bush for president why would we not elect a black man
8831971 lou dobbs here with kitty pilgrim reporting from the bluecon convention obama has just finished his speech the crowd is loud i hear more boos than cheers dont you kitty

8831974 lou its kitty here the convention floor is now in chaos obama supporters are screaming and fainting hillary supporters are cheering and yelling no obamanation no obamanation what a convention i see that theyre frog marching obama off stage now howard dean donna brazille and nancy pelosi are trying to make a run for it wait the secret service has them in custody now too

8831978 if john mccain wants to debate bla bla bla thats a debate im ready to have
8831979 senator obama you mention that if mccain wants to debate im ready to have that debate
8831980 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy
8831981 hey get me that unity pony now i need that unity pony
8831982 there must be something wrong with the unity pony that gallup just doesnt look right
8831983 i want you to ask yourselves were you in the campaign just for me
8831984 if you dont have fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters
8831985 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8831986 this election is not about me it is about you
8831987 the change we need doesnt come from washington it comes to washington
8831988 if it takes a democratic party defeat for president to rid the party of the elements that so corrupted the process and everything the democraticn party has stood for so be it
8831989 america we cannot turn back at this moment in this election
8831990 how he can he pay for all those things he said he can deliver if he cuts taxes as he has also promised
8831991 again he barack obama carries with him the history of tonight and its important to point out as we have not so far barack obama was not given this nomination he won it he was not offered a nice title like secretary of state like condoleezza rice got from the republicans he was not offered the title of chairman of the joint chiefs as colin powell was or secretary of state he won the nomination of a democratic party voting together he defeated all other opponents and took the prize and took the leadership he is the chosen leader of the democratic party he is not some popular appointment or a showcase appointment he is the victor here tonight thats why he dictates the agenda thats why he says personally what the democratic party will do if hes elected president he is the leader of the party he may be the leader of the country through a democratic process it is so vital to understand the history being made here tonight this is not something cute or wonderful it is something compelling and powerful this country has changed its history
8831992 fox says this speech will not build bridges it will sic repub attack dogs on barky
8831993 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain barack obama is still not ready to be president
8831994 hes an american and he is going to know what that means
8831995 mccain says hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8831996 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8831997 america our work will not be easy the challenges we face require tough choices and democrats as well as republicans will need to cast off the worn out ideas and politics of the past
8831998 you think about everything from campaign finance to immigration and on and theres john mccain working across party lines senator obama doesnt have a record now he can make the claim and he can hold himself up as pure and trying to reach to a new generation of post partisan politics but he has to do so largely based on rhetoric and wishful thinking because he doesnt have the record
8831999 there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically
8832000 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are nothing so far in his life approaches mccains decision to refuse repatriation as a pow so as to deny his jailors a propaganda coup in fact there is scant evidence the illinois senator takes positions that challenge his base or otherwise threaten him politically thats why his reversal on campaign financing and his transparently false justification of it matter more than similar acts by mccain
8832001 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
8832002 his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8832003 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
8832004 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
8832005 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8832006 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8832007 for a couple of days theyve been saying you voted to raise taxes something like 94 times that seems to be the drumbeat thats going to happen during this campaign are you going to raise taxes in a big way for average americans
8832008 i mean this is the standard fare of politics and the truth of the matter is that the only bills that i voted for for the most part since ive been in the senate were introduced by republicans with george bush you know they were the majority for a big chunk of the time i was there
8832009 finally the obama people are too convinced that they can define mccain as bush iii the case is just factually inaccurate mccain will be able to pull out dozens of instances from torture to global warming to spending in which he broke with his party as rush limbaugh will tell you
8832010 as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq
8832011 in early november 2003 at a time when fred dalton thompson was playing a tough d a on law and order john mccain was cross examining donald rumsfeld for real on capitol hill it was still very early into the u s occupation of iraq but the as yet unacknowledged by rummy that is insurgency was already out of control alone among his fellow gop senators mccain blasted rumsfeld for not putting enough u s troops on the ground and for resorting too soon to iraqification that is transferring security to ill prepared iraqi forces in an extraordinarily blunt speech at the council on foreign relations that grim autumn mccain warned that ultimately iraq could become another vietnam if we lose popular support in the united states the next day the secretary of defense asked mccain to breakfast i read y our speech harrumphed rumsfeld that must have been an enjoyable experience for him mccain later joked to me then rummy patiently explained to his fellow republican why he and his top civilian brass paul wolfowitz doug feith and the usual crowd of incompetents would continue to do things the same way they believed there was no need for additional troops mccain later related mccain had already realized that rumsfeld was a lost cause the real question the senator suggested to me back then was whether george w bush himself would push rummy to make changes id like to see the president fully engaged mccain said bush needed to be on top of more details of whats going on as we now know nearly four years later mccain was dead on in his analysis of what went wrong in iraq right down to the need for bush to get engaged and fire rumsfeld mccain was so right that among military experts today the emerging conventional wisdom about bushs current surg e is that if it had occurred back then when mccain wanted it and the political will existed in this country to support it for the necessary number of years it might well have succeeded
8832012 widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush
8832013 on global warming mccain is widely acknowledged to have charted a course independent of bush immediately after the 2004 election in which he stumped for bushs re election he sharply distanced himself from bush on climate change calling the administrations stance terribly disappointing mccain had co sponsored a bill with sen joe lieberman to curb greenhouse gases in 2003 bush had opposed any such move citing possible harm to the economy and doubts over global warming
8832014 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president he said that the fundamentals of the e conomy are strong
8832015 the second and third quotes the obama campaign uses from mccain are more misleading the ad shows mccain saying t heres been great progress economically the quote comes from an interview mccain did with peter cook at bloomberg television in april mccain was making a case for what he believed were positive economic developments during bushs time in office however the fuller quote shows mccain was saying that whatever progress had been made it wouldnt be enough to comfort families facing these tremendous economic challenges his comments overall are pessimistic he cites challenging times and enormous difficulties the obama campaign distorts his views by using just a snippet of his remarks
8832016 im going to ask you a version of the ronald reagan question you think if americans were asked are you better off today than you were before george bush took office more than seven years ago what answer would they give
8832017 certainly in this time we are in very challenging times
8832018 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera yo u could make an argument that theres been great progress economically over that period of time but thats no comfort thats no comfort to families now that are facing these tremendous economic challenges but let me just add peter the fundamentals of americas economy are strong were the greatest exporter the greatest importer the greatest innovator the greatest producer still the greatest economic engine in the world and by the way exports and free trade are a key element in economic recovery but these are tough times tough times and nobody knows that more than american families including in small towns of pennsylvania they havent lost their fundamental religious beliefs their respect for the constitution their right to bear arms they are still keep america as a beacon of hope and freedom throughout the world
8832019 he knows how to twist with the best of them
8832020 although obama gets substantial mileage out of running against politics as usual he provided a reminder on friday that he knows how to twist with the best of them
8832021 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy
8832022 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
8832023 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
8832024 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
8832025 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
8832026 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
8832027 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
8832028 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
8832029 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
8832030 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
8832031 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8832032 the latest additions to sen barack obamas energy plan outlined during an appearance in lansing monday may win the democratic presidential candidate some votes from disgruntled consumers in november but theyll do nothing to answer the nations long term needs
8832033 when his presumptive republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz proposed a gas tax holiday as a way to reduce the high cost of driving mr obama showed political courage and intellectual honesty by refusing to sign on to that obvious gimmick its an idea to get them through an election mr obama said now he has two such gimmicks of his own
8832034 the politics may have changed but the facts havent the accuracy of sen mccains original position has not changed offshore drilling would not lower gas prices today it would not lower gas prices next year and it would not lower gas prices five years from now
8832035 i think john mccains proposal for a three month tax holiday is a bad idea
8832036 in this campaign john mccain is offering the same old gimmicks that will provide almost no short term relief to folks who are struggling with high gas prices gimmicks that will only increase our addiction for another four years
8832037 that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than guess where right here in nevada at yucca mountain
8832038 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
8832039 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
8832040 but to add a five year tax increase on top of that to pay for a one year gift to voters would indeed increase the cost of doing business that cost would be passed along in forgone investment in new production lower dividends for pension funds and other shareholders and higher prices at the pump thus socking it to the consumers whom the plan is supposed to help if oil prices fall there might be no windfall profits to tax then the obama rebate would have to be paid for through spending cuts taxes on something else or borrowing
8832041 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families
8832042 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standar d deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
8832043 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
8832044 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
8832045 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
8832046 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had

8832275 i just wanted to finish each race so to finish in the top five was very rewarding
8832276 i felt the pain about half way through the first day in san francisco
8832277 the doctor said my right arm was filling up with blood i took a week off and had to ice it
8832278 we are hoping to get a lot of good things going with the team
8832279 as one of the captains i hope to set a good example last year was not our best year as a team but it was a good learning experience

8832288 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8832289 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8832290 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8832291 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8832292 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8832293 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8832294 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8832295 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8832296 who are open to doing something on the production side
8832297 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8832298 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8832299 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8832300 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8832301 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8832302 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8832303 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8832304 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8832305 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8832306 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8832307 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8832308 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8832309 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8832310 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8832311 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8832312 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8832313 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8832314 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8832315 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8832316 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8832317 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8832318 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8832319 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8832320 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

8832323 in addition to helping my mom recover her senses i received a phone call from hrc human rights campaign
8832324 barack obamas speech tonight laid out his specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8832325 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain four more years of the same failed policies or a leader who can tackle the great challenges we face revitalizing our economy and restoring our standing in the world i am proud to support senator obama our next president of the united states and joe biden our next vice president of the united states
8832326 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8832327 it went a little long it started to feel like a half time at the superbowl
8832328 i want you to ask yourselves were you in the campaign just for me
8832329 he wont even follow him into the cave where he lives
8832330 oh lawd fox is already moving on guessing mccains vp frank idiot extraordinaire luntz however loved the speech
8832331 will have nowhere else to go short of pre emptive strikes against irans nuclear facilities
8832332 if we had some eggs we could have ham and eggs if we had some ham
8832333 keep the americans in the germans down and the russians out
8832334 i would have thought obamabots would be satisfied with the whole anti mccain tenor of the speech
8832335 will put the interests of black americans ahead of other americans
8832336 theres not a black america and white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
8832337 most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8832338 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8832339 i watch with amazement as he came to the senate i watch with amazement
8832340 made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the worlds deadliest weapons
8832341 to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8832342 but i was proudest i was proudest when i watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of americas wounded warriors at walter reed army hospital
8832343 what hes done in the united states senate fighting to ensure that the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care including mental health care
8832344 the obama national headquarters is just down the street from here they obviously have the time to send out these angry emails but they cant walk a few blocks to our studios
8832345 the first black presidential nominee ever of a major party in history
8832346 the first black presidential nominee ever of a major party in history
8832347 however he does make a good point mccain definitely has a record that shows him being opposite bush on many issues
8832348 sen obama this is truly a good day for america how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8832349 the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin
8832350 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8832351 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
8832352 the palpable apprehension is that the anointed is a stranger a deeply engaging elegant brilliant stranger with whom the democrats had a torrid affair having slowly woken up they see the ring and wonder who exactly they married last night
8832353 every four years the democrats send us another governor we have to get to know
8832354 is why the party that dominates congress has to keep putting up unknowns to contest the worlds most powerful political office
8832355 come to grips at the presidential level with more democratic mystery
8832356 in dozens of interviews his friends said they could not remember his specific views from that era beyond a general emphasis on diversity and social and economic justice
8832357 the way barack michelle joe and jill walked off the hokey stage with the swelling music and the fireworks was i watching some kind of galactic enterprise
8832358 he could do the basics but anything else he just couldnt progress
8832359 he knew what to say like cup or juice or dog but he just couldnt verbalize it
8832360 sometimes it would be like he speaks but his mouth doesnt even open
8832361 we got to understanding it but for others it would just be like him humming something
8832362 were in our seventh year at the lynnwood location and were assisting between 200 and 250 students right now
8832363 we use three to four classrooms and also do everything to provide one on one assistance for the kids
8832364 we prefer to use the classrooms as a starting point and go from there to give a more meaningful experience
8832365 a lot of what we do isnt just sit with a pencil and paper we encourage a more hands on approach many more fun opportunities
8832366 the basis of it all is in federal law we must provide for children with disabilities
8832367 i think this program started in the mid 70s at the maplewood center and if i recall the district started the program before federal law required it

8832372 first off is education education is really important to me
8832373 thats no 1 and then also how comfortable i feel with the coaching staff the players and the city im living in
8832374 thats why i want to stay close to home i dont want to have my mom and dad traveling so far to see me i want an easier commute for them
8832375 im shooting more for the defense i just feel more comfortable id rather give hits than take hits thats what it comes down to
8832376 i know what kind of a role i should play this year ive been a captain once so i know what kind of a player i have to be on and off the field both i have to set a great example at all times for the rest of my teammates
8832377 weve been to the semifinals two years now so thats always a goal
8832378 its my last year in high school senior season id rather go out with a big bang and finish it off
8832379 i like to stay active i like to stay in shape basketball is a good sport to play its good conditioning i think i might do track and field this year just to get faster

8832384 as we have said in the past we dont think the wasl is going to be a serious graduation barrier for students
8832385 the greater barrier appears to be credits earned in high school
8832386 i am very pleased to see that students are continuing the momentum set last year by the historic class of 2008
8832387 we know theres still plenty of hard work ahead but these results are very encouraging to me we know students are more than capable of meeting these new graduation requirements which are critical for success later in life
8832388 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8832389 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8832390 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8832391 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8832392 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8832393 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8832394 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8832395 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8832418 there is that concern but i think many of our families see what were doing here
8832419 im pretty confident we wont have a lot of families leaving
8832420 they want to support their children as much as they can but sometimes theyre working two jobs
8832421 we want to make changes so students will continue to progress

8832437 we have listened to what the union said on pensions
8832438 we should have started with the existing contract and moved forward
8832439 were committed to giving a better driving experience for everyone
8832440 the whole system is coordinated to give the best possible outcomes to traffic flow
8832441 in the old days wed have to send technicians out to the controller boxes
8832442 i would say the city of lynnwoods traffic sensor configuration is the best in the united states
8832443 since we founded this lab in 2003 weve gotten very strong support from the city of lynnwood
8832444 and weve found a starting point to integrate our research
8832445 for example you can always manually verify if this data is correct
8832446 we really do want the feed back from people if they do have an isolated or ongoing experience wed like to hear from them
8832447 there is so much more music to be made here in hawaii
8832448 and im sure to make it happen if at all possible
8832449 individual spirit of aloha through hula and all things hawaiian and to use our love of hula and the hawaiian culture to educate others of our lifestyle and rich traditions
8832450 no hay el personal suficiente y por eso es mejor no invertirle al proceso y dejar sin vigilancia esos lugares
8832451 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8832452 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8832453 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8832454 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8832455 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8832456 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8832457 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8832458 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8832459 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8832460 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8832461 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8832462 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8832463 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8832464 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8832465 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8832466 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8832467 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8832468 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8832469 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8832470 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8832473 that old clich bad day at the office doesnt apply here its worse
8832474 ive seen this movie and no its not called the longest day either
8832475 its a day that just happens in cricket every nick and every feather is taken you may get the odd rough one as johan botha seemingly did and you just have to forget it as quickly as you can
8832476 we didnt read the pitch very well yes but this wasnt an 83 all out pitch there arent many 83 pitches in the world actually
8832477 we said we needed to lift our intensity at trent bridge and we didnt
8832478 hmm theres a bit of attitude to sort out here
8832479 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8832480 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8832481 it is difficult to determine the duration of the trial considering the postponements and other interlocutory proceedings which might arise
8832482 you are not going to behave like the leaders of a faction
8832483 why do we put the scriptures on such a pedestal why do we say it is inerrant why do we say it has absolute authority
8832484 to be able to walk alongside him and listen to him and learn from him
8832485 in what way is it better on this side of the watershed
8832486 the holy spirit will be able to come if he leaves
8832487 you and i are left with the apostolic witness because of the coming of the holy spirit
8832488 well the old testament you know is very shaky the new testament well the epistles and so on well secondary it was written by somebody else but the gospels are about jesus thats what we focus on
8832489 well the epistles i dont know about that but the gospels this ethic jesus teachings
8832490 jesus seems to be the key character maybe even god lets give extra weight to what he said and did
8832491 maybe jesus didnt actually say that bit because it is not in the early manuscripts
8832492 this profound watershed event of the coming of the spirit
8832493 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8832494 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8832495 we will be disappointed if the parties renege on their commuitment
8832496 that all zimbabwe stakeholders should go and sit and finalise all outstanding issues which will pave the way for establishing a stable and peaceful government
8832497 to me the most exciting medium in the world right now is games because its so inventive it seems to me that every other medium is worried
8832498 oh we dont have to explain or show how he got there well just have him tell you
8832499 whats going to happen to us are we still relevant do people still want us
8832500 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8832501 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8832502 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8832503 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8832504 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8832505 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8832506 it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8832507 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8832508 wir m chten den gl ubigen christen in sterreich eine politische stimme geben
8832509 wir wollen da die sterreichische republik wieder durch eine monarchie ersetzt wird
8832510 south africa have got one more shot at it in this years tri nations
8832511 if they can take it the match they can park the rest of the tournament and move forward a lot more positively towards their end of season tour preparations
8832512 ask yourself how youd feel in their position theres no doubt theyll be up for it
8832513 we need to win this match for south africa for the coaching staff and all involved with the springboks
8832514 one thing we dont want is to get together for the end of season tour to europe and still be asking ourselves questions about where we are and what were doing wrong we also need to regain our confidence
8832515 i know what these guys are capable of and what they can do on the field i hope and pray that that breakthrough happens this weekend
8832516 the guys must simply accept the responsibility that goes with the rugby we want to play and thats making the right decisions and playing what is in front of them
8832517 both in terms of momentum for the rest of the tri nations but also as far as the development of the group is concerned
8832518 a fall from the third floor hurts as much as a fall from the hundredth if i have to fall may it be from a high place
8832519 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington

8832541 his chief of staff took the phone call and was informed by inpex they had made their decision on the site of the gas project that they were developing

8832559 our diverse member companies transport the vast majority of the containerized cargo moving throughout north america and overseas and much of this freight flows through the ports of los angeles and long beach the potential for the concession plans to adversely impact transportation movements is too great for iana to remain silent on this issue

8833054 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
8833055 i was arrested at work in front of colleagues and customers it was awful
8833056 im livid she should never have got away with it she should have been put inside it was vicious and vindictive and the sentence has made a mockery out of the justice system it sends the message that false accusers can get away with it

8833058 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8833059 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8833060 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8833061 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8833062 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8833063 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8833064 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8833065 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed

8833067 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8833068 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8833069 women are discriminated against widely for a variety of reasons and until those reasons are addressed the problem will remain for instance look at the laws such as the inheritance law property law and land and land units law they are all biased towards men
8833070 the idea behind this initiative is to use the religious sentiment to make people change their mindset against the girl child where laws have failed to curb the heinous crime of female foeticide this sentiment will hopefully work
8833071 until laws which are biased towards men are not changed it will be difficult to change the negative trend of female foeticide
8833072 finally it is a clear fact that our goodwill has gotten us to the point where our enemies are making a mockery of us
8833073 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it
8833074 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8833075 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8833076 our children have dramatically different life chances depending on where they were born in japan or sweden they can expect to live more than 80 years in brazil 72 years india 63 years and in one of several african countries fewer than 50 years
8833077 some low income countries such as cuba costa rica china state of kerala in india and sri lanka have achieved levels of good health despite relatively low national incomes
8833078 the report suggests avenues for action from the local to national and global levels policy makers health officials grassroot activists and their community based organizations have eagerly awaited it
8833079 much of the research and evidence is of particular relevance to the southeast asian region where too many people struggle daily for justice and equity in health the report will inspire the region to act and develop new policies and programmes
8833080 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives
8833081 hindu and christian peace committees have been meeting and the leaders have appealed for calm
8833082 but it helps them become good citizens that was the way i was taught when i was a child its not abuse i love my grandchildren how could i abuse them
8833083 but the statistics are just the tip of the iceberg
8833084 if an adult hits a child no one reports this to the relevant authorities
8833085 that would only happen if a child was badly injured then the police would come in but they would just handle the case by charging the parent with creating disorder or making loud sounds rather than child abuse
8833086 if you slap a child that violates the law but no one reports that
8833087 these are seen as normal acts according to the law one has to have 11 percent of the body injured to make it a criminal case
8833088 many people have no idea that boys can be sexually abused
8833089 they dont imagine what kind of abuse that could be so they never think that boys need to be protected
8833090 i only hit my son to teach him to become a good man of course there are limitations you cannot beat a kid too hard
8833091 its really a challenge to raise awareness among people its tradition
8833092 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves everyone is subjected to the law even websites and blogs
8833093 rumah ini milik abdul qodir jaelani tidak ada satu iblis pun boleh merampas
8833094 kan tidak cuma harta aja yang digono ghini tapi juga utang digono gini
8833095 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8833096 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8833097 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8833098 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8833099 no one works for someone we all just work together
8833100 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8833101 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8833102 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8833103 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8833104 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8833105 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8833106 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8833107 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8833108 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8833109 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8833110 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8833111 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8833112 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8833113 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8833114 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8833115 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done
8833116 this is tangency we flogged common sense to pay our pie bill a couple years back
8833117 this is the largest investigation to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
8833118 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age
8833119 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someone s antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer
8833120 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer
8833121 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8833122 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8833123 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8833124 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8833125 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8833126 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8833127 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8833128 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8833129 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8833130 prior studies have indicated reduced bone density in hiv infected patients but little was known whether fracture risk increased in this population
8833131 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8833132 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures
8833133 we talked about solving the problem of floods and related problems faced by nepal pranab mukherjee said the indian government will help us in that
8833134 terrorism is an issue on which we are together we believe that this is a menace that has to be addressed we have agreed to cooperate on this in fact we are going to have home secretary level meetings a day after tomorrow
8833135 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases
8833136 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8833137 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8833138 the results are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars
8833139 because of the role hls5 plays in keeping cell growth at a normal rate we expect that these compounds will greatly slow down the growth of cancer cells this discovery is very encouraging and a great step forward in our quest to create new cancer treatments
8833140 our preliminary data reveals that several of these compounds do indeed markedly slow down the growth of human cancer cells
8833141 importantly we also know through computer modelling that nearly all of these compounds have drug like qualities
8833142 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8833143 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8833144 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8833145 finally it is a clear fact that our goodwill has gotten us to the point where our enemies are making a mockery of us
8833146 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8833147 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8833148 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8833149 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8833150 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8833151 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8833152 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8833153 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8833154 i wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what you rarely win but sometimes you do
8833155 can russia guarantee that such actions wouldnt be made in other countries
8833156 at this time i was im beijing as you know and i had a chance
8833157 so what we should allow to kill us but in exchange of it to save place in g8 but who will be presented at g8 if all of us will be killed we talked with you about possible threat from russia you and me we sit now and peacefully talking in the city of sochi at several hundred kilometers from here american army ships have arrived with missles on board the distance of firing is exactly several hundred kilometers its not our ships came to your shores but your ships came to our shores so what choice do we have we dont need any complications we dont want to argue with anybody to fight with anybody we want partnership and respecting us and our interests
8833158 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8833159 we tried everything in the end we rolled the car back pushed it and finally got it going it had nothing to do with tactics
8833160 i dont know what was wrong but seb really did seem to have a problem
8833161 so tomorrow it looks like ill be first car on the road okay it wont be easy but weve found a good rhythm today so well see what we can do
8833162 i think third place is better than second but well see how we get on tomorrow

8833183 when reporters contact us we always ask to accompany them we know the
8833184 we would never allow a young female adventurer in this wood especially not at night on tuesday we did not receive any requests for assistance and nor did any other charities

8833192 saya juga berterima kasih kepada setiap orang yang selama ini mendukung
8833193 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8833194 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8833195 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8833196 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8833197 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8833198 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8833199 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8833200 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8833201 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8833202 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8833203 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8833204 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8833205 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8833206 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8833207 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8833208 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8833209 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8833210 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8833211 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8833212 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8833213 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8833214 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8833215 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8833216 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8833217 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8833218 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8833219 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8833220 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8833221 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8833222 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8833223 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8833224 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8833225 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8833226 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8833227 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8833228 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8833229 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8833230 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8833231 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8833232 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8833233 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8833234 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8833235 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8833236 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8833237 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8833238 we also think that it is right to continue guarantor status and we are insisted on it
8833239 not only turkey but also greece is the guarantor in the island this is an international agreement
8833240 on the other hand we will continue to fulfill our historical responsibility for the progress of cyprus and peace and prosperity of turkish cypriot people
8833241 i hope september 3 process will assist solution of the problem
8833242 a turkish cypriot constituent state and a greek cypriot constituent state with political equality
8833243 a turkish cypriot constituent state and a greek cypriot constituent state with political equality
8833244 im definitely in favor of the 18 game schedule and i think it will happen at some point in the future we know with the offseason conditioning programs and mini camps unlike in the past the players come to camp more ready to play sooner and it could be set up where teams have several practices with other teams as we did a couple of weeks ago with dallas
8833245 they could only accept one person from the state of wyoming and my test didnt measure up to some guys who was really smart
8833246 we were aware that there were only seven blacks on the campus five boys and two girls
8833247 we heard that they were going to drop us because we were not good enough we were too small for them
8833248 tuffy was a true blue ram fort collins all the way
8833249 that was the only game in my whole life i didnt play
8833250 i probably shouldnt have played the rest of the season but i did and not well by the way
8833251 it was a huge hole i was untouched and i outran everybody
8833252 we had worked on a two point play with him running it so he came in
8833253 wed worked on that darned play all week we were pretty sure they wouldnt cover the back on a pass we just hooked wayne schneider about a foot in the end zone and they didnt cover him
8833254 i remember the sadness how we had battled all game and lost
8833255 we had gotten off to such a great start that season we had some injuries and we just didnt play with the same focus
8833256 we just couldnt get anything going we kind of went flat after the oklahoma game
8833257 i remember waking up the next morning and seeing the paper
8833258 when theyll meet on the gridiron again remains a question for the future perhaps a good many years away who knows
8833259 i think i know our players better and what they have to do here on top of playing football
8833260 it amazes me sometimes how they can balance all they have to do academically and still find time to play football
8833261 were no more pessimistic about him today than we were
8833262 but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind
8833263 and you have to have the same flexibility on defense
8833264 in the past maybe you didnt see the spread but in the past maybe you did some teams run the wishbone or the veer the wing t
8833265 these are all parts of whats going on now they are all kind of coming together and the offensive guys have figured out how to take a little bit of that a little bit of that a little bit of that and it works so watch video of csu tight end kory sperry watch video of csu football scrimmage and interview with coach steve fairchild visit natalie meislers all things rams blog for a behind the scenes look at csu sports play pickem for the upcoming csu football game in the past maybe you saw a little less sophistication and diversity than you do now
8833266 a lot of them are dropping eight guys they dont want the receivers to get behind them
8833267 i contacted a lot of defensive coordinators around the country and asked them what drove them crazy the spread came up over and over
8833268 but a lot more of that stuff up front really made the offense protect and secure itself or live with a few things and put it on the quarterback
8833269 its part of who we are its part of our mentality we want to continue to stay in that direction
8833270 you might give up a little size these days for speed because of the fact that so much of it is a spread type of game you need guys that can play in space you still need that big strong guy inside but youre looking at some teams playing with a smaller faster defensive ends than theyve had in the past linebackers might be smaller but faster
8833271 just the versatility factor both from a formation standpoint and from an athlete standpoint changes it
8833272 i think you look around the country and theres less and less i back teams theres less offset i teams with a true fullback i think you would also prefer a little bit taller guy a little bit more athletic guy that can do those things as well as be a downfield threat in the passing game
8833273 things go in cycles in football offensive formations offensive plays defensive formations defensive plays
8833274 its just a fun part of the game to see where people are going to take certain aspects of how they play the game and how other people adjust
8833275 sure a man is nothing when confronted by the power of the almighty
8833276 what are we going to do without brandon marshall just win baby
8833277 its unfortunate whenever you dont have your best player on offense for the first two games
8833278 but at the same time it gives other guys a chance to step up weve been working just as hard as brandon all summer and through the offseason well keep rolling
8833279 guys have been fighting for opportunities just for a moment in time a chance to make a play a chance to be that guy it brings opportunity it brings motivation it brings everything you want out of a competitive athlete playing on the biggest stage
8833280 im not going to speak out about it too much because its pretty obvious but best believe my mind set is to go out and get what i can get
8833281 keep the chains moving keep the clock going and protect the football
8833282 but i think we need to have the mind set of hes hurt and when guys get hurt other guys have to step up and make plays thats how it works in the nfl
8833283 i should get an opportunity to get a couple catches under our belt great opportunity to play on monday night and for the franchise to come out after going 7 9 last year to show the league that were for real and make everybody proud of us
8833284 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8833285 john mccain likes to say he will follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8833286 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgement to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8833287 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy thats his choice but it is not the change we need
8833288 i got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8833289 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8833290 americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in commonality
8833291 dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
8833292 just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8833293 hear a young preacher from georgia speak of his dream the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustrations of so many dreams deferred but what the people heard instead people from every creed and color people from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one we cannot walk alone the preacher cried and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess thank you and god bless you and god bless america
8833294 it was a long summer obviously with a lot of things to think about
8833295 im excited with the decision i made looking forward to the start of the season and getting on the ice im going to start skating friday the body and mind are fresh and ready to go and im excited about it
8833296 it was a frustrating year with the injury three months of rehab wasnt a lot of fun at that point i was contemplating what i wanted to do and it took longer than i thought im happy i took the time i needed to come to this decision
8833297 no deb and the kids were supportive whichever way it went except for mitchell he demanded i play hes the one who just demanded i had the final vote
8833298 what the food bank does for the community keeps growing
8833299 theres 185 000 children who are in need of food and this tournament right here we provide one million meals for them half of those kids are under 5 they cant support themselves and its important that we give back support the cause and try to provide nutrition for them
8833300 they have really helped me i use them all the time it helps me with my hitting mechanics
8833301 hes just focusing on hitting the ball hard and when thats your primary focus good things usually happen
8833302 hes going to have a lot of success with that approach
8833303 i dont know if i will be able to hit in the batting cage three times before the game i would like to feel well enough to try that but i am not sure if that will be possible
8833304 with clavijo gone that has a big part to do with it not meaning as much
8833305 we do have an owner that really cares about us and we see him on a regular basis it gives you an extra incentive to do well for him and win
8833306 thats not bad on stan its just the way it is in our league right now i think with a lot of teams
8833307 we have to combine that defending with a positive edge so were always being a threat
8833308 we need points so we do actually need to score at some point
8833309 in the history of athletics in this country the rmac is right there at the beginning
8833310 the early college sports history in america centered around the rocky mountain athletic conference
8833311 the thanksgiving day games and some of the other traditional games are fascinating
8833312 people getting on streetcars to get to games it was a neat era
8833313 i can remember a lot of the early shenanigans between student bodies
8833314 the m on the mountain was always a target and anything a little dynamite could loosen up was a good target for the mines students dynamite was a lot easier to get in those days
8833315 the neat thing about the rmac its brought together all the histories of the schools in this state
8833316 there arent very many schools and leagues in the west with as many rivalries and stories
8833317 if you would ask if im playing like a no 1 no
8833318 i dont have it lingering over my head will he get reinstated will he not get reinstated i just have to keep myself out of bad situations like i have been doing the last six or seven months
8833319 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
8833320 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today im doing good man
8833321 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8833322 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8833323 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8833324 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8833325 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8833326 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8833327 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8833328 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8833329 unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it
8833330 adventurers are rich tourists and ebay all wrapped up into one
8833331 18 months down the road and inflation is going to plummet like a rock
8833332 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into recession seems to be misguided
8833333 we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind

8833339 i think chief executive peter storrie has made him a short term contract offer
8833340 if you ask me though i do get the feeling it is not going to happen
8833341 he has had a bad knee but if thats all right hes a good player
8833342 i saw him play against chelsea two or three years ago for barcelona and he was fantastic that night in the middle of the park
8833343 i would hope that the board would join me in taking a look at this
8833344 as teenagers if we start using the library from when were children you continue using it as an adult
8833345 we want youngsters to come out and give the board feedback
8833346 i know that the school board has a student representative
8833347 were of course going to offer the program again next year
8833348 weve made getting the bookmobile up and running a high priority
8833349 staff is training that will be operating the bookmobile we hope to have it operating within the next month or so
8833350 its probably more frustrating to us than to anybody because the details are being hashed out by attorneys and we just are waiting to get a final answer
8833351 notified by letter that the parties had reached a settlement in this matter
8833352 were just trying to figure out whether or not we can get him to qualify for the pension
8833353 were not sure how thats going to work out by next week i would know
8833354 its a very big festival for the size of this town
8833355 there is always a lot of community involvement one place made fish dinners and donated all of the proceeds to the fireworks
8833356 i heard the new motor sports park is huge and wonderful
8833357 i think friday night were going to go to the burnouts there and the demolition derby
8833358 they have had dueling pianos in the past which were very cool
8833359 we have a new parking area this year all free with people movers to take people to and from the festival
8833360 the high school kids have been very excited about it
8833361 if all goes well maybe we can extend this next year
8833362 what worked what didnt work tweak it down less days more days
8833363 i think the kids will be more eager to come back the next week
8833364 i think they wont feel as exhausted at the end of the week
8833365 not everyone wants to get out of bed i like how the schools always trying to utilize every dollar and make it work for everybody
8833366 its not out of the question but i guess at this time we have not discussed it
8833367 if the budget got extra bad wed have to consider it as an option
8833368 so a fun extra break in there will be good in february theyre climbing the walls
8833369 you can only teach kids so much in a day before they shut down
8833370 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it
8833371 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8833372 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8833373 when the surface course was put down almost immediately within days we had delamination
8833374 were fixing it and we intend to get paid to fix it were not in the business of losing money
8833375 siamo qui perch amiamo troppo questo paese per lasciare che i prossimi quattro anni assomiglino ancora agli ultimi otto
8833376 il 4 di novembre dobbiamo alzarci e dire otto anni sono abbastanza
8833377 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8833378 we achieved these results despite a trading environment that is becoming tougher with signs of slowing demand particularly in spain the us and the uk
8833379 consequently our revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 is less certain
8833380 taking some early steps to tighten our cost base in a number of markets nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result for the year at the upper end of market expectations

8833401 to still be in fresno at this juncture of the season is a bit shocking
8833402 i understand this is a transition year and maybe that transition does not involve me
8833403 its who we think going into next year is going to have a chance to help us
8833404 you want a smaller pool of guys because there is only going to be so much playing time within that pool you want an ample amount of time to evaluate them
8833405 just because somebody was in the big leagues or somebody has been here earlier in the year they wont have a free pass to get back up here
8833406 i feel that we all believe we can contribute at the major league level
8833407 weve proven it in previous seasons to sit and dwell on our misfortunes is not going to help us get back to that level
8833408 it cant be easy being in that situation passed up by some other guys and having to wait it out and see what happens in september
8833409 and im not going to sit and play gm im grateful to have had the opportunities that i have had and i believe that ive made the most of them all i can honestly say is that i would love to have the opportunity to play in the major leagues with any team that is willing to allow me that chance whether its the san francisco giants i cant say
8833410 hes been able to command his pitches in lower half of the strike zone better hes commanded his sinker and slider and used his curveball in the right counts it was just a matter of getting his strength and velocity up the key for him was getting back to healthy and trusting his stuff
8833411 im seeing better velocity on his fastball hes using it more i like the way hes pitching hes avoided throwing his breaking ball on all counts and hes using it as a put away pitch instead of trying to get ahead with it his velocity is back up to 93 or 94
8833412 its just consistency at the plate his knowledge of the strike zone has improved a lot hes putting better swings on the baseball just quality at bats thats what were looking for hes driven the ball a lot better this year than last year
8833413 fop just tore up his knee in albuquerque two weeks ago and hes out for the year he had surgery for an acl tear he was making progress he was getting his confidence back and we put him in the rotation for a couple of starts hopefully he continues after he comes back and we see what happens
8833414 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8833415 people maybe have a reason to be angry i dont know
8833416 whats done is done i hope people will choose to get beyond this for the time being and lets focus on the campaign you dont have to forget but i do believe you forgive
8833417 my main focus is the campaign ive made a commitment not to exceed four months
8833418 its a pretty critical time for the united way the staff is ready and prepared for the campaign my job is just to support them

8833447 i as well as all employees of ferrari are extremely saddened by the news of the passing of phil hill a man and a champion who gave so much to ferrari and who has always greatly represented the companys values inside and outside the racing track phil hill raced and won many competitions both with prototype cars like the 24 hours of le mans and the 12 hours of sebring won three times each as well as with f1 single seaters with our car phil won the formula one championship title in 1961 as the first american born to reach this result phil and i have always kept in touch throughout the years and i know i will miss his passion and love for ferrari very much my deepest sympathies are with his wife alma and son derek in this sad moment
8833448 youve got a lot of adrenaline you always want to be in that spot to be able to drive in the winning run so i just have fun with it and try to stay as relaxed as i can
8833449 its amazing that it was as long as it was
8833450 yeah its nice to win two in a row but the goals not to win two in a row the goals to win a lot more than that
8833451 ive spent bits of every season the last four years up and down
8833452 was a bit of a surprise but it wasnt something i was going to let bother me i was going to go down there and get my work in and get back up here as quick as i could
8833453 i dont want to put too much pressure on that if you start focusing on that number you might try too hard or overdo it itd be nice
8833454 to be told i might not be able to play again and to make it back to the big leagues
8833455 it was just like last year in a lot of ways but a conference game and playing the way we did you have to give all the credit to the line and the fullbacks for getting on bodies the whole night
8833456 he doesnt talk about his team and i dont talk about our team
8833457 we definitely have to play better well take the win but weve got to get better
8833458 it was great to see we knew we had a better football team than a year ago
8833459 to see it come out with a win tonight really makes us feel good its the kind of thing that will bring us even tighter together
8833460 we put this game on the offensive line we talked at halftime that this was the no 1 rush defense in the country last year and we wanted to out physical them we did that
8833461 i think chief executive peter storrie has made him a short term contract offer
8833462 if you ask me though i do get the feeling it is not going to happen
8833463 he has had a bad knee but if thats all right hes a good player
8833464 i saw him play against chelsea two or three years ago for barcelona and he was fantastic that night in the middle of the park
8833465 kami semua tahu bahwa kematian orang yang kita sayangi akan memiliki dampak luar biasa bagi kehidupan suami atau istri yang ditinggal tapi penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa dampak tersebut ternyata langsung pada tingkat kematian demikian tulis dr jaap spreeuw peneliti
8833466 secara statiskit terbukti bahwa orang dapat meninggal karena sakit hati terutama di bagian2 awal rasa sakit yang ada berita baiknya adalah bahwa penelitian ini menunjukkan juga bahwa setelah tahun pertama kemungkinan untuk meninggal akibat sakit hati ini menurun menunjukkan bahwa orang bisa mandiri dan berdiri sendiri dan menghadapi rasa sakit akibat ditinggal orang yang mereka cintai
8833467 gee how did that happen how did this big business come out of that little thing that we were researching

8833469 perempuan yang mengenakan sepatu tinggi membuat kaki terlihat lebih panjang dan seksi saya paling suka memandangi kaki perempuan
8833470 saya suka perempuan berperut ramping karena itu menandakan dia tidak hamil haha tapi sebenarnya bukan hanya itu ketika melihat perempuan perutnya rata itu berarti dia bisa mengurus diri kalau dia sudah bisa merawat dirinya dengan baik dia pasti bisa mengurus saya kelak
8833471 saya tidak terlalu peduli dia cantik atau tidak asalkan wajahnya terkesan ramah saya pasti interest apalagi jika wajahnya kekanak kanakan lucu dan penuh senyum rasanya saya akan merasa nyaman berada di dekatnya wajah seperti ini membut saya ingin selalu melindungi dia sebaliknya wajah yang jutek membuat saya ingin kabur darinya
8833472 bibir tipis dan kecil menunjukkan dia perempuan banyak bicara saya pernah menjalin hubungan dengan perempuan berbibir tipis memang dia lebih banyak bicara daripada saya haha bibir tipis sebenarnya tak masalah asal disiati dengan penggunaan lipstik merah sehingga mengesankan bibir yang penuh

8833477 we are at the beginning of the end of the sacramento housing crash
8833478 there are more house price declines to come but the worst of the free fall in prices is at hand
8833479 the bottom of the housing market is coming into view
8833480 there remain some serious threats to the outlook including the ongoing credit crunch and weak job market
8833481 but with a bit of luck including stable oil prices and good policymaking the sacramento housing market will find its footing by this time next year and prices will resume rising again early in the next decade
8833482 restore housing affordability and coax first time buyers back into the market
8833483 im 28 and this is the biggest dream ive always wanted to accomplish
8833484 if the market wasnt the way it is i couldnt have made a buy
8833485 honestly i just wanted a house i dont really see it as an investment hopefully ill get married in the house and have children and the dog will have puppies
8833486 but it finally came down to a quality of life issue
8833487 i wanted a home that better suited my needs and i couldnt let the market be an issue any longer i intend to stay where i am for some time
8833488 i think we are plowing through all the good buyers who are enthusiastically in the market
8833489 were going to get to november and be at the end of the buyer pool
8833490 our region is not immune to whats being felt in markets across the country but were kind of holding our own
8833491 were down less than 1 percent despite everything thats going on in the general economy
8833492 were open from mid august to mid may and people always ask me in may when were going to open again i tell them when the temperatures is 105 degrees so ive just missed it by a couple of degrees
8833493 we were flying high in december and then it just stopped snowing at the end of february
8833494 our business was down about 7 percent because of that
8833495 i think many of us are concerned about the price of gas and the economic downturn
8833496 i think about it but i really dont know what to expect weve done ok during tough times before
8833497 an abundance of snow tends to override those other economic factors
8833498 gas prices and the economy are something were definitely paying attention to
8833499 we hope the snow comes early in october and blows all those worries away
8833500 as it is were only about seven or eight weeks away from making snow i know its hard to be thinking about that when its about 100 degrees but the season is just around the corner
8833501 people start thinking about christmas way early so we do the same thing
8833502 these swap and sale events are a great way to stock up early before the weather gets cold and the rush begins
8833503 it is a lifetimes memory for me if i survive i will tell these stories of helplessness and life on the edge to the younger generation
8833504 this is the first time we have come across the sorrow caused by the river it is more dangerous than what folklore makes it out to be in this rural belt
8833505 we have seen floods it is an annual phenomenon here but the kosi river changing its course and shifting riverbeds is a different story altogether
8833506 the way the river changed its course and brought problems and is threatening hundreds of thousands of of people it appears that the god of nature is angry with us
8833507 had the nano car project been in gujarat the company would have met the production schedule but in west bengal right from its inception there has been stiff resistance and politicisation leading to a stage wherein tata has almost given an indication to shift the project elsewhere
8833508 considering the same tata should think of gujarat as project destination gcci will extend all necessary help to ensure the project runs smoothly
8833509 after implementation of narmada project there is ample water and electricity in the state the law and order situation is good for industrial growth with increasing purchasing power of people at large state of gujarat also offers a potentially large domestic market
8833510 moreover there is adequate skilled labour force with well developed engineering sme sector the state has inherent capacity to become a strong ancillary centre
8833511 trotz dieser guten performance ist in unseren augen die bewertung immer noch niedrig wir sehen unver ndert weiteres kurspotenzial auch wegen des soliden akquisitionskurses den das management f hrt
8833512 die verbesserungen die alleine auf organischem wachstum basieren untermauern die guidance
8833513 destinys energy farm will be a proving ground for technologies and practices of the future and is a testament to our commitment to create a truly eco sustainable community in the state
8833514 its just the beginning of building a city that operates with minimal impact on the environment and serves as a scientific hub where the latest green technology innovations will emerge
8833515 we expect an increase in riders this year because of the high price of gas the difficulties in finding campus parking and because more people are concerned about being more environmentally friendly
8833516 man kan ikke sige at en eller anden bestemt frist udl ser en opholdstilladelse det f r man mig ikke til at sige og s dan er det

8833518 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008
8833519 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be
8833520 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8833521 desde entonces el programa cient fico se dedic a investigar el conocimiento a partir de dicha met fora entendiendo la realidad natural y social como si estuviera ordenada en forma de relato narrativo a descifrar planteamiento nudo y desenlace es decir continuidad lineal l gica causal consecutiva regularidad legal crecimiento acumulativo predicci n de futuro y conocimiento ltimo un programa cient fico pero en el fondo literario cuyo paradigma es la teor a darwinista de la evoluci n de las especies que puede generalizarse para explicar las distintas esferas de la realidad social la filosof a de la historia dominada por la idea del progreso el poder pol tico volcado en la busca del control social la sociolog a glosando los procesos de racionalizaci n y modernizaci n las vanguardias art sticas creadoras de dise os cada vez m s innovadores y aut nomos

8833523 el cambio s bito e imprevisto de la realidad hacia formas irreconocibles por monstruosas il gicas deformes o grotescas
8833524 we made it on a lark and it took off immediately
8833525 weve been planning some bigfoot marketing because this year is the 50th anniversary of the legend
8833526 we have an annual bigfoot days celebration over labor day each year in willow creek and we wanted to figure out a way to honor that
8833527 we found out the folks at the blue lake casino near arcata had a bigfoot suit from horrordome com it was the same suit the georgia guys had used and everybody was talking about the lion so the producers thought well why dont we do a parody
8833528 and this was a way to showcase our eye candy
8833529 a local ranger allowed them to exercise the sasquatch now named bigfoot in the redwood park grounds but he quickly became too big for their apartment
8833530 we dont mean to say that travel isnt soft right now certainly people are being more cautious in their trips and looking for ways to economize but its kind of come across that everybodys staying home and thats not true
8833531 through the study we were able to quantify that it is really a small percentage 14 percent who have taken a staycation or are planning a staycation 9 percent
8833532 when he told me where we were going i started crying because i wouldnt even have thought of this myself
8833533 we see a lot of people who dont want to spend the money or the time for travel and are looking around locally and saying what can i do that will transport me without going far away
8833534 we are literally seeing people from six blocks away coming to spend a night or two at the inn
8833535 but what weve found is that most people still want to get away and enjoy themselves whether locally or not
8833536 what theyre doing differently is making adjustments they may be driving shorter distances spending less when they get there downgrading their lodging handling their disposable income differently but they still plan to get away even if its local
8833537 but this year looking at june and july our occupancy is up about 10 percent and we are seeing a lot of couples during the week which before we didnt have usually during the week we see mostly business travelers
8833538 a noticeable increase in leisure travelers most coming from within 50 miles away
8833539 but once that was over reservations picked up by 10 percent which is a big number in the hotel business
8833540 the numbers point to the resilience of the traveler and that theyre hanging in there
8833541 i think people are expecting a challenging holiday season with the whole air situation in general but with the price of gas coming down its looking better
8833542 previous surveys have tracked how consumers adapt to prices and the results have been amazing
8833543 weve asked several times in the past about gas prices going up and how much more theyre willing to pay and each time we ask that threshold gets higher and higher
8833544 the will of the people is that they want to go its just a matter of what they can fit in with their personal finances and what conditions are going to be like
8833545 my take is that i did see less spending over there because of the euro but these people are still motivated to go
8833546 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8833547 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2
8833548 for example while fuel duty recognises the environmental costs of driving it also pays for important public services including new roads and public transport and efforts to tackle child poverty
8833549 learned that global warming is almost certainly caused by humans
8833550 damaging our chances of addressing this serious problem before the consequences do become catastrophic
8833551 the difference between science and religion is the difference between a willingness to dispassionately consider new evidence and new arguments and a passionate unwillingness to do so
8833552 our very health and economic well being are at stake

8833565 pakistan had approached some countries including india to support the board in organising a triangular or quadrangular tournament in south africa to fill in the gap left open in pakistans cricket calender with the postponement of the champions trophy
8833566 now the modalities including venues and dates for the tri series is being worked out but tentatively it should start from september 12
8833567 we are not going to adopt a tit for tat policy because the decision to postpone champions trophy was in the end unanimous people dont realise that pakistan has still got the hosting rights and it was because of strong stand taken by some boards that the tournament was not relocated to sri lanka

8833618 we decided to fully translate both titles which drove up costs
8833619 if you look at the dutch speaking market then its hard to spread the costs across a limited number of consumers
8833620 a french or a german version for instance would be subject to the same costs but the costs would fall due to there being a larger number of users
8833621 my personal experience is that people around here are very conservative with water especially when they have to pay for it
8833622 the ones that do id assume would be the older wells under 50 feet deep that depend on runoff

8833627 we are investigating whether he is operating a business out of a residential property a location not zoned for commercial retail sales
8833628 what it comes down to in this particular case is is it artwork or commercial sales if he wants them to be art as weve currently classified them they cannot be offered for sale

8833643 stand alone journalism almost completely self sufficient and able to reach readers directly without any unnecessary filters
8833644 it was time to escape the daily need to assume a public role to be what society and especially families expected
8833645 for me its ultimately the order of the cosmos or what i describe as the creation
8833646 you cant simply have in my own judgment creation simply being a random event because it is so inherently ordered and the fact that the natural environment is being ordered where it can properly coexist over time
8833647 if you were simply reducing that to mathematical probabilities ive got to say it probably wouldnt have happened
8833648 so i think there is an intelligent mind at work

8833661 our commitment to the design community has always been strong and we look forward to meeting some of our users and making lots of new friends
8833662 hes opened up a lot of markets for agriculture and hes a real supporter of agriculture which might be good in the federal government too
8833663 when he went in to being governor our state was deep in debt and he helped bring it out so i think hed be a great asset
8833664 theres pros and cons but hes been real good as governor so i guess dont want to lose him that way
8833665 i think itd be a great loss to minnesota but i think hed be a great vice president
8833666 i think what we have to offer is so much more than some other gaming destinations in the entire country gamings just not unique anymore but deadwood really is
8833667 i think if you throw a dart on a map within a hundred mile radius theres going to be gaming i think what deadwood has is something different what we have to offer weve got the history weve got the old west weve got the black hills
8833668 if youre not doing good in one place you can go to another place and they dont cater to the high rollers this is for the common man to come here and have a little fun and maybe make a little money
8833669 if we come over here and we have a good time and only spend a hundred dollars we think we won usually we eat have a meal and have a good time and a hundred dollars is pretty cheap entertainment
8833670 when it left here it left in little packages so now its an amazing thing for people to come and look and people have been amazed by it
8833671 everybodys talking about it its something the whole state is talking about weve had people from 48 states and 11 foreign countries come through faith this year and thats amazing for a community the size of 480 people
8833672 really we are right where a lot of tyrannosaurus skeletons have been discovered in the hill creek formation and its very interesting to be right here
8833673 i think theyve done a really good job here and i really like this exhibit and i just think theyve done a great job
8833674 wed seen sue at the natural history museum in chicago and it was a very nice exhibit but you were a lot further away and here it was much more intimate so it was kind of nice to sit and contemplate the skeleton for awhile
8833675 its important to me because in minnesota we dont really have a lot of dinosaur exhibits so coming out here to experience it is really a new thing but just learning what is out and about and even in your backyard is really a cool thing
8833676 for the hotels and the cafes and everything the convenience stores its meant a lot its really helped out this summer
8833677 its inspected and kept in good shape and they do a three year review of our situation
8833678 thats what this process goes through its to make sure this is not dangerous
8833679 we dont want to hurt any kids thats an obvious
8833680 it is kept finished and theres a its not being cut into or damaged its not dangerous according to the report
8833681 we go through the meet the letter of the law and go through this process and we should be safe
8833682 do you always do that say one thing and mean another
8833683 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be and that the military to military relationship were building with pakistan is getting stronger every day
8833684 there is a growing complexity and coordination among extremist groups there an almost syndicate like behaviour that has resulted in new and ever more sophisticated attacks on coalition forces
8833685 to try to do that through the eyes of the leadership who live and work and fight there every single day
8833686 thats a continuous ongoing discussion no big breakthroughs there still committed to where we can and where they ask us committed to help them and train them where they ask for the kind of assistance that they think they need

8833712 we need doctors with expertise and an understanding of the field of work

8833750 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
8833751 i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her
8833752 there was another story claiming i was a neat freak if i had to choose one of the two i think id rather be a sex addict its not funny and ill be glad when it goes away

8833761 they want to play super nintendo and watch sports and hit on hot chicks but if you get them involved then they vote correctly
8833762 i was born within 50 yards of the main london north east railway as a kid i used to go trainspotting
8833763 a few years ago i went to a railway exhibition and saw the model trains running around and i thought that would look nice in my garden
8833764 i started building the railway three years ago and i make everything myself i started with one track now i have four i make all the houses and stations from plywood and the tiles on the top are made from cedar wood all the tiles are stuck on individually so everything is more or less weather proof i use anything i can find around the house like floor tiles i never throw anything away
8833765 the wife liked the lawn and wasnt happy when i started digging it up but shes very happy with it now
8833766 i loved my garden my lawn and my flower beds
8833767 but it has been nice the coaches pulling up and we are now doing a bit of charity work for macmillan nurses so i am quite enjoying it
8833768 we have like the government made considerable efforts to reduce infection including replacing all beds opening a dedicated infection control ward with clean air facilities introducing a bed washer system and specialist staff teams to continue to place infection control at the very top of our healthcare agenda
8833769 the vast majority of these deaths could have been avoided if the government had only taken the right action at the right time
8833770 a key element of this is ensuring we have accurate information on infections and their consequences including more complete reporting on death certificates
8833771 work to reduce infections includes expanding screening programmes implementing robust hygiene guidelines ensuring appropriate antibiotic prescribing improving equipment and the hospital environment and employing extra matrons who play a key role in reducing infections
8833772 training sessions are also being provided for residential and care home staff to emphasise the role they can play in reducing infections
8833773 we will not rest until there are no avoidable cases of c diff
8833774 we are helping michael as he deals with some personal issues and he has the full support of everyone at the club
8833775 we would ask that his privacy and that of his family is respected at this time and the club will not be commenting further on this matter
8833776 at 2 34am on monday august 25 police were called to a report of a man outside and also ringing the doorbell at grove park crescent gosforth
8833777 we are all looking forward to tomorrow and we are right behind anyone who wants to celebrate the club
8833778 to think that we were the first to win the world cup is amazing
8833779 it was very very hard we aimed to do it in 14 days but we were doing really well and got it down to 11 days
8833780 none of us ride bikes at all it was a very interesting venture it was fun really spot on
8833781 we are extremely pleased with the progress being made at skylink international business park
8833782 there is clear support for improving public transport as a way to access services
8833783 this research helps to reassure us that there is a demand for a passenger train service to northallerton and will add strength to the case for investment in its re opening
8833784 we will need funding for further such studies as we examine every aspect of the case for extending the wensleydale railway
8833785 fontenot hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8833786 certainly now with gas prices on the increase that adds to it thats an extra tank of gas a week which depending on what kind of car you drive that can be an extra 50
8833787 people are definitely looking at online courses because of the gas prices
8833788 but they are also looking at them because it offers scheduling flexibility
8833789 you have the convenience of not having to go anywhere and sometimes you can get weeks ahead and knock a course out early
8833790 i enjoy the fact that i could teach at my convenience just like they could learn at theirs
8833791 and if i wanted to take a business trip i could still teach them
8833792 diese begegnung hat zwar keinen sch nheitspreis verdient aber die tatsache dass wir uns am ende deutlich durchgesetzt haben spricht f r die gute moral und den siegeswillen in unserer mannschaft
8833793 we ran the club and we were downstairs drinking after the gig when one of the roadies came in and said one of his hendrix guitars was missing
8833794 hendrix didnt seem that bothered he was concerned about his white guitar which was the best one
8833795 but it was his black one that had gone and this was the one that was more or less used for show to bang around the mic stand and the amps
8833796 the guy who i had got it off admitted he had got it off someone who had acquired it from hendrix
8833797 i only had it a couple of months and then sold it onto another guy it ended up with someone living in shildon or bishop auckland i think
8833798 it was horrible it had been used and abused and was not in a pristine condition
8833799 it could well have been the guitar that hendrix knocked about
8833800 it did not even sound good it was a dog as guitars go
8833801 we had a little tete a tete after the gig a little jam but he was 10 000 miles ahead of the rest of us in the way he played the guitar
8833802 i remember he was in awe of eric clapton and was very lucid he was not drugged up at that particular time
8833803 i wish i still bloody had it but in those days there was not the significance about it that there is now
8833804 with hendrix being such a superstar it might fetch about 250 000 now

8833993 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me
8833994 lord i am not naturally organized and you of all people know my lazy sidetracked ways i need your strength to teach my children
8833995 we do not intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves everyone is subjected to the law even websites and blogs
8833996 this is merely the first step in a comprehensive and reprehensible attempt to curb the access of conscientious malaysians to the internet

8834001 this landmark agreement sets a new industrywide precedent that will force companies to disclose the true financial risks that climate change poses to their investors coal fired power plants can significantly contribute to global warming and investors have the right to know all the associated risks
8834002 screw you havelock peeps i live in the gvegas now peace out
8834003 what information did i have to assemble and understand in order to enact this perspective without falling into a pattern of destructive impulses
8834004 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8834005 we believe confess and teach that the only rule and norm according to which all dogmas and doctrines ought to be esteemed and judged is no other whatever than the prophetic and apostolic writings both of the old and of the new testaments
8834006 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction for training in righteousness
8834007 but know this first of all that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of ones own interpretation for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will but men moved by the holy spirit spoke from god
8834008 you shall not add to the word which i am commanding you nor take away from it that you may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you
8834009 i testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds to them god shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city which are written in this book
8834010 there are three persons in the godhead the father the son and the holy ghost and these three are one god the same in substance equal in power and glory
8834011 hear o israel the lord is our god the lord is one
8834012 thus says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and there is no god besides me
8834013 god said behold the man has become like one of us
8834014 also calling god his own father making himself equal with god
8834015 ananias why has satan filled your heart to lie to the holy spirit you have not lied to men but to god
8834016 the doctrine of the trinity is not irrational what is irrational is to suppress the biblical evidence for trinity in favor of unity or the evidence for unity in favor of trinity
8834017 our data must take precedence over our models or stating it better our models must sensitively reflect the full range of data
8834018 a close analogy to the theologians procedure here lies in the work of the theoretical physicist subatomic light entities are found on examination to possess wave properties w particle properties p and quantum properties h
8834019 though these characteristics are in many respects incompatible particles dont diffract while waves do etc physicists explain or model an electron as pwh they have to do this in order to give proper weight to all the relevant data
8834020 likewise the theologian who speaks of god as three in one
8834021 the choice is clear either the trinity or a god who is only a pale imitation of the lord of biblical and confessional christianity
8834022 jesus kept increasing in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man
8834023 and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights he then became hungry
8834024 and behold there arose a great storm in the sea so that the boat was covered with the waves but he himself was asleep
8834025 but coming to jesus when they saw he was already dead they did not break his legs
8834026 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
8834027 jesus said to him he who has seen me has seen the father
8834028 for this cause therefore the jews were seeking all the more to kill him because he not only was breaking the sabbath but also was calling god his own father making himself equal with god
8834029 looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great god and saviour christ jesus
8834030 from now on i am telling you before it comes to pass so that when it does occur you may believe that i am he
8834031 and jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic my son your sins are forgiven
8834032 and on that day when evening had come he said to them let us go over to the other side and leaving the multitude they took him along with them just as he was in the boat and other boats were with him
8834033 jesus saw nathanael coming to him and said of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile
8834034 and it came about soon afterwards that he went to a city called nain and his disciples were going along with him accompanied by a large multitude
8834035 this is a marvelous claim this explains why in the previous verse
8834036 he shall glorify me for he shall take of mine and shall declare it unto you
8834037 and we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding in order that we might know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life
8834038 now we know that you know all things and have no need for anyone to question you by this we believe that you came from god
8834039 but there are some of you who do not believe for jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe and who it was that would betray him
8834040 but jesus aware of their reasonings answered and said to them
8834041 i am the alpha and the omega says the lord god
8834042 teaching them to observe all that i commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the age
8834043 and the angel answered and said to her the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you and for that reason the holy offspring shall be called the son of god luke 1 35 nasv
8834044 jesus said to him i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father but through me
8834045 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
8834046 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another even as i have loved you that you also love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
8834047 much more then having now been justified by his blood we shall be saved from the wrath of god through him
8834048 for if by the transgression of the one death reigned through the one much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one jesus christ
8834049 so then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men
8834050 for as through the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners even so through the obedience of the one the many will be made righteous
8834051 and the law came in that the transgression might increase but where sin increased grace abounded all the more that as sin reigned in death even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
8834052 my little children i am writing these things to you that you may not sin and if anyone sins we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
8834053 in the future there is laid up for me the crown i of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing
8834054 i tell the truth but that doesnt make me god
8834055 you shall fear only the lord your god and you shall worship him and swear by his name
8834056 then jesus said to him begone satan for it is written you shall worship the lord your god and serve him only
8834057 where is he who has been born king of the jews for we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him and they came into the house and saw the child with mary his mother and they fell down and worshipped him matthew 2 2 11 nasb
8834058 and behold jesus met them and greeted them and they came up and took hold of his feet and worshipped him
8834059 and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him
8834060 let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in the worship of the angels
8834061 exchanged the glory of the incorruptible god for an image in the form of corruptible man
8834062 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not as a result of works that no one should boast
8834063 he saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the holy spirit
8834064 but as many as received him to them he gave the right to become children of god even to those who believe in his name
8834065 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace
8834066 therefore if any man is in christ he is a new creature the old things are passed away behold new things have come
8834067 god created man male and female after his own im age in knowledge righteousness and holiness with dominion over the creatures
8834068 and god said let us make man in our image
8834069 the untaught and unstable distort as they do also the rest of the scriptures to their own destruction
8834070 they have been told to be ready to cut off supplies as soon as monday
8834071 ya allah berkahilah kami di bulan rajab dan syaban dan sampaikanlah usia kami ke bulan ramadhan
8834072 telah datang kepadamu bulan ramadhan penghulu segala bulan maka sambutlah dengan selamat dating kepadanya telah dating bulan puasa membawa segala rupa keberkahan maka alangkah mulianya tamu yang agung itu
8834073 sesungguhnya hanya disisi allah ilmu tentang hari kiamat dan dia yang menurunkan hujan dan mengetahui apa yang ada dalam rahim dan tidak ada seorang pun yang dapat mengetahui dengan pasti apa yang akan dikerjakannya besok dan tidak ada seorang pun yang dapat mengetahui di bumi mana dia akan mati sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal
8834074 we put the screws down one side to hold it down so it wont blow away but the council were claiming it was a permanent structure and said we had to take it down
8834075 it just seems whatever we do we have somebody complaining about something
8834076 there has been a drop in trade but this is managing to keep us going they havent given us a reduction in council rates because of the smoking ban so i dont see why i need this
8834077 there was the temptation to go vic mackey if they didnt solve this real soon
8834078 but instead i spent a lot of time talking to people who are a lot smarter than me about what do we do now
8834079 i learned about the companies that run this business and politics leverage and power it was interesting to see how a group of lawyers treated the likes of carlton cuse lost and marc cherry desperate housewives and neal baer law amp order svu and carol mendelsohn csi crime scene investigation and people who have created properties that have made those companies so much money i didnt think it was right
8834080 grew up with midwest values and always knew his parents loved him
8834081 as a writer your job is to explore the moral issues that interest you the most
8834082 you cant be principled without really thinking about whats right and wrong and i think clearly shawn has done that shawn was always fascinated with the moral ambiguities of characters and i think the psychopathology of vic mackey makes him one of the greatest characters thats been written for television
8834083 nash bridges writers rode with police officers in san francisco
8834084 he put his conviction into his words and that led to a whole new chapter in his life one which really established his position as being one of those voices out here in the tv landscape that defined show runners as artists
8834085 the shield which premiered in march 2002 with 5 million viewers a cable series record at the time in its first year it won the golden globe for best series and earned chiklis an emmy for his pit bull portrayal of mackey the shield not only put fx on the map
8834086 a lot of tv was getting very stagnant so there was an appetite for this kind of stuff he says
8834087 i was just trying to do my little show and we got really lucky with the timing those gates were ready to open whether it was us or somebody else
8834088 i like songs that have a strong ending and books that have the confidence to end and say this or that
8834089 if those franchisees were surprised with the negative results that they achieved then you likely will be too
8834090 you should not have any money exchange before you have time to fully review the offer
8834091 the vast majority of muslims believe in a future of peace tolerance

8834119 erra disahkan mengandung bulan lalu dan kini kandungannya sudah pun berusia tiga bulan kami sangat gembira dengan berita ini dan berharap supaya peminat dapat mendoakan kesihatan isteri saya
8834120 erra kini sedang sibuk di lokasi drama jadi saya banyak menasihatkan dia supaya berhati hati menjaga kandungan dan jangan mengangkat barang berat
8834121 sebagai suami tentulah saya gembira kerana ini pengalaman pertama saya bakal bergelar bapa
8834122 saya terlalu gembira dengan berita kehamilan erra kandungan yang berusia hampir tiga bulan ini seperti melengkapkan hasrat kami berdua kerana itu seboleh bolehnya saya tidak mahu berjauhan daripada isteri saya
8834123 saya perlu menghubungi dia dari semasa ke semasa untuk mengingatkan dia agar jangan lupa makan dan mengambil makanan tambahan untuk memberikan tenaga padanya
8834124 saya sentiasa berdoa kepada allah agar kandungan sulung isteri saya terpelihara dengan baik kerana kami berdua sudah lama teringin untuk menimang cahaya mata sulung
8834125 kini pantang ada masa lapang saya akan pastikan berada di sisi erra kerana saya mahu memberikan sokongan moral padanya
8834126 kami buat pemeriksaan minggu lepas dan syukur kerana akhirnya impian kami untuk memiliki cahaya mata bakal menjadi kenyataan
8834127 saya izinkan erra aktif dalam aktiviti seninya selagi ia tidak menjejaskan kandungannya
8834128 ya memang betul erra mengandung dah dua bulan apabila saya mengetahui berita erra mengandung dua bulan lalu kami ingat tak nak hebahkan kepada umum dan kecoh kecoh biar keluarga sahaja yang tahu takut heboh awal awal nanti tak jadi pula
8834129 tetapi dua minggu lepas doktor dah sahkan yang kandungannya sihat dan dia bagi ubat untuk jaga kandungan erra
8834130 nampaknya kali ini saya terpaksa beritahu juga sebab wartawan dah tahu dan tak nak sembunyikan hal ini
8834131 dia masih aktif lagi dalam aktiviti seni lagipun dia sudah tandatangan kontrak dengan astro sekarang dia sedang jalani pengambaran sebuah telefilem untuk astro dengan membawa watak seorang mekanik
8834132 saya risau dan takut juga kerana watak sebegitu agak agresif tetapi saya dah berpesan kepadanya supaya lebih berhati hati saya kena ingatkan dia banyak kali sebab dia selalu terlupa
8834133 jadi diharapkan peminat erra dapat mendoakan kandungannya selamat dan sihat selalu sehingga dilahirkan pada tahun depan insya allah
8834134 bulan puasa kami lebih bermakna pada tahun ini kerana berpuasa sebagai pasangan suami isteri dan bertiga bersama kandungan erra
8834135 erra pun dah sibuk sibuk siapkan apa yang patut untuk raya nanti termasuk memikirkan warna pakaian raya kami insya allah pada hari raya nanti kami akan beraya di kampung saya di pulau pinang dan kampung erra di sungai choh rawang selangor
8834136 setelah melakukan ujian kehamilan sendiri kami berjumpa doktor untuk membuat pengesahan apabila sah erra hamil doktor menasihatkan kami supaya menjaga kandungan ini dengan baik dan tidak boleh terlalu gembira kerana ia masih dalam peringkat awal jadi hanya keluarga terdekat sahaja yang mengetahuinya
8834137 ini mungkin kerana usia kandungannya yang masih terlalu muda tapi pada usia beginilah kandungan perlu dijaga dengan baik kerana itu saya sentiasa berpesan padanya supaya tidak lagi bersukan atau terlalu aktif serta merta saya juga banned dia daripada naik motor beg dia pun saya yang angkatkan sekarang
8834138 oleh sebab itu saya meminta erra merahsiakan jantina anak setelah dia mengetahuinya kelak mungkin ketika dia mahu melakukan imbasan untuk mengetahui jantina nanti saya akan duduk di luar dahulu
8834139 eloklah kalau bayi kami nanti lahir pada bulan mac tak seperti ibu bapanya yang lahir pada bulan februari dan agak agresif kebanyakan bayi bulan mac saya lihat baik baik belaka semoga nanti dia akan menjadi sebaik ibu saya
8834140 kata doktor berat erra yang naik empat kilo sejak mengandung agak mendadak memandangkan usia kandungan baru sembilan minggu mana tidaknya pagi pagi lagi erra sudah rasa hendak makan nampaknya kenalah erra jaga pemakanan sedikit selepas ini
8834141 risau juga kerana kata doktor alahan kadangkala hanya akan dialami setelah kandungan berusia lebih tiga bulan harap harap tidaklah terlalu teruk alahan itu nanti tentang jadual kerja erra sudah pun membuat jadual yang sesuai sebaik sahaja mendapat tahu diri sudah hamil selagi mampu erra akan menyudahkan penggambaran drama yang membabitkan erra

8834147 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8834148 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8834149 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8834150 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8834151 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8834152 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8834153 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8834154 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on behalf of them that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8834155 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8834156 next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8834157 and we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8834158 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500
8834159 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8834160 le s nateur de la moselle jean louis masson a de nouveau interrog le gouvernement sur les moyens de prot ger les nom des communes face leur
8834161 what does joe biden say about barack obama find out today
8834162 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8834163 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8834164 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8834165 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8834166 thank you for trying out our mash beta service we hope you had fun with it please note that we will shut down mash on september 29 2008 as a result your current profile on mash will no longer be available
8834167 is an imperfect man but was seeking to redeem himself
8834168 i thought it was very na ve on both their parts it would be very sad if he were the nominee of our party right now
8834169 think of the people they betrayed yes they these women these political spouses have to stop enabling their husband to behave like this because as long as they do the men will continue to cheat lie and betray this kind of thing hurts everybody most important it hurts women it paints all of us as pathetic victims or potential ones in any case
8834170 the management and the administration at the hospital had been informed numerous times since 2005
8834171 they were warned there was a risk that the number of cases of c difficile would increase
8834172 she would tense up in pain while she was in a coma
8834173 in the past i had my sister with me and in the present im all alone
8834174 that is great in itself but i was hoping for at least one fly fisher in a funny hat
8834175 they said we really need to reach out to latino voters especially in the west but in florida also
8834176 were not a news operation but our mission is to celebrate african american culture and chronicle african american achievement
8834177 its not expressly regulated and the city does not support or sponsor it
8834178 can reach your home with a minimum amount of delay
8834179 any number of things could prevent us from seeing the numbers such as a parked car or snow
8834180 it would be better to upkeep the numbers on your home itself
8834181 it doesnt hurt to have the curb numbers but its not what we would recommend
8834182 thats the criticism this service gets but its no different than having your grass cut or your gutters cleaned
8834183 advertising has to have a shock value or else it gets pitched into the trash
8834184 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8834185 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8834186 i asked the gsa about the closing and was told that only higher bids made between 9am and 3 pm could extend the deadline which is why the sales were concluded that did not make sense to me because the invitation to bid says timely bids received before 3 pm would extend the auction even though 4 bids were made within the 24 hours before the 3 pm august 27 deadline none counted to extend the sale because they were not made within a specific 6 hour period 9 am to 3 pm that is not even stated in the invitation for bids
8834187 i believe the auction should have been continued for another day and that the termination was improper under the stated rules for the sale no where in the invitation of bid does it state that only bids from 9 am to 3 pm only will extend the sale and that earlier bids made between 3 pm of the date before and 9 am of the final day will not do so a day is 24 hours not 6 hours i have asked that the issue be reviewed by the gsas legal department if not reversed i may file a lawsuit to reopen the sale
8834188 he has asked us to do a legal review of our online auction process for these two new york lights which we will do we will respond to him in writing on tuesday
8834189 the auction closes at 3 00 pm eastern when there are no bids during the business day the invitation for bids for both west bank and old orchard lights states this as does the website the only way the auction could have been kept open is if someone had made a bid before 3 00 pm
8834190 the fact that there were no bids for either is why the auctions closed
8834191 actually it all comes down to an error in the computer program because i was told that it was set to only recognize bids after 9 am to do the extension had it been properly set to recognize any bid after 3 p m then the extension would have taken place automatically basically the gsa staff is in the position of defending a computer error which i do not think would work before a judge and i do not think an attorney for the gsa would want to argue a losing point
8834192 it actually is in the best interests of the gsa to continue the sale because they will get at least 15 000 more for each lighthouse and probably much more because there were two more bidders besides me on west bank who were cut off from making higher bids
8834193 represents a superior program for the preservation and public use of the
8834194 when youre my age and you work at a place for a while you just get a feeling
8834195 they really did seem to be getting their act together in terms of operations
8834196 if only they couldve ridden out this bad period of the economy
8834197 were trying to position ourselves not only as a leading provider of tattoo friendly artwork but a consumer advocate in their process guiding them along the way
8834198 traditional sales of printed tattoo flash have gone way down and the single design sales to end consumers and to shops have gone way up
8834199 people that were selling tens of thousands of dollars worth of flash every month arent doing that anymore
8834200 thats how weve always grown through looking at each others art
8834201 now that we can communicate globally the progression of the art has grown
8834202 this is a classic partnership where were leveraging mutual assets
8834203 weve participated in presidential elections in the past so this is not new
8834204 we view this as fulfilling our role as a good public citizen
8834205 creating goodwill with legislators is a good business plan for companies
8834206 were willing to take less for shipping because we think youll buy five more items from us as opposed to if we got as much as we could from you shipping this product you may never buy again

8834235 it pleases me to announce the establishment of the economic and business interface group ebig which will serve as the platform from which views from the malaysian indian business and commercial community can be channeled directly to the cabinet committee on indian welfare
8834236 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of central elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8834237 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
8834238 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8834239 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8834240 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8834241 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8834242 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 per cent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8834243 what is that american promise its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
8834244 its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create american jobs look out for american workers and play by the rules of the road
8834245 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8834246 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8834247 just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad
8834248 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8834249 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8834250 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8834251 and today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from iraq has been echoed by the iraqi government and even the bush administration even after we learned that iraq has a 79 billion dollar surplus while were wallowing in deficits john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8834252 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8834253 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
8834254 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but that is not the change that america needs
8834255 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8834256 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8834257 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8834258 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
8834259 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8834260 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
8834261 and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8834262 in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating these policies with john mccain
8834263 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and each others patriotism
8834264 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8834265 part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose
8834266 this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8834267 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8834268 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8834269 you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington
8834270 conventional coffee cups are made from ceramic compositions which do not absorb microwaves and hence they do not heat up when conventional ceramics are used for heating food only food heats up and then the hot food heats up the ceramic
8834271 the microwaves heat up the container and hence the food rice cooks in about half or less time
8834272 these ceramic materials not only heat up with microwaves but also retain heat for about 15 minutes and hence the food stays hot in the container ceramic plates could be used for pizza delivery as these plates are insulating materials

8834274 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8834275 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8834276 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8834277 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8834278 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8834279 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8834280 you want affidavits from two million other men to say that they did not sleep with her
8834281 there was no question of targeting any socioeconomic group selectively
8834282 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on savage rumbaugh s 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8834283 she was using language to get at what she wanted she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanisha s knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8834284 the importance of janni s ph d can t be overstated
8834285 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8834286 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further

8834288 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8834289 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8834290 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia

8834316 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8834317 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans

8834352 obviously you saw some other product probably silicon sealant grout is concrete
8834353 i saw a quote from one of your readers that points out a common misconception the reader spoke of hot humid days when heavier denser air is drawn down the chimney contrary to popular belief humid air is not heavier than dry air the opposite is true it actually weighs less we have this situation at times as well though more often in the fall and winter when we get large high pressure systems moving through our midwest location i imagine the candle situation to reverse the flow could work though the cause is not heavy humid air
8834354 unfortunately burning candles simply masks the symptoms and doesnt address the real issue with a stinky fireplace
8834355 there are commercial chimney deodorants that work pretty well and many people have good results with baking soda or even kitty litter set in the fireplace the real problem is the air being drawn down the chimney a symptom of overall pressure problems in the house some make up air should be introduced somewhere else in the house a tight sealing top mounted damper will also reduce this air flow coming down the chimney

8834358 this is something very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8834359 i never saw her play before so i didnt know what to expect
8834360 if arsene said he needed 30 million for a striker he would get it no problem at all
8834361 it is not our decision who he spends money on and nor will it ever be we totally back arsene but there is a dual problem for him
8834362 if we were to buy the sort of big names that people talk about we would be looking at relatively mature players who then need to be integrated into the way we play
8834363 secondly it impacts on the youngsters and in many cases arsene thinks it is quicker for us to bring a player through our system but that does not mean all we are interested in is the artistic achievement award
8834364 we are not settling for second best we want to win trophies and i think it is time we did but arsene also believes in creating teams with a certain style
8834365 there were great hopes that we would buy heavily this summer but i would refute that we have not bought well nasri has two goals in two games at the emirates stadium and if ars ne could find the right player he would buy again but he hasnt
8834366 i hear all the time that we have no money but i just wish someone would take the time to look at our accounts this is a proper business which produces its own cash and lives or dies by its performances
8834367 our net payments are 20 million and the revenue increase from the new stadium is close to 50 million explain to me how that stadium is a drain on the club when it produces an extra 30 million a year
8834368 this constant suggestion that the stadium is bleeding us dry is crap the reality is our wage bill is very similar to manchester united substantially above liverpool and substantially below chelsea but that is to be expected

8834371 well id like to thank you all for the experience
8834372 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well
8834373 anyone could play against andorra but croatia is different you need players who are 100
8834374 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now
8834375 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8834376 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch

8834394 at a lot of our games wed have the team a few moms and dads and a handful of students
8834395 about the only time it was easy for our fans to see us was when we played at st davids in raleigh
8834396 the congregation at the church all the students and staff at the school and the day care parents all know about the game
8834397 having a home game is an encouragement to our players
8834398 i think we are going to have more school pride and that the school is going to come together more
8834399 it was difficult for us but weve got through so it has been a positive day all round
8834400 we kept on knocking on the door they were in the box seat and could afford to get people behind the ball and play the counter attack
8834401 we always had to be mindful of that but in the end we got our rewards
8834402 youre always relieved there are no easy games its a cliche but in europe there arent
8834403 im delighted we showed a lot of character and i saw qualities and values in the team that i really liked tonight
8834404 i think it sends a message and a statement of what we are about
8834405 i think people now understand that actually man city is a place that is an interesting thought for many people at the moment
8834406 viso che ha votato a favore di bush in pi del 90 per cento dei casi
8834407 i was hoping we would pick up the tempo of the game and sustain it for longer than we did but after scoring four goals in iceland and making a few changes we got through and that is what counts
8834408 we have won okay in the end and to have 25 000 turning out especially with the game live on television i thought was fantastic
8834409 we are in the hat now which is great it is still another two legged affair but it would be great to then get through to the group stages
8834410 it would be great if we can sustain the progress in the premier league that is naturally so important but why not have a crack in europe

8834414 as everyone knows it has been a long drawn out few weeks between the clubs agreeing the fee and what have you but obviously im delighted to be here and to finally get it sorted
8834415 blackburn being a massive club and a premier league club was a chance that i couldnt really let go
8834416 i did everything in my power to get here i was pleading with the chairman at mk dons to get the deal done
8834417 coming here is a fantastic opportunity for me and it is one that i am really relishing and i hope to take with both hands
8834418 im under no illusions it is going to be a very hard test for me to get into the team but it is one that i am relishing and very much looking forward to

8834440 a high school counselor told me about it i always liked science and math and it seemed like a great opportunity
8834441 its more competitive today to get into your college of choice than ever before
8834442 unfortunately its just something thats become necessary if you want to get ahead
8834443 to get accepted into some schools the competition is so steep and they have to decide if thats worth the price
8834444 i think some of the creativity gets kind of drilled out of them
8834445 its a lot of hours its intense we have homework
8834446 my parents are kind of making me but i know it will be totally worthwhile when i take the sat
8834447 the jump is because high school students are starting earlier to work on their college degree
8834448 theyre very ambitious they seem to have a much clearer vision of what they are going to do with their lives than my peers did when i was in high school they know where they want to go they know where they want to be and they know what theyre going to do to reach those goals its really impressive

8834458 the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8834459 he loves his country every bit as much as we do as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
8834460 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
8834461 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
8834462 people tell me that barack obama is making them feel hopeful the way they did when my father was president

8834493 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8834494 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8834495 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8834496 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8834497 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8834498 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8834499 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8834500 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8834501 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8834502 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8834503 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8834504 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8834505 the huizhou project will further increase the energy supply in the pearl river delta in guangdong one of chinas economic powerhouses
8834506 weve been analysing their financial statements and business environment to find out whether there will be any synergy
8834507 the value of a possible deal will not be greater than two billion dollars
8834508 the message that has come from the russians is one that is tied to invading another country invading sovereign territory
8834509 has a lot of us concerned about what it means now what it means a year from now what it means long term with our relationship on the military military side as well as the relationship between our two countries
8834510 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach

8834528 we wont put ourselves under pressure weve played them before and despite losing the game i think we played very well
8834529 we have always played to win in every game that weve been involved in and its no different for this one
8834530 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it

8834577 obama invita a su pa s a un sue o
8834578 estaba en la pomada y acept un golpe de tim n m s parecido a la dictablanda de primo de rivera que a lo de tejero
8834579 buscaba recordar al gobierno que se encuentra en minor a y poner en evidencia la divisi n de los socialistas en este asunto
8834580 se limit a transmitir la foto fija de posiciones ya conocidas
8834581 no pod a esperarse otra cosa por parte del vicepresidente revisar la posici n del gobierno hubiera sido tanto como reconocer una derrota sobre el fondo de la cuesti n en debate
8834582 dej claro que lo que se discute no es tanto la bilateralidad o multilateralidad para alcanzar el acuerdo como el significado de la bilateralidad
8834583 aunque el debate no sirvi para avanzar en el acuerdo s contribuy a relativizar algunos argumentos
8834584 tiene un serio problema para conciliar los intereses de las comunidades aut nomas que son divergentes
8834585 no es imposible llegar a un acuerdo que satisfaga a todas las comunidades pero supondr a indudablemente un fuerte aumento de los recursos que el estado no est en condiciones de afrontar en estos momentos
8834586 fue el propio solbes quien compar el problema de la financiaci n auton mica con un sudoku el tiempo le ha dado la raz n probablemente a su pesar
8834587 tiene ante s una dura prueba que le enfrenta a partidos cuyos votos necesita en el congreso como ciu y erc que ayer dejaron claro que su apoyo no le va a salir gratis a zapatero
8834588 se fue dibujando una realidad implacable el gobierno tiene su propio modelo de c mo han de financiarse los servicios que prestan las comunidades aut nomas lo ha cuantificado y har las provisiones necesarias en los presupuestos del estado
8834589 que solbes acudi al debate mejor preparado que cuantos le interpelaban qued demostrado con la profusi n de datos que aport
8834590 pero fue excesiva por arrogante la pretensi n del vicepresidente de ignorar la vigencia del estatut frente a las dem s leyes estatales que regulan la financiaci n
8834591 una vez m s el enorme desencuentro entre el gabinete socialista y las fuerzas pol ticas de catalunya que fueron contundentes al juzgar en t rminos negativos la actitud gubernamental
8834592 la falta de apoyos estables de zapatero en este mandato de superpone al proceso con los cual toda la discusi n acaba rebotando sobre los presupuestos generales del estado
8834593 no promete giros favorables ni posiciones distintas al borrador ya conocido y duramente criticado por el conseller castells
8834594 todos deber n hacer un esfuerzo para acercar posiciones y despertar confianza
8834595 cumplir zapatero los compromisos que pact con los nacionalistas en el estatut
8834596 se deduce que el gobierno est dispuesto a soplar y sorber al mismo tiempo es decir a satisfacer a todo el mundo
8834597 no parece muy razonable que con un retroceso tan acusado de las recaudaciones el gasto p blico no s lo no se reduzca sino que se dispare
8834598 ser a reprobable que el gobierno obligado por la aritm tica parlamentaria y por la crisis econ mica optase por transferir al mbito de la negociaci n presupuestaria los esfuerzos que debe realizar para alcanzar un acuerdo ptimo y duradero en el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera y en especial para conseguir que la generalitat adopte una postura m s razonable capaz de comprometer tambi n a ciu
8834599 es un argumento fingido que deja en el aire el interrogante de por qu precisamente el psoe ha alentado durante semanas el debate sobre un previsible adelanto electoral que no se va a producir
8834600 no era descabellado pensar que por oportunismo partidista a ferraz le conven a un oto o electoral para distraer la atenci n de la crisis econ mica el cruento debate sobre la financiaci n y el desaf o soberanista en el pa s vasco
8834601 es probable que la crisis econ mica a n transite por una fase dif cil y que el desgaste del psoe sea a n mayor
8834602 ha decidido correr el riesgo de resistir hasta el final en una comunidad en la que un solo diputado m s permitir a al pp retornar a la xunta con mayor a absoluta
8834603 poderosas razones tendr el presidente de la xunta para rechazar finalmente el consejo de ferraz entre esas razones que el pp no est tan d bil como propalan y que el electorado interpretar a el adelanto como una se al de miedo y en tiempos dif ciles nadie vota por los miedosos
8834604 a nadie se le escapa que han sido las presiones del bng las que han dado al traste con un adelanto que touri o ten a m s que decidido
8834605 sale perjudicado con esta demostraci n de debilidad pol tica en un episodio provocado por l mismo
8834606 el goteo diario de datos econ micos se est convirtiendo en un preocupante parte de guerra que ayer oblig al gobierno a anotarse otra p sima noticia
8834607 es preocupante la vertiginosa velocidad con que las cuentas del estado se merman
8834608 pero cosa distinta es que prohibiera a las televisiones difundir a priori im genes que les pudieran llegar ejerciendo en nombre de una concepci n expansiva del secreto de sumario una especie de censura previa

8834618 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8834619 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8834620 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8834621 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten per cent chance on change
8834622 banyak sekali orang yang berpuasa hanya mendapatkan lapar dan dahaga
8834623 orang yang paling merugi adalah ketika allah mendatangkan ramadhan baginya dan dia melewati ramadhan tanpa mengambil apapun darinya
8834624 maka datanglah sesudah mereka pengganti yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan memperturutkan hawa nafsunya maka kelak mereka akan menemui kesesatan kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat dan beramal shalih
8834625 sesungguhnya mereka adalah orang orang yang bersegera dalam mengerjakan perbuatan perbuatan baik dan mereka berdoa kepada kami dengan harap dan cemas dan mereka adalah orang orang yang khusyu kepada kami
8834626 dan hamba ku masih mendekatkan diri kepada ku dengan ibadah ibadah sunnah sampai aku mencintainya
8834627 barangsiapa tidak meninggalkan perkataan dusta perbuatan az zur maka allah tidak membutuhkan perbuatan orang yang tidak bersopan santun maka tiada hajat bagi allah padahal dia meninggalkan makan dan minumnya
8834628 puasa ini bukanlah hanya menahan diri dari makan dan minum saja akan tetapi juga dari dusta dari perbuatan yang salah dan tutur kata yang sia sia
8834629 bicara dulu baru berpikir bukan sebaliknya berpikir dulu disaring baru diucapkan
8834630 barangsiapa menyambung tali persaudaraan silaturrahim di bulan ini allah akan menghubungkan dia dengan rahmat nya
8834631 maka apakah kamu mengira sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kamu secara main main saja dan kamu tidak akan dikembalikan kepada kami maka maha tinggi allah raja yang sebenarnya tidak tuhan yang berhak disembah selain dia tuhan yang mempunyai arsy yang mulia 112 116
8834632 sesungguhnya telah datang bulan ramadhan yang penuh berkah allah telah memfardhukan atas kamu berpuasa di dalamnya dibuka semua pintu surga dikunci semua pintu neraka dan dibelenggu segala syetan di dalamnya ada suatu malam yang lebih baik dari seribu bulan barangsiapa tiada diberikan kebajikan malam itu maka sungguh tidak diberikan kebajikan atasnya
8834633 sesungguhnya allah mencintai orang orang yang berperang di jalan nya dalam saatu barisan yang teratur seakan akan mereka seperti bangunan yang tersusun kokoh
8834634 wahai orang orang beriman bertaqwalah kepada allah dan hendaklah setiap diri memperhatikan apa yang telah diperbuatnya untuk hari esok dan bertaqwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan

8834636 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8834637 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election

8834647 weve found network chemistrys proactive approach innovative system design and affordability to be the perfect remedy to the concerns we had with our wireless network
8834648 we plan to make use of wireless applications in mission critical operations which are in compliance with hipaa regulations to do so we needed bullet proof security from a vendor that really understood our needs as well as the depth and breadth of the issues facing wireless networking network chemistry filled that prescription
8834649 large enterprises across all vertical markets are witnessing the incursion of 802 11 devices into their networks whether they are actively deploying or simply discovering employees who are experimenting on their own
8834650 in order to meet ever changing wireless security requirements vendors applications must be dynamic in nature to adapt to attacks enabling the enterprises deploying them to adapt like their attackers accomplishing this requires both the right tools and the right information
8834651 network chemistry has listened to the demands of enterprises regarding wireless network security and the imposing threat of malicious attacks
8834652 weve developed a nimble solution that delivers the functionality and affordability for any organization to snuff out wireless hackers before any damage is done rfprotect is the first solution that can be sized and priced to meet the needs of both small and large enterprises as hackers will attack no matter what size an organization is

8834666 who think that godliness is a means to financial gain but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with that people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs but you man of god flee from all this and pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance and gentleness
8834667 therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect that they too may obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory
8834668 i have become all things to all men so that by all possible means i might save some
8834669 for i am not seeking my own good but the good of many so that they may be saved

8834709 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8834710 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8834711 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8834712 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8834713 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8834714 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8834715 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8834716 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8834717 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8834718 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8834719 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8834721 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8834722 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8834723 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8834724 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

8834728 travesty the trial of slobodan milosevic and the corruption of international justice
8834729 a history of political trials from crales i to saddam hussein
8834730 victors justice by special courts or tribunals in the hague whose members both judge and jury understand that the outcome has already been decided
8834731 with international justice we are dealing with some of most fundamental questions of political life we are dealing with the questions of who makes the rules who has the right to rule and who adjudicates the rules these are the questions which go to the very essence of politics states are created around an agreement on who has the right to rule and who has the right to adjudicate and implement the rules
8834732 what is striking about these tribunals and their claim of right to rule is that they claim political power but at the same time they do not wish to assume any political responsibility when a state is created it affirms the right to rule the state has a control over its territory and thereby it has certain rights over the people who live on that territory but in retune for that right to rule it also undertakes obligations to protect the people who live there as a sort of contract between rulers and the ruled what i find unacceptable about the international tribunals is that they affirm the right to rule affirm the right to make rules to apply them and to adjudicate them but they dont take any corresponding obligations they dont take any obligation to protect or to govern in any way the peoples over whom they wield power
8834733 indeed it does adjudicate them and in many cases convicts them and sentences them but the yugoslav tribunal never bears any of the political consequences for the indictments that it issues or for the trials that it conducts
8834734 like all the international tribunals it is structurally separate from the people and the state over which it has power
8834735 the whole original purpose of the tribunal and the whole ideology behind it was that this was a war where crimes were being committed largely as they put it by the serbs
8834736 it is often claimed that war crimes tribunals prosecute only individuals and not whole nations this is fiction which cannot be sustained the reason why it is a fiction is that acts of war are by definition public acts war indeed is intelligible only as a political act and only as a collective public and not a private undertaking that is why throughout history people involved in conflict do support their countrymen and their fellow soldiers even though they are accused of atrocities that is why it isnt possible to separate the acts of individuals from the acts of the nation which they led in case of karadzic and other serbs at the hague they are being prosecuted only in their capacity as leaders of a nation they are not being persecuted in their capacity of private individuals
8834737 not at all comfortable with the political game of getting and staying elected of raising money in backroom deals and manipulating an electable image
8834738 and i think theres a real hunger in the party and in the country for someone whos gonna stand up for them stand up and fight for something

8834755 i ordered the blackened chicken alfredo and kevin had a cobb salad i never remember what i order especially for a lunch let alone one 18 years ago but duck made it memorable by how incredibly warm and generous he was
8834756 i was nobody and here was the starting center taking me out and showing me my new city
8834757 people called him duck and i liked it but i felt since he was larger than life he deserved an appropriate moniker after being around the fellas on the team for awhile you find out things about each of them
8834758 duck loved clothes like i do and because of his years in the league he had accumulated a heck of a wardrobe
8834759 i remember feeling like i was affecting his life no matter how small

8834787 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8834788 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8834789 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8834790 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8834791 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8834792 why mccain is right on russia and right on health care
8834793 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8834794 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8834795 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8834796 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8834797 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8834798 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8834799 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8834800 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8834801 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8834802 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8834803 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8834804 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8834805 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8834806 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8834807 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8834808 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8834809 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8834810 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8834811 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8834812 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8834813 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8834814 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8834815 little giggles like that is why i do this job
8834816 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8834817 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8834818 youre having a terrible day but you need to be here by 8am three days a week
8834819 what are your hobbies what do you like to do when not at school
8834820 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8834821 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8834822 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8834823 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8834824 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8834825 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8834826 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8834827 the ladies were more than ready to give me a great
8834828 this volume of young harlots is all about the things schoolgirls do when left to their own devices and what they think about when theyd rather be somewhere else
8834829 dressed the way they are in tight tops and short skirts theres not much left for the imagination the title is superb and like all of harmony films movies it features the best talent doing what they love and doing what they do best while being shot with cinematic flair
8834830 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8834831 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8834832 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8834833 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8834834 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8834835 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8834837 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8834838 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8834839 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8834840 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8834841 even my mom says it all the time still hows your shoulder
8834842 itll feel good to worry about something else worry about an opponent or stuff thats going on on the game field and not have to worry about my shoulder thats going to feel good
8834843 last year it helped us a lot seeing we can compete with some of the top teams in the country it opened everybodys eyes to realize we can do something special here
8834844 i wouldnt like to see him get hit but itll happen
8834845 thats just football i know t j s tough i know hes a tough individual hell get right back up
8834846 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
8834847 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
8834848 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
8834849 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
8834850 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
8834851 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for he added
8834852 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted
8834853 im just going to try to score because i know those guys dont want to run
8834854 father god this week as the world looks on help the leaders in this room create a civil dialogue about our future we need you god as individuals and also as a nation we need you to protect us from our enemies but also from ourselves because we are easily tempted toward apathy give us a passion to advance opportunities for the least of these for widows and orphans for single moms and children whose fathers have left give us the eyes to see them and the ears to hear them and hands willing to serve them help us serve people not just causes and stand up to specific injustices rather than vague notions give those in this room who have power along with those who will meet next week the courage to work together to finally provide health care to those who dont have any and a living wage so families can thrive rather than struggle help us figure out how to pay teachers what they deserve and give children an equal opportunity to get a college education help us figure out the balance between economic opportunity and corporate gluttony we have tried to solve these problems ourselves but they are still there we need your help father will you restore our moral standing in the world a lot of people dont like us but thats because they dont know the heart of the average american will you give us favor and forgiveness along with our allies around the world help us be an example of humility and strength once again lastly father unify us even in our diversity help us see how much we have in common and unify us not just in our ideas and in our sentiments but in our actions as we look around and figure out something we can do to help create an america even greater than the one we have come to cherish god we know that you are good thank you for blessing us in so many ways as americans i make these requests in the name of your son jesus who gave his own life against the forces of injustice let him be our example amen

8834879 has by far the most liberal program of any democratic nominee since george mcgovern in 1972
8834880 whether we win or lose were going to be in the same position on the ladder so its more about us getting our processes right and certainly the style but more importantly we thought we turned the corner a little last week as far as form for some individuals and as a team wed like to keep that going
8834881 weve got a lot of respect for the adelaide football club they really are a good honest side who just work hard for each other and even if they werent playing for a home final you know youre going to get a great contest from them so its a great lead in for us for finals theres no doubt
8834882 i think in the belief factor were better i think after last seasons disappointment we had a fairly solid pre season and it was a matter of getting some wins on the board to cement some belief
8834883 there was a bit of anxiety amongst the group going in to round one but having a victory early i think was a catalyst for us to get a good roll on to the next seven or eight weeks
8834884 we want to see a response from last week with the way we went about our footy
8834885 we were very disappointed and we should be because the way we went about it after quarter time was so far away from the way we want to play the way we want to be perceived and our desired style of play
8834886 we need to correct that really quickly because it wont be anywhere near good enough in finals

8834899 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8834900 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
8834901 some authorities recognized their pay phone was not being used but wanted to keep their traditional red telephone box on the village green for aesthetic reasons because its part of the british heritage

8834913 for qualitative research the advantage of adsam is that it can be easily executed in a 60 minute idi each exercise only takes 30 seconds to complete on the quantitative side it can be completed very efficiently and deliver more robust and usable emotional segments which feed into segmentation analysis and or message optimisation studies to aid decision making

8834915 the commencement of our new drilling campaign within the shallow fields production unit at the mtsare khevi field has progressed very well and we are encouraged by the results and efficient pace of our early work in this new development program as drilling continues our rolling development plan calls for these shallow wells to be completed and brought into production as quickly as possible in order to ramp up production from the field as it represents an important near term value component within our overall portfolio
8834916 these are carrefours best first half results since 2005 this strong performance attests to the relevance of our multi format single brand strategy on an international scale the group has robust fundamentals with a business model focused primarily on food a balanced portfolio of formats leading positions in the countries where it operates and a sound balance sheet these strengths along with our competitive advantages such as the power of our brand and our real estate potential give us the means to forge ahead and create greater value in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives

8834941 i survived because i was too young to be a good swordsman i mainly ran from behind a tree i witnessed a famous old warrior surrounded by enemy swordsmen fighting for his life the warrior kept twisting and shifting his body placing his body under the enemy sword in an angle in which it was difficult for the blade to slice the body he kept placing his body in that angle as the swords kept coming down on him from where i stood it looked as though he was dancing a graceful dance suddenly i noticed that he was in a very different position i did not see it happening because it was done so gradually and subtlely but somehow he removed himself from the center of the circle of swords his enemies were now behind him after the battle he showed me his clothes and his body all his clothes were shredded into pieces but his body had only small cuts he called scratches thats when he taught me how to place your body under the blades
8834942 i was just looking around thinking where would they all fit
8834943 i barely have room for me and my three kids
8834944 i can hear it when my neighbors play the radio
8834945 were working leads to determine how they got into the country
8834946 jaha d r gick dom okej nu r han p femte raden och kissar igen nu hostade n gon p samma rad
8834947 i perceive there will be litigation in regards to that and so any time we do anything with any meat theres litigation in regard to it
8834948 were all enjoying senate bill 2s litigation right now so thats why were saying that
8834949 it certainly is an issue that is undecided but we intend to make sure that we have policy in place that is fully compliant with statute
8834950 sometimes it takes months sometimes it takes several years thats not uncommon
8834951 shipley do nuts a family owned business has been a part of the houston community for over 72 years we are committed to good citizenship and are continuing to cooperate with government authorities on matters of immigration compliance
8834952 we have a ways to go but were a lot closer today than we have been and were seeing the results
8834953 were at a 10 year low right now with apprehensions
8834954 weve tried a lot of different things here but one of the mistakes that i believe weve made is trying to eat the whole apple at once
8834955 there are so many tentacles to this thing that you can be a part of that economic impact but it might not come directly from the nfl pipeline
8834956 the nfl is our client and were going to do whatever we can to make sure they are satisfied
8834957 its very important to take care of our client if everything works out when its all said and done and its a successful event then the opportunity for it to return is very high
8834958 were in the market waiting for the right timing its a matter of making sure we believe we are getting a fair price and were not paying more than we need to
8834959 the agent responded that edwards is adding to his calendar and that the fee has gone up
8834960 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8834961 in all my years in politics weve seen progress made but this feels like what the astronaut said one small step for man one huge step for mankind
8834962 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8834963 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8834964 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8834965 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8834966 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8834967 i dont mind paying for breakfast and i dont mind paying twice what the breakfast was worth but you have to wonder why
8834968 i can take a coffee mug but not a t shirt or the other way around
8834969 dealing with the tear gas was easier than trying to figure out the ethics laws
8834970 it does require more effort on my part but i want to make my district proud
8834971 my district is a little more hypersensitive about that because of jim black
8834972 if a lawmaker crosses the borders of north carolina its not that the lobbying laws no longer apply
8834973 the public doesnt distinguish between being wined and dined at conventions or here in raleigh im glad legislators are being mindful
8834974 arent doing it for legislators theyre doing it for a larger group
8834975 you wonder how much sense it makes to segregate or separate elected officials
8834976 when you get legislation like that you need to figure out where you need to tweak it
8834977 the citizens of north carolina expect you to have common sense
8834978 if you want to sit in the governors seat there is a process for that
8834979 im supporting mccain because i think our country needs somebody who has the depth of experience proven talent and lots of leadership training
8834980 ooops nobody told me i was in a cheap country where i do not need to tip
8834981 ooops i forgot i came to thailand for a cheap vacation
8834982 i believe the war was a bad idea and poorly planned at the highest levels
8834983 despite my views i as most marines would proudly serve my country again
8834984 our president with the support of senator mccain has made decisions that have set america on a course unsustainable in dollars lives and military readiness
8834985 president bush made a disastrous gamble in iraq in 2003 now senator mccain proposes to double down with money and troops we cannot afford to lose
8834986 planning a reasonable and responsible drawing down of the war
8834987 staffing organizational structure the competence and effectiveness of managers and supervisors at all levels and all other components of hospital management and operational activities
8834988 that additional comfort level that another set of eyes are looking at all situations
8834989 were trying to get ready for league play and were playing a high level to get ready
8834990 honestly we hadnt won a game the year before and were looking to get off on the right foot
8834991 thats no disrespect to lowry but we wanted to ease into the season you schedule your preseason games based on what your needs are
8834992 but it kind of backfired because we got away with some mistakes against lowry that we didnt later in the year
8834993 because we got away with them early we didnt really learn from them
8834994 it makes it tremendously difficult to set up a schedule
8834995 wed rather play teams that are local as opposed to out of state like that 5 hour bus trip we made last year to yreka calif
8834996 there was no opening for us to play a 4a team and you have to take games where you can get them
8834997 its a real feather in their cap if they can knock off the bigger school
8834998 it means a lot more to beat an in town 4a team
8834999 when we beat spanish springs two years ago that was special
8835000 its always disappointing to lose but we didnt feel demeaned when we came up short
8835001 if we play a team and they beat us then they were the better team that day
8835002 thats something you have to take and move on no matter if its a 2a team or a 3a team
8835003 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8835004 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8835005 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8835006 when obama is elected that means nobody will ever ask again do you think texas is ready
8835007 just because hes running people will be more confident about african americans in leadership roles
8835008 to me this is a tremendous moment for young people
8835009 they never knew segregation but they know what we went through to get to barack obama
8835010 state legislators have proven they will not address state public education finance unless there is a court order or pending lawsuit
8835011 at this time no such lawsuit exists so districts will run out of funding
8835012 go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less
8835013 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8835014 there are more motorcycles out children are not in school there are more people in cars traveling and in a relatively short time there are three holiday weekends
8835015 dont drink and drive and please refuse to ride with a driver who has had too much to drink we wont tolerate it and neither should you
8835016 certainly when you have fewer miles traveled you have fewer crashes
8835017 id like to think the higher gas prices would put us out of business as far as injuries and fatalities but it isnt going to
8835018 we do have a lot of triumphs but we do see a lot of tragedies and torn lives
8835019 we hope that the decisions people make are the right ones because they might be the most important ones of their lives or the lives of other people
8835020 our call volume has kicked up from some of our lenders looking for another source for down payment help
8835021 those programs were not part of the solution they were part of the problem
8835022 we began to see a pattern in seller funded dpas where if we had to foreclose the property value was not worth what it was when we made the loan
8835023 were back to core programs like the 97 percent financed fha mortgage
8835024 viene a abarcar el mbito tutelado anteriormente por los reales decretos 1332 1994 de 20 de junio y 994 1999 de 11 de junio teniendo en cuenta la necesidad de fijar criterios aplicables a los ficheros y tratamientos de datos personales no automatizados por otra parte la atribuci n de funciones a la por la ley 34 2002 de 11 de julio de servicios de la sociedad de la informaci n y de comercio electr nico y la ley 32 2003 de 3 de noviembre general de telecomunicaciones obliga a desarrollar tambi n los procedimientos para el ejercicio de la potestad sancionadora por la agencia
8835025 embedded video as i cannot find enough time to care for this plugin any more plugin development wont be continued the current version will be available as long as it works for the current wordpress version
8835026 ill bet you it was someone connected with the army air forces
8835027 they had to have the materials to make this and i doubt somebody in the infantry would
8835028 the officers brought it in and didnt give it a second thought
8835029 it was just a gun theyre in their 20s and 30s to me it runs a little deeper i recognized immediately that the photo was from the 40s
8835030 if we can find the woman then we can find out who the man was who owned this gun
8835031 id like to find the nearest museum near them and put it in there with his and her whole story
8835032 and if i can find out where it was stolen then i can put a case on the guy we took it from for stolen property thatd be good too
8835033 i dont want to put other people down because the finger could be pointed at me too but there are some huge staff weaknesses when it comes to not putting budgets together or not approving them correctly
8835034 ultimately the budget would be the managing directors job but we didnt believe he had the skill set in that job
8835035 i would certainly go if people thought i should step back
8835036 i didnt think it was working i made those feelings known
8835037 but it is not one persons ballet company the president or the chairman doesnt run the ballet
8835038 but having a balanced budget on paper is not the same as being financially stable
8835039 robin was a participant and attended every finance committee meeting since i became managing director so was ben stevenson she had full and complete reports during that entire period
8835040 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8835041 college drop out who established his reputation as a technology wunderkind with cupertino california based apple
8835042 based on one of the biggest horror icons of all time
8835043 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
8835044 i am having a love affair with striker he and todd are the best duo on tv today
8835045 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense
8835046 ive disagreed with miss clarks policies because im not a socialist but ive always admired her intelligence integrity and hard work
8835047 tragically shes now trapped in winston peters web of deceit and deception helen clark has put power over principle and new zealand is now the loser
8835048 miss clark hasnt been prepared to do whats right sack a minister who has misled her and the country and who is under investigation by the serious fraud office
8835049 all the prime minister has done is allowed him to stand down as though his behaviour is some temporary aberration
8835050 we know experts have concluded that mmr has an excellent safety record so one of the areas we need to investigate is whether the low take up is merely down to apathy or is still influenced by memories of the adverse publicity in the 1990s when it was linked to all sorts of health problems including autism
8835051 we cannot be complacent about this and the announcement this month by the department of health that it was making extra vaccines and more funds available to help local health trusts vaccinate every child up to the age of 18 against measles is welcome news and will boost the work we began in essex earlier this year
8835052 the mmr vaccine is a very safe vaccination with more than 500 million doses having been given in 90 countries over the last 30 years suffolk homes
8835053 i think it is a load of rubbish and it is him trying to get the sympathy of the people of suffolk and beyond they have got the right person we sat in the court and listened to all the evidence against him and i cannot possibly see how he is innocent
8835054 i feel anger towards him and sheer hatred and will never forgive him as long as i live he did not look in court as though he felt any sorrow at all there was no remorse he is a disgusting object
8835055 we are left having to bring up a little boy i had to sit and tell my little grandson that his mum had been murdered by a vile creature he has got to live with this all his life and get through high school and we do not know what children are going to say to him he will never get away from it
8835056 how does steve wright think we all feel as a family and how does he think this little boy feels
8835057 he should do the decent thing and tell us what he did to our daughters and where everything happened it would help because i think all the time where did he pick her up and where did he take her
8835058 i think he is feeling sorry for himself because with a bit of luck he will never get out
8835059 but at least he is alive and can do things like watch tv and eat food none of the girls can do that
8835060 if we still had the death penalty like we did years ago he would not be alive and he would not have a chance to say what he said in the letter
8835061 how can he say that he is innocent when there is so much evidence against him it was not just chance evidence it was calculated and done well by the police for him to say he can prove his innocence how can he
8835062 it has turned my stomach my heart goes out to the families of the other murdered girls because we can never replace our loved ones suffolk homes
8835063 its unbelievable the black horse is a lovely old building and used to be the busiest pub in the village
8835064 when the new people moved in they advertised it as a bikers venue and the character changed they used to refer to villagers as civilians
8835065 what has happened to the pub is a terrible shame
8835066 they were also unhappy about drivers using the car park to turn round and so blocked it off with 20 gold painted aluminium barrels to keep cars out
8835067 the only people to benefit from the goings on are the villages other two pubs the anchor and the swan both of which are much busier these days
8835068 the whole community is concerned at the changes that had taken place at the pub especially the odd colour scheme
8835069 it used to be very popular but these people attracted the biker crowd with live music
8835070 we have not repainted the pub we have simply used coloured wood preservative to protect it
8835071 there is an enforcement case open against the black horse in stratford st mary and we are in the process of sorting the matter out
8835072 grs inns that own the pub have been given until the beginning of october to get the building repainted back to the original colours
8835073 if they fail to do so we will serve them with an enforcement notice which will involve the council stating the breach and what is required to be done they would be given a certain time in which to comply we hope that they will
8835074 if i had the slightest doubt in my mind that steve had carried out these murders after seeing those pictures then i would walk and never speak to him again in my life
8835075 for such a high profile case one of the biggest trials in british legal history to be held on the back door of where it happened is unfair
8835076 myself and my two sisters bumped into two jury members as the trial was going on while they were shopping it is impossible to say that they would not be swayed when they could bump into the families of the girls on a daily basis
8835077 the bittern has suffered an ill fated history in the uk having endured extinction once and having been on the verge of extinction again in the late 1990s
8835078 we werent prepared to accept a second extinction of the bittern so we launched a rescue bid which has been so successful that a wide range of other wildlife has benefited too there are too many threatened species in the world and the turning around of the uks bittern population shows what can be achieved with a combination of practical determination proper research and appropriate funding
8835079 it will be a healthier situation when more birds breed inland and reliance on minsmere and other vulnerable coastal sites is reduced

8835120 queremos que durante la liturgia quede claro que se trata de un acto cat lico para cat licos que no se hagan generalizaciones respecto a las v ctimas en la misa ni se use el nombre de rub n y que no se refiera por igual a las 154 personas que perdieron la vida
8835121 aunque para la sociedad pueda parecer que el tema del funeral cat lico es una cuesti n menor no lo es as para las v ctimas sobre todo para el caso de nuestro compa ero que ten a profundas creencias religiosas no respetarlas ser a ofensivo e incluso humillante para su familia

8835172 a wild joy ride deep into the hinterlands of japanese culture society and radical politics
8835173 just how close are the links between the arthouse and the grindhouse in japan read about the ins and outs of japanese censorship from the wartime onwards and how topless deep sea diving girls came to woo local audiences in the 50s learn how a tv nature documentary maker ended up helming nude female tarzan movies and how 60s mavericks k ji wakamatsu and masao adachi met up with john and yoko at cannes while on the way to the golan heights to make a film about palestinian revolutionaries how deep throats harry reems wound up in tokyo starring in a zany sex comedy about a penis transplant gone awry and how one of japans most famous literary figures ended up the subject of the countrys first gay porno movie how one of nikkatsus leading directors went it alone to make a film about powerboat racing and ended up in the bad books of the yakuza and how the anti bush sex farce horny home tutor teachers love juice came to be re titled as the glamorous life of sachiko hanai and became one of the most talked about japanese films of recent years playing at over twenty international film festivals

8835180 everybody else at the university of montana thinks youre a joke award
8835181 weve been to more than 100 countries but this is the first time weve had this happen
8835182 were not a chartered boat so we could face a 50 000 nz132 000 fine if we break the law
8835183 it seems there were safety issues but weve got a boat here thats been around the world twice its one of the safest boats there is
8835184 its quite frustrating health and safety in this country is sort of out of control but when you think weve been shot at by colombians then i suppose this is small fry
8835185 one of the local charter boat skippers complained saying it was competition for them but on investigation that didnt turn out to be the case
8835186 in an area like torbay where youve got existing operators who have paid out for licences it doesnt take long before resentment builds up if someone is not following the rules
8835187 if you give the skipper something back for the trip like a meal thats payment in kind

8835194 the character is always portrayed as a fighter for truth and justice im just glad she doesnt have a whip
8835195 shes not supposed to be a role model shes a toy
8835196 you want to talk about role models what about mr potato head he sits around and doesnt do anything then you put his angry eyes on and hes angry maybe he should come with his own prozac
8835197 the first black presidential nominee ever of a major party in history
8835198 youre all a bunch of victims and losers no matter how hard you work your lives cant possibly get any better unless you elect me so i can take back the undeserved wealth of the lucky few and spend it on government programs that will completely transform your lives
8835199 government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8835200 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper
8835201 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease

8835208 we were called to the scene of the accident at about 5 45pm
8835209 at the moment it would appear that the lorry has left the carriageway and gone into the ditch and then burst into flames
8835210 we do not know why the vehicle left the carriageway at this time
8835211 our crew treated the casualty at the scene anaesthetising him in order to do so it was a 50 year old man with severe facial injuries and burns
8835212 was the one record he was certain would still be around when he died
8835213 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8835214 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8835215 i have smelt it at home and in various other places it is all over cambridge
8835216 it is revolting it wafts into the house when the windows are open
8835217 it is awful it seems extraordinary that they can make a pong like that and cover the whole of cambridge thats tens of thousands of people who are inconvenienced by it
8835218 if an industry made a smell like that it would be closed
8835219 all our bio products at the end process are returned to agriculture compared to pig manure or animal manure it is much more highly treated and monitored
8835220 once it is with the farmer its up to them a lot of spreading is going on at this time of the year
8835221 well we have a half a gallon of water a few diet cokes a bag of oreo cookies and a box of fruit loops i think we should probably get some other stuff if were going to ride out the storm
8835222 implications not only for the local area but for the region
8835223 we believe this is most likely to be achieved through a review of the regional spatial strategy rss which involves a wide range of organisations and interest groups in the region
8835224 so many groups and councils were against it and also our mps there was no local support for it this is a great day for local democracy
8835225 i congratulate tesco on the decision to withdraw from the eco towns process following our joint discussions with them
8835226 we are very pleased they accept the best way to proceed with planning for new developments is through the existing planning mechanism of the rss
8835227 this is excellent news and follows on from our talks with tesco where they were left in no doubt about our feelings on hanley grange being promoted through the eco towns process
8835228 we have always argued the eco town process was flawed and ignored the correct procedures
8835229 jim paice and i went to see sir terry leahy chief executive of tesco we are pleased he asked his senior people to meet our colleagues he was keen to ensure tesco listened to the voice of the people this is a tremendous outcome for our campaign
8835230 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
8835231 this is horrendous for me every time i open a bill it reminds me of my fathers death
8835232 as soon as he died the caravan park told me to call the council to get the ownership of the mobile home transferred over to them which i did
8835233 i have called the council numerous times and sent them death certificates but i am still receiving bills
8835234 wednesdays bill was 632 but i was given a 50 per cent discount as the mobile home has been empty
8835235 but they are still demanding 316 28 for the time between july 21 2008 and march 31 2009 within seven days or else i will be in court which is devastating
8835236 whilst we cannot go into individual cases when a property becomes empty it is exempt from council tax for six months
8835237 if a property is in such a poor state of repair that it is uninhabitable then the exemption is extended to 12 months
8835238 after that time a charge of 50 per cent of the full council tax charge must be paid by the owner
8835239 the charge will normally be payable in monthly instalments and will end if the property is demolished
8835240 anyone in a position or owning an empty property and intending to sell or demolish it should let us know by calling 08450 450064
8835241 mrs duell rang us after mr arnolds death and we told her to call scdc and tell them that we were now the owners of the home which we do with all deaths here
8835242 we have not heard from her since so we thought everything was sorted but it sounds to me like some information has been lost along the way
8835243 i have grown a few strange looking tomatoes which have bits that stick out and look like noses or faces but never a tomato as big as this
8835244 i think i get so many different sizes and shapes because i grow them from seeds which have an international mix and are inter pollinated these are mongrel tomato seeds not thoroughbreds
8835245 i like them on bread with a bit of salt and pepper and some spring onions my wife makes chutney from them both green and red but we dont make them into sauce i think thats better out of a bottle
8835246 my son was in the cambridge evening news 30 years ago for growing a sunflower that was 12 foot high maybe its something in the soil
8835247 i have seen the beef tomatoes they grow in england but mine is bigger

8835252 i sent my bus pass back to gordon brown and i got two letters from him that didnt tell me anything i am very annoyed i used to drive but i cant now i have been here 11 years and that was my one bit of freedom
8835253 the excuse is that they are not used but thats a load of rubbish im a bit peeved as you can imagine im not doing this for me its affected a lot of older people including a woman in her 80s who got on it every week

8835257 in this life we either take our own perspective as absolute and so become prone to wanting to tear down others or we accept that we are each but a small part of this world and we must work and take risks to get anything in it

8835262 it has been several days now and still we havent heard from police its not good enough
8835263 there is no evidence a crime has taken place and nobody has complained they have been a victim of crime unless we have further details we have very little to investigate
8835264 i want a full explanation of what happened here why a text was sent and what the level of staffing was that night i am likely to want to pursue formal action
8835265 her friend called the police at about 12 30am and was told the crime was a low priority and they didnt have enough officers to deal with it saying they would call later
8835266 my daughter sat up all night waiting terrified the men would come back as they had house keys we had to break our holiday and come home and change the locks she was so scared the police didnt turn up until about 6pm
8835267 there was an unacceptable delay in contacting the caller to explain the delay in responding to her call and we apologise for this
8835268 in this case there was no risk to life and no crime in action therefore it was prioritised accordingly
8835269 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different
8835270 one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible honestly i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out

8835275 as a team we look forward to travelling weve got a pretty good record so theres no fear for us whatever time of the year it is
8835276 weve got a very good record especially over in perth its a good opportunity for us guys to get away from melbourne and play good footy
8835277 its in our control if we win were in the top four until the kangaroos play at least so its up to us
8835278 freo have a lot of blokes who are retiring so theyre going to be out to beat us
8835279 ive been in that position before when collingwood was down the bottom of the ladder where youre playing just to knock a team off and wreck their finals chances
8835280 theyll be fired up so its a matter of us taking them on early
8835281 were a pretty young side at the moment and all those young guys getting an opportunity are making the most of it
8835282 were back to playing the footy we like to play and that is intimidating a team putting the pressure on and making the most of turnovers
8835283 were just playing as a team and not relying on too many individuals
8835284 the amount of work theyve been doing theyve still been training and doing everything with us

8835290 one in nine people using another persons wi fi is a staggering amount you wouldnt expect that many people to go into a neighbours house and use their shower
8835291 the consequences can be severe its bad enough your neighbours can use your internet connection freely but this becomes far more threatening if someone uses your connection for criminal or improper activity
8835292 this could be accessing your internet connection to download obscene material gathering personal information to defraud you or even stealing your identity
8835293 people are learning to be safe online but those using wireless can undo all that by leaving their network unprotected an unsecured internet connection is just the same as leaving your front door open

8835384 the more things change the more they stay the same
8835385 its a simple question sebastian im not exactly looking for the secret formula here
8835386 the negatives far outweigh the positives and you being the calculating character you are i would think youd abide by your atypical formulaic approach
8835387 yet here you are striking match after match as if spending a pockets worth of change on a goddamn torch is going to undo the fibers of your world
8835388 you above most know me well enough to know ive never been a big fan of conventionalism johnnyboy
8835389 ive fought many a battle bent many an ear and worn many a ridiculous article of clothing to keep as far away from that monotonous moving myriad of souls across that street as possible and i cant exactly count myself among the unique sporting your typical flick of the thumb producers of flames now can i
8835390 theres a fine line between unconventional and stubborn chum if your case is indeed the case whos to say jim joe nicotine down the street isnt on the same path to flammable discrimination as you perhaps he believes his zippo is the authority in the fire party mainly because abiding by the limits of the matchbook is an ancient practice the likes of which that flick of the thumb has long since done away with
8835391 its not a matter of superiority among incendiary devices its the mindset that one should have when they make the effort to stand by their belief and mine just happening to be my affinity for the simple match im not going to slug it out with mr nicotine down the block because i dont have the luxury of pulling off that light the zippo off your knee trick nor do i believe he has any basis to down me because i carry a book instead of a bic it would appear that the world around us has let the simple authoritative act of holding steady to their beliefs and desires take a backseat to keeping silent for the sake of conserving the peaceful silence theyve grown so accustomed to
8835392 your basis in this argument has nothing to do with the manner in which the world at large lights its cigarettes but the world itself somehow youve managed to turn the simple differences between a match and a lighter into theoretical rhetoric on a global scale if amy in holland uses a match for her hookah at 4 in the afternoon and brad in tokyo buys a blinking flicker at 2 in the morning what time will their trains collide is that about the long and short of it
8835393 not exactly given the fact that their respective time zones are about 7 hours apart
8835394 well when you put it that way i guess a little arithmetic couldnt hurt the issue i suppose i just have a different way of raging against this age of utter acceptance i dont like the idea of the world around me simply sitting back in its overmodernized overpriced proverbial chair and taking whats coming to it when whats coming to it is more of the same mindless babble and bullshit we deserve better than this but what makes it a truly sad occasion is that while just about everyone knows just how fucking skewered the state of affairs has become they stand vigil at their absent posts merely hoping for a change or three before the floor beneath them gives out and gives way to the bitter end
8835395 and maybe we do deserve it for all the nothing weve done to alter our fates
8835396 and even if youre a person of faith you cant blame it on god because as much as some people would like to think its the creator who needs to take responsibility both in fault and in duty he said himself that we humanity have to make our own fates like every other beast he put on the planet opposable thumbs dont entitle us to a free pass out of hell weve got the power to fix it just as we had the power to fuck it all up in the first place
8835397 so to sum up that tirade your plan to stick it firmly to the fools responsible for the state of the world around us is to spend the rest of your nicotine ridden life by striking matches
8835398 ill tell you what it may not scream rebellion but it certainly benefits my sensitive thumbs
8835399 you certainly know how to take a stand stranger i couldnt help but catch a few words of that debate you two undertook
8835400 i myself never had any particular favoritisms when it comes to lighting my tobacco to me fire is fire

8835447 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8835448 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8835449 it is why i stand here tonight because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8835450 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8835451 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8835452 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8835453 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8835454 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8835455 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change
8835456 you see we democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country
8835457 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put away a little extra money at the end of each month so that you can someday watch your child receive her diploma
8835458 we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work
8835459 the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
8835460 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now so let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8835461 change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8835462 unlike john mccain i will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our jobs overseas and i will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in america
8835463 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
8835464 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8835465 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8835466 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them
8835467 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8835468 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8835469 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home

8835574 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
8835575 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
8835576 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
8835577 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
8835578 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
8835579 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true

8835584 all i can say is that there is massive foreign interest many european us and asian companies have knocked on my door to say they want to invest in our land
8835585 agriculture is key because it will increase jobs and help our economy grow as a whole
8835586 i started with nothing just a small plot of land in the vale do cavaco some years ago
8835587 but i am now selling 4 000 tonnes of bananas each year to luanda and in two years this number should double
8835588 this is just the beginning of a revolution in the farming sector we need new players to teach angolan farmers the technology and know how to increase much needed production
8835589 there are still some that fear the elections especially after what happened in zimbabwe and kenya but if the september vote goes well i have no doubt we will be bombarded with projects
8835590 this time there is no way the elections will lead to warfare
8835591 angolans have suffered too much get here nobody wants violence
8835592 weve been analysing their financial statements and business environment to find out whether there will be any synergy
8835593 the value of a possible deal will not be greater than two billion dollars
8835594 real net exports are destined to be a major drag on economic growth in quarter two
8835595 the main point is that the u s is going to have a stronger year than we thought and a stronger year than canada
8835596 the huizhou project will further increase the energy supply in the pearl river delta in guangdong one of chinas economic powerhouses
8835597 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8835598 our fundamental task remains to secure long term debt restructuring and we will continue to work with our lending groups to achieve this goal
8835599 it ogling online job postings started when i realized my current job is like a dung beetle trying to mate with an epileptic cow
8835600 the construction contracts will be awarded by conventional public tender
8835601 we have no intention at this time to introduce a pre qualification process or any other variation on the traditional public tendering approach utilized by the city
8835602 given the amount of operational co ordination that will be required and the number of technical design issues that will need to be addressed we want to keep our contractual relationship with the successful contractors as streamlined as possible
8835603 the d building biofilter will be proven state of the art and based on extensive pilot studies conducted on site
8835604 the ashbridges bay facility is large and complex and therefore our focus is on reliability
8835605 the emphasis throughout will be on selecting and designing based on the best available technologies that have proven records of performance
8835606 when work commences it will include a heavy emphasis on all the traditional civil mechanical and electrical disciplines required to work in a wastewater plant
8835607 all the work will be tendered to general contractors and we dont anticipate any specialty contracts at this time some of the contracts could include asbestos abatement as a significant portion of the work for example as part of the aeration tank emission air contract but this will be left with the general contractors to coordinate
8835608 obviously the least costly solution is to upgrade the lagoons at the existing location
8835609 however just because its the lowest cost solution doesnt mean it kills the option of having a music festival locate there if we can find funding from other sources for the sewage system
8835610 but the population of niagara on the lake is growing and were estimating that we should increase the capacity of the lagoons by 2013 so were moving forward with our studies
8835611 it was part of the american landing zone between one mile creek and two mile creek in the battle of fort george on may 27th 1813 where the lagoons empty into lake ontario is right at two mile creek the other side of the lagoon is carolinian forest that was bought by the canadian military in 1908 as camp niagara and actively used for training until the late 1960s the military ceased using it in 2000 but since they once used it for small arms rifles pistols machine guns and as a grenade range they have to clean it up and check for unexploded ordnance before they hand it back to us
8835612 fifty years ago the lagoon site property was used as a town dump everybody finds it interesting now wed love to have it rehabilitated by the bicentennial of the beginning of the war of 1812
8835613 weve got a beach thats eroding thats being eaten away right now
8835614 it is affecting the way people are living what theyre used to
8835615 one of the biggest obstacles we had to overcome was handling the material that is pumped to the facility on a daily basis during the shut down of the primary and secondary digesters
8835616 the digesters were taken down for new pipe installation cleaning and fabrication installation of a new diameter primary digester lid we tackled the material dewatering by mobilizing a temporary belt press on site with the capacity to squeeze the water from 400m3 day of raw sludge running five to six days a week
8835617 although we reduced the size of the original buildings square footage by about one third
8835618 the design of the building and the treatment process allows space for the addition of the removed processes or for future expansion
8835619 we wanted to meet all the current regulations and provide and anticipate any potential future changes in direction in the water treatment regulations
8835620 there are three basic alternatives which are available to treat wastewater
8835621 the traditional one has been chlorine but the problem is that chlorine forms chloramines when it reacts with any ammonia residual in the wastewater effluent and chloramines are particularly toxic to fish
8835622 part of the municipal wastewater strategy of the canadian council of ministers of the environment is to reduce the use of chlorine and to reduce the potential discharge of chloramines another alternative to that is ultraviolet uv disinfection which is being used in some parts of the country and a third is ozonation
8835623 ozone is generated on site using ozone generators supplied with electrical power and of course montreal has access to relatively large quantities of cheap electrical power due to quebec hydro
8835624 the advantage of using ozone as a disinfectant is that it is also believed to reduce the quantities of pharmaceutical and personal care product residuals in the water its an extremely powerful oxidizer which causes these chemical residuals to break up and be decomposed
8835625 ozonation has really only come into play in the past two or three years as a wastewater treatment so this project puts montreal in the category of world leader from an association perspective we encourage all cities to make this kind of investment
8835626 the exact layout of the new building will depend on the type of ozone injection system thats considered most effective in our performance tests
8835627 its a principle of law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8835628 this is an exciting moment for us all as the acquisition will give us greater impetus to continue innovating in the online environment and digital journalism and to build on the multimedia platform we already have in place

8835641 the democratic platform on the first day of the convention was somewhat vague
8835642 thats been the big criticism from republicans that hes all show and no substance
8835643 if voters dont know who he is after this they never will
8835644 you can expect tomorrow that republicans are going to criticise everything the democratic party said tonight
8835645 weve got to get into the habit of defending ourselves
8835646 i hope the countrys above that above negative ads and that they will vote not out of fear
8835647 its so positive rather than the politics of fear its the politics of optimism even republicans are tired of the fear of the warmongering
8835648 he said that were here as americans not as democrats he played how hard times really are but said we can change

8835682 elvis is fine now and should be out of the icu soon
8835683 this is a remarkable feat by elvis although he was just on fluid during the 26 hours of non stop swimming elvis was absolutely stable barring complaints of body ache and we sprayed some pain killers on his body for relief
8835684 swimming in india is still taken as a recreation sport and hence the idea to undertake this marathon swim i am happy that i was able to accomplish my target and hope my effort helps in encouraging the younger generation to take up swimming seriously
8835685 i sincerely hope the authorities and sponsors would take the sport seriously now
8835686 we hope elvis feat would be an inspiration for the younger generation
8835687 the entire event was organised by the family and well wishers of elvis although the assam board of sports supported the marathon swim
8835688 since his appointment as president he has never thought about the people of afghanistan rather he is bent upon appeasing his foreign masters
8835689 ive seen a kingdom the rulers backed by russia the mujahideen government and taliban but this man karzai is the weakest ruler
8835690 the most unpopular man is in power one who has never been seen at public places for the last five years he is living in his highly guarded palace how can he serve the nation
8835691 we have to see whether the us wants karzai to continue as he has completely failed to deliver according to the wishes of people of afghanistan and the alliance isaf
8835692 he is fast losing his friends and i am sure after president george bush steps down in january next year karzai will be completely left alone and will be dumped by the new us administration
8835693 the governments have done nothing for us neither the mujahdeen taliban nor president karzai we have no water no electricity and are living in a miserable condition
8835694 you cant imagine how we were living during the taliban era
8835695 i would say that nato should stay in my country until taliban forces are eliminated still we are living under threat it was a nightmare and if they again came to power i would prefer to kill myself rather than live under taliban
8835696 hijab should be my choice i like to cover my head and body according to islamic tradition but i dont want someone else to tell me to do so
8835697 as long as karzai or some other person appointed by the us is in power and the isaf troops are in afghanistan we will continue to develop
8835698 and this is only because the us is controlling our government and economy which to me is not bad
8835699 i am a contented man now my adopted homeland has done justice to me my assailants are in jail america has a better judicial system than india
8835700 i passed out and when i came back to my senses i was in an ambulance
8835701 they were drunk and i sued the bar which had served them excess alcohol it was called villa rousseau the verdict is expected any time now and they will have to compensate me for the damage
8835702 i remember the day the gurdwara was attacked i saw it on new york one channel which is a minority channel in the evening it was a big building and smoke was billowing out of its ornate portals
8835703 i immediately telephoned the punjabi durbar it is a social networking centre which provides lists of 10 sikh contacts to every volunteer in two hours we had mobilised 5 000 sikh volunteers they rushed to the shrine and the mayor of new york city reached too the firemen doused the blaze in two hours
8835704 he had left his passport inside and had gone to fetch it
8835705 with the years the horrors have faded the educated americans now know the difference between sikhs and muslims they can distinguish between the turbans the schoolchildren are being taught about the sikh way of life it is much easier to cope with stray instances of racial crime now
8835706 even the train driver who managed to save the lives of 500 people at the time when the twin towers of the world trade organisation were burning has changed faith he is a sikh now and his children are studying in amritsar
8835707 i am taking her back to the us she need not fear

8835715 there have been stray incidents of violence in parts of kandhamal
8835716 mobs have blocked roads in several places and police are trying to clear them
8835717 although 4 000 policemen have been deployed in kandhamal district which is the worst hit hindu and christian rioters have clashed in several places we have arrested at least 137 people in the district since saturday
8835718 policemen have been ordered to shoot rioters at sight and curfew is in force in all major towns of kandhamal security forces have been taking out flag marches in several areas
8835719 as per our estimate 10 000 christian families have fled to the forests after their houses were burnt and they were attacked by rioters over 4 000 people have been injured and more than 20 000 houses have been burnt
8835720 it is an emotional and spontaneous reaction of people to the killing of swami laxamanananda saraswati
8835721 people are very angry and the government needs to immediately arrest the christian militants who killed swamiji
8835722 unlike in the south actors in north india like amitabh bachchan dharmendra and rajesh khanna dont bring with them any new aspiration
8835723 they dont represent regional nationalism they are not a success
8835724 i feel that a lot of stars join politics because they are swayed by others they are told they are popular so they can join politics
8835725 i feel it depends upon the individuals and their motivation
8835726 people all over india are looking for alternatives to existing power set ups so chiranjeevis entry into politics comes as no surprise
8835727 amitabh bachchan was a disaster but sunil dutt was so good as a politician maybe because amitabhs heart was not in it whereas sunil dutt was always concerned about social issues
8835728 that is why one sees stars from the hindi film world mostly only during elections
8835729 for some stars approaching retirement as actors politics is a surefire way of extending their public life for the more serious star politicians its a way of using their popularity to further a political agenda but only the really committed succeed
8835730 in south india these actors bring with them a regional nationalist flavour and try to fulfil middle class aspirations
8835731 while chiranjeevi may gather a sizeable number of votes it has to be remembered that he will have to face two well entrenched political outfits the congress and tdp telugu desam party
8835732 if one has to go by the law of averages indications are that chiranjeevi may split the anti congress votes as he is projecting himself as a clear contender for the chief ministers post and actually end up helping tdp
8835733 the biggest advantage chiranjeevi has is that he is a very straight person and corruption would be the last thing in his mind he has enough money otherwise
8835734 the number speaks for itself indian students have a high visa compliance rate and they are a very important part of the australias 12 5 billion us 11 billion education export industry
8835735 as many as 47 639 student visas were granted to indian nationals during 2007 08 and 5 772 went on to get permanent residence visas
8835736 after having launched currency futures we need to revitalise exchange traded interest rate derivatives markets offer exchange traded credit derivatives and also need to strengthen the corporate bond markets
8835737 these three products are high on the priority list of the government and i ask the government to move forward on this
8835738 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million of them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8835739 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8835740 i picked him up and carried him back over to the median
8835741 on behalf of all the residents of westchester county we thank you from the bottom of our heart
8835742 the last time we saw him he wasnt even talking
8835743 very seldom do we have the pleasure of such a save
8835744 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner blair it is to do with the continuation of the treatment into the very important job i was doing as the coordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8835745 we have only received them in the last few hours and i consider that if these proceedings have to take place there is a proper place for conducting and airing these matters and that is within the tribunal itself
8835746 in short i think it is long past time that we all shut up stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do
8835747 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8835748 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8835749 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8835750 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8835751 robots that are better at following could be easier for people to work with a hospital robot could follow a doctor around the wards
8835752 its not only that the us administration could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side effectively armed and trained the georgian army
8835753 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states has specially created this conflict with the aim of to aggravating the situation and to benefit one of the candidates in the struggle for the post of president of the united states
8835754 draw up a strong statement reflecting our determination not to accept
8835755 it is not only a threat to international security but a breach of it
8835756 the territory previously known in soviet times as south ossetia is completely cleansed of remnants of the georgian population
8835757 an additional factor that needs to be taken into account
8835758 theres an expectation from the baltic states that the president in brussels will present a common stance of the three states the three baltic states and poland
8835759 this deployment is routine in nature and has been planned for over a year notification of the requirement to transit the turkish straits was given in june well before the current georgia crisis and is completely unrelated
8835760 its basically a greenfield project that represents a new water supply for the city
8835761 the treatment plant is just over a kilometre from shore so the water travels about two kilometres for treatment
8835762 we try to convert as much lake water into usable water as possible
8835763 the more water that is treated to drinking water standards the less water that needs to be treated as wastewater
8835764 in phase one well be treating 60 megalitres per day
8835765 the system will expand as the city requires more water
8835766 the city acquired more land central to the farming community where the sludge is eventually used for agricultural purposes
8835767 were putting in additional storage and specialized decanting cells to get better density sludge and to get more into the fields
8835768 there are many phases and considerations that must be addressed in order to successfully complete the project
8835769 for instance incorporation of the environmental components and coordinating the construction activities around these components will require careful planning
8835770 keeping an open line of communications with the public is a very important factor in the success of this project
8835771 while each structure may have its own individual challenges our teams experience on complex projects such as this and our involvement in the previous stages of the work have given us a good understanding of the projects requirements
8835772 plutonic feeling it prudent to have the best bid possible felt it would make sense to bring in a financial partner to backstop our bid to show the utility that we have the financial wherewithal to undertake the projects
8835773 plutonic enters the call with not only a solid hydro resource but with a clear financial deal that will allow it to understand in a very detailed way what it must bid to make its threshold economics
8835774 as a result their bids will be deemed much lower risk than any other potential projects by bc hydro in effect this should lead to a much lower discount rate to be applied to these projects
8835775 we think given our proximity to vancouver that we will be extremely competitive in the call for tender
8835776 some of the plant is quite old and difficult to maintain
8835777 they do preliminary treatment and disinfection but they cant treat everything if theres a heavy rain event or whatnot
8835778 were lucky in that we can pretty much build the new facility in totality while keeping the old facility running
8835779 so we really wont know until we actually tender it what the final design amount will be
8835780 everything that we have decided on in terms of unit equipment is proven in other applications
8835781 so we are not the guinea pig of any one technology but everything that were doing is of the modern design were not held back by anything
8835782 when youre drawing water from lake ontario and discharging effluent into it you are really only constrained by the size of your pumps and your pipes
8835783 in a perfect world my sense of it is that we should have an approved environmental assessment some time in 2009
8835784 after that we would proceed with detailed design and construction which could move ahead in 2010
8835785 there are two areas we need to focus on right now
8835786 the first is the head works or the primary treatment part of the process the second place where we need to make improvements is in the tertiary filters
8835787 but i throw back to you that youre not driving the same car you were in 1967 like cars equipment gets worn out and it becomes more difficult it needs to be replaced the cost of replacing it is going to be expensive thats a fact of life
8835788 we dont bury our heads in the sand when it comes to new technology if there is something new out there that has proven it can improve the longevity and performance of the facility we are certainly going to look at it
8835789 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8835790 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish
8835791 er from what i understand non executive directors cannot work for the company and the criterion is that they must contribute in some way
8835792 actually it means you must not have a stake in the company or shares in the company
8835793 bolingbrook was just a sleepy little bedroom community for chicago when i moved here
8835794 thats largely been the result of the village attracting light manufacturing distribution and office
8835795 a lot of commercial and retail businesses relocate to bolingbrook
8835796 the expansion of i 355 has made it ideal for a lot of businesses to open in the village
8835797 most of those are in farms whose owners have no interest in selling
8835798 claar is promoting a full interchange there but unless the capital bill passes in springfield that wont happen
8835799 india will play an important role in the grouping as a supplier of manpower and as a rising world power
8835800 it will send a strong signal to a lot of other people that this is not just an american vehicle india will give the grouping legitimacy
8835801 there will be a continuation of the bush policy in terms of recognising india as a nuclear power to offset chinese influence i dont see any discontinuity in it
8835802 there are common fears in the mccain and obama camps about pakistan that it is unstable and not playing the role expected of it in the war against terror
8835803 if not the security council then who the answer is the worlds democracies the united states and its democratic partners in europe and asia
8835804 as the war in kosovo showed democracies can agree and act effectively even when major non democracies such as russia and china do not because they share a common view of what constitutes a just order within states they tend to agree on when the international community has an obligation to intervene shared principles provide the foundation for legitimacy
8835805 an exclusive and aggressive formation of democratic nations very superior
8835806 it could give the united states and its allies a means to legitimise an attack on a sovereign country with or without the sanction of the un
8835807 obama is rhetorically different to bush but you would expect that in opposition in effect his policies on iran iraq and israel are almost entirely the same military action is definitely not off limits against some countries
8835808 today as we are about to enter the holy month of ramadan i urge the international community and in particular the global muslim community to exercise their moral and religious duty in support of the somali people
8835809 i saw women and children in bad conditions sometimes under the shade of a tree with no food
8835810 i am here to add my voice to the silent cry of millions of somalis
8835811 more importantly it the violence has a wider impact in terms of creating an economic crisis
8835812 we have no option but to do more and do it better
8835813 we have to invest in the security of our staff but that comes at a cost
8835814 ive seen your videos and every single dance move you use you got off of me
8835815 a warm cuddly blanket that i love to snuggle up to and cover myself with
8835816 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8835817 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8835818 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8835819 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8835820 geographically central florida is going to be the recovery point for the state of florida
8835821 in the sub market were in i see stability and i feel we are on an upward swing
8835822 the market has corrected itself from the extremes of 2005 and 2006
8835823 prices are trending down back into a more realistic range where we probably would have been if we hadnt had the big peak in 2004 and 2005
8835824 if you look at whats happened in the overall real estate market since 1995 theres been a 270 percent price appreciation from 1995 to the peak of the market in 2006
8835825 even if you go from 2003 to the peak in 2006 we had a 100 percent price appreciation
8835826 the biggest challenge in the market today is for people who purchased in 2005 and 2006
8835827 these are the folks who really got hung out at the high end of the market and if they go to sell they dont have the equity in the home because we had a price decline into a more realistic price range that segment of the market is just going to have to correct itself which will happen over time some of those homes will be foreclosed others will continue to live in their homes and it will continue to increase in value
8835828 the market continues to improve month over month in 2008
8835829 since january we kind of had the lower point in the market where our total sales were 900 homes since then our monthly sales are increasing and now were upwards of 1 400 to 1 500 sales per month we keep seeing strong sales activity and were seeing more traffic were seeing the fence sitters coming back into the market
8835830 even when the market slows down peoples desire to purchase a new home doesnt go away theyre just postponing their decision because they dont have confidence in the market yet
8835831 we feel that the market will continue to improve and 2009 is when i really think well begin seeing strong movement of activity coming in i see it as being a steady increase
8835832 younger patients are trying to fit in and appear more like their peers while older adults are trying to improve things enhance them or make them appear different
8835833 can be transformational in terms of their attitude and mood and how they feel about themselves

8835838 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish
8835839 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush estuvo en lo cierto el 90 de las veces
8835840 y en su nombre pienso ganar estas elecciones y mantener la promesa estadounidense viva
8835841 cambio significa un sistema tributario que no premia a los grupos de presi n que lo redactaron sino a los trabajadores estadounidenses y a los peque os negocios que lo merecen
8835842 especially this year a growing number of factors make for an uncertain income outlook for farmers
8835843 it will be rather difficult to achieve speedy growth in farm incomes
8835844 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8835845 our fundamental task remains to secure long term debt restructuring and we will continue to work with our lending groups to achieve this goal
8835846 we want to fix the shortage instead of creating a situation where hospitals have to shift the nursing workload to lesser trained workers
8835847 its not un doable but its very hard its not something thats going to be taken care of right away
8835848 thousands of qualified students are turned away from nursing programs each year as a result of insufficient faculty
8835849 i think there is a sense on the commission that public parks should be free to citizens
8835850 but there is a need to balance that sentiment with overcrowding and the impacts of high usage and the need for extra revenues to keep up with maintenance
8835851 but the reality is that there just isnt enough money for all the needs for all city parks
8835852 i think we need to make sure we can take care of marina park first
8835853 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8835854 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8835855 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8835856 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8835857 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8835858 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8835859 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8835860 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8835861 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8835862 mit weiterhin deutlichen pr mienzuw chsen von ber 10 und abermals gesenkten kosten und leistungsquoten haben wir uns auf der versicherungstechnischen seite wiederum deutlich verbessert die combined ratio in der schaden und unfallversicherung wurde um mehr als acht prozentpunkte auf 90 0 reduziert auf der anderen seite haben die fallenden aktienm rkte und der zinsanstieg auch in den ersten sechs monaten des laufenden jahres zu einem geringeren finanzergebnis gef hrt in summe ergeben verbesserte versicherungstechnik und geringere kapitalertr ge im ersten halbjahr 2008 ein um 18 5 reduziertes ergebnis von 110 mio euro 1 6 2007 135 mio euro f r das gesamtjahr 2008 erwarten wir bei einer stabilisierung der kapitalm rkte und keinen au ergew hnlichen negativen belastungen der versicherungstechnik ein ergebnis in der bandbreite von 230 bis 250 mio euro trotz der belastungen durch die kapitalm rkte streben wir damit f r heuer ein ergebnis an dass im bereich des um die strabag effekte bereinigten ergebnisses des jahres 2007 landet das vorjahresergebnis in der h he von 340 mio euro hat ja rund 110 mio euro an einmaleffekten aus dem strabag deal enthalten das erfreuliche wachstum und die positive entwicklung der versicherungstechnik erlaubt es auch unter der annahme einer sich gegen ber 2007 08 verbessernden kapitalmarktsituation an unserer mittelfristigen ergebnisplanung f r 2010 von 430 mio euro festzuhalten

8835878 judged on community benefits environmental impact and cost rehabilitation and refurbishment is clearly the way forward
8835879 it is less destructive helps preserve the existing community saves money and offers revitalisation without losing the enduring qualities of these characterful and much loved terraced streets
8835880 with good imaginative design these houses can be easily adapted to offer the variety of housing which the pathfinder agencies say is required for the area
8835881 shown that by extending the houses in various ways and creating new private or shared space around them you can create a wide variety of different accommodation
8835882 i think its vital as a concept that they will retain the things which already exist and enhance them
8835883 so the houses will become much more attractive than they already are
8835884 our plans for the regeneration of the toxteth street area in openshaw have been drawn up following consultation with local residents
8835885 these plans will transform an area of poor quality housing a poor environment and significant crime and anti social behaviour into a sustainable family focused residential area where once again existing residents will choose to stay and new families will choose to come to live providing significant long term benefit to the wider openshaw area

8835896 our cloud based delivery model offers our customers rapid deployment and compelling economics
8835897 the potential downside is that cisco isnt known as a software company and completing the technology integration might be challenging for them
8835898 the on premises market is quite competitive and exchange is well entrenched which is why cisco may want to offer it only as a service
8835899 it is the only exchange alternative that does not require a plug in to work with outlook and its admin and licensing costs tend to be lower than for exchange

8836015 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8836016 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything
8836017 freezers tend to be countercyclical meaning that they generally do better when the economy is soft because people go out less and buy groceries in bulk
8836018 recessionary range held down by concerns about rising unemployment declining real wages falling home prices and tightening credit conditions
8836019 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8836020 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8836021 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8836022 in the aftermath of the break down of negotiations becker made it clear that it intended to move aggressively to undermine quintiles business

8836057 what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time

8836061 the transport system is just bad the service is poor basic infrastructures and user safety are lacking
8836062 the government is not paying attention to the smaller towns the bus operators there are crying out for help but its falling on deaf ears
8836063 many small bus operators outside the klang valley are forced to shut down because of spiralling oil prices and operational costs
8836064 right now we have two or three operators servicing one route it is a waste of resources and a recipe for disaster
8836065 what is needed is better organisation instead of getting new operators we should revitalise the old ones as they have a wealth of experience
8836066 this body should be focused on the planning regulation and to oversee public transport nationwide
8836067 it costs more than rm3 000 to install the ngv kit
8836068 perhaps the government can bear the fixed costs such as building infrastructure and buying new buses and trains but the operational costs should be borne by the operators themselves
8836069 there should be stewardship policies on public transportation are always changing its a political toy to gain grassroots support this must change
8836070 its a challenging time as the government must look into the bigger picture of taking care of the economy while their political standing is weakening
8836071 the government must not be afraid sometimes we need to swallow the bitter pill if we delay doing so repercussions will be on the economy
8836072 the policies must be consistent and pro business in the long run im sure the rakyat will understand
8836073 inflation rate is a real killer the purchasing power is low and there is a need to review salary adjustments based on the current situation
8836074 things are expensive now if there are no pay adjustments many would find it difficult to cope with the rising cost of living
8836075 provide subsidies to the right group of people especially low income earners this is not subsidy mentality but simply a matter of sharing resources
8836076 the authorities should control the prices of goods from escalating and provide incentives in the form of bonuses or salary adjustments for civil servants to ease their burden
8836077 such a scheme would ensure that only the deserving receives subsidies
8836078 there should be stewardship policies on public transportation are always changing its a political toy to gain grassroots support this must change

8836091 with all this god given heritage at our disposal there is no reason why sabah should not be able to produce great batik
8836092 we have so many ethnic tribes with all kinds of indigenous motifs and patterns and our flora and fauna is second to none
8836093 we also have world class artists among us but yet our batik industry is lagging so far behind our western counterparts
8836094 we hope that the competition will inspire batik painters to take their business seriously and realise the potential for intricate and unique high quality batik
8836095 we have many talented people but they are not bothered with turning their simple products into lucrative businesses which can fetch 10 times more in value in the market
8836096 some people are satisfied with selling cheap quality batik which is not even from sabah and dare not venture into bigger markets
8836097 many people are willing to spend a lot of money to buy good quality batik from a famous painter and commissions from corporations and conferences are also a major market

8836106 its a different aspect of the game that im not very familiar with but i kind of like it
8836107 theres not a lot of rules and a lot of thinking its about going out there and being a football player and playing
8836108 you have to figure which guys are going to make it does someone else come in from the outside to make it
8836109 also which guys will be on the practice squad so those guys will get a lot of opportunities in tonights game
8836110 its almost like what have you done for me lately

8836118 all i did was make pitches and throw ground balls and the guys behind me theyre the ones that made the plays all it takes is one error for a run to come in and they didnt make one
8836119 its a different feeling sitting there thinking youre one pitch away from two outs
8836120 how much hes had to endure everybody pulls for guys like that
8836121 i feel i can stretch the field with my speed and being able to catch the ball
8836122 i can only do so much in the end its a business decision
8836123 they blocked 15 shots and disrupted a lot of others
8836124 we finally got back into sync down the stretch when we kind of found our rhythm but l a is a very good team
8836125 for us we rely on our defense to fuel our offense
8836126 but we didnt do a good job in the second and third quarters of defending them that forced us to play their half court game we had to find ways to manufacture shots
8836127 ive played against them a lot more than i played with them we said hello before the game but then it was back to sacramento l a just like always
8836128 she really hasnt played much in two years but shes been improving significantly every day shes going to help us

8836134 what you did how our relationship was you messed up you cant call me for stuff you cant ask me for anything you didnt take care of me and my sister my mom did i had to get over that
8836135 i only got to know my dad a few years ago and now hes sick i cant get away from that i cant i just have to be back there for him as much as i can
8836136 i dont go home but i have tremendous support from all the teachers staff and a personal secretary who keeps me focused on the task at hand i can say we feel a little bit spoiled now god has blessed us this year
8836137 he was a hard worker and a good intelligent kid

8836154 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8836155 im blissfully unaware of that kind of stuff which i guess is probably a good thing i work a lot and im pretty engrossed in the stories that im covering and the work that i do and thats the things i try to follow

8836169 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8836170 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
8836171 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8836172 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
8836173 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8836174 the number speaks for itself indian students have a high visa compliance rate and they are a very important part of the australias 12 5 billion us 11 billion education export industry
8836175 as many as 47 639 student visas were granted to indian nationals during 2007 08 and 5 772 went on to get permanent residence visas

8836178 level 2 teacher training ill be offline the entire time will post an update when i return in 10 days
8836179 my 11 year old son will not take responsibility for anything he does he can drop something right in front of me or forget part of his baseball uniform and yet it is never his fault his younger sister is following in the same pattern what can i do to change his attitude
8836180 there is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in vietnam and the struggle i and others have been waging in america
8836181 there is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection
8836182 our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty racism and militarism with this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores a genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies this call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond ones tribe race class and nation is in reality a call for an all embracing and unconditional love for all mankind
8836183 last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8836184 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8836185 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you its about you
8836186 what happens from here on in wont matter i just had to be here
8836187 obama represents a down payment on the fulfillment of martins dream
8836188 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8836189 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8836190 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8836191 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8836192 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8836193 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8836194 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8836195 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8836196 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8836197 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8836198 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8836199 but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8836200 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8836201 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8836202 fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8836203 now the beauty of it is coming out this is what the founding fathers wanted to come about
8836204 since she didnt win my second vote is for obama
8836205 we all have dreams i wanted to be here to join in its about unity
8836206 theres a lot of excitement throughout pennsylvania about this campaign our supporters are excited that barack obama is finally officially our nominee for president they want to get together to celebrate this
8836207 the supporters across the state did say lets get together there are more than 200 locations across the state ranging from a few people in somebodys home to lots of students on a college campus somewhere its definitely a historic speech
8836208 i think its everyones obligation to make the effort to come out
8836209 these are the worst conditions that the country has seen for a long time and together we can make it different
8836210 said leslie pierce and catching her husbands eye began to laugh as he chimed in
8836211 they taught me how to carry myself the value of a firm handshake how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them
8836212 we had a roof over our head we each had a bed and we had clothes to wear to church every sunday
8836213 i remember white people standing on the corners spitting and foaming at the mouth
8836214 but most things that influenced you as a child you carry through life
8836215 we had just brought in groceries from the pantry pride on stenton avenue my mother was putting the bags on the counter when i heard the news
8836216 and i remember the skies lighting up on columbia avenue during the riots
8836217 and the day after he was shot i huddled in a corner at school i was afraid that something might happen to us
8836218 every single day ive always had to work at this level
8836219 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8836220 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8836221 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8836222 so whats it like to grow up with a korean mom and a white dad
8836223 the plight of those poor little yet so dang adorable oriental halfies so cute but so bad
8836224 we may be sued by malaysia before the international court of justice
8836225 it was not intended to be governed by international law
8836226 the government would have been obligated to amend the constitution regardless of whether congress refuses to initiate it or if it is not ratified by the people
8836227 under international law we must comply with our international obligations
8836228 we cannot raise as defense our internal law or the constitution
8836229 you are risking dismemberment of the country in your conjecture
8836230 the moa may have been set aside but not the peace process
8836231 i have a wife who genuinely loves to fish i mean she will take the lead and ask me to go out fishing
8836232 she loves football shell go to hockey games and i jokingly say now if i could only get her to have sex with me
8836233 why the heck did i do that and that and that oh now why did i do that
8836234 why did i not draft a young running back with upside in the late rounds
8836235 i felt like i was going to play about a half and it was the last game it was new years eve there were so many other factors that brought my focus away from what is actually important
8836236 and thats something that i am never going to do again
8836237 there is too much i am responsible for to not give it 100 percent during the week and just the full attention
8836238 i left a lot on the field last year i watched the film from last year and saw things that i can do better i probably could have caught 100 balls touchdowns i only had five so i can get a lot better in each category
8836239 hes all business and hes running all kinds of routes hes running inside routes outside routes and showing very good stamina ill be honest with you weve missed him
8836240 hes one of the most gifted running backs ive been around for a long time
8836241 he is very similar to terrell davis when he came in
8836242 they then told him that the dog had not been trained yet
8836243 lieutenant england then told him that the dog would not bite him and that she would prove it to him
8836244 in contempt of our policies which are intended to promote a value for diversity within our organization and support positive relationships within the community we serve
8836245 the standard caricature youd see from the old days 50 60 70 years ago black face buckteeth bug eyes holding a watermelon
8836246 it brought back memories of my childhood in ohio ed i dont recall ohio being a hotbed of klan activity where the klan still marched when racism was overt all the name calling i and my family had to endure
8836247 those kinds of characters were very common and id like to see some sensitivity on the part of the county administration to do something about it
8836248 they dont want to offend anybody and will modify the exhibit
8836249 harken back for many people particularly the older generation to the period when there were only derogatory images of african americans
8836250 ceramic uncles and celluloid mammies black images and their influence on culture

8836253 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8836254 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8836255 our company has been caught between investor flight caused by the collapse of finance companies and other investment funds and the bottom dropping out of the property development market

8836258 i currently prefer fusion for its low impact on other os x applications support for multiple virtual cpus and huge library of virtual appliances
8836259 i have reason to believe fusion has better program support in general
8836260 if we were not allowed to telecast the news and current affairs programmes we will suspend our entire network indefinitely
8836261 the troops open fire on peaceful demonstrators voicing for their right of self determination which is a shame for india state
8836262 we are addressing this appeal on the behalf of people of jammu and kashmir who remain in a state of siege at the hands of massive military might of india this punishment has been awarded by the indian authorities to the people of jammu and kashmir for using their democratic right to dissent

8836264 man i hope they write me a check for that idea
8836265 the mobile sector is at a point of change we need regulation to adapt
8836266 the catalyst will be twofold one would be opportunistic and m amp a driven funding by investment grade companies the other would be un rated companies that have little other alternatives
8836267 the singapore i like to see when i grow up
8836268 im getting an mri just to make sure ive got a good game plan about whats going on
8836269 it gets better every day but i cant get over that hump
8836270 im hoping ill wake up one day and its fine hopefully its soon i just want to check it out make sure everythings ok its more a precautionary thing than anything
8836271 i think that they certainly want to see him in person its all set up where that can be done if they feel like it will help
8836272 i actually thought the ball he hit off of mo was out when he hit it
8836273 from where im sitting he got the good part of it just dropped his hands a little bit i thought it had a chance to go into the seats a guy like that though were not going to make or break our assessment on him in four at bats with the red sox guys been a good player for a long time hes going to help us win some games
8836274 the one thing with an oblique is you have to go slow because if you go too fast the day you go too fast you start all over
8836275 its not up to us to get a replay but im assuming if you scream loud enough
8836276 theyre not obligated because you go out there and yell i think were all probably going to feel our way through this a little bit if you think theyre wrong or you think theres a chance youre going to go out and either ask or yell depending on your mood now theres some ability to go check
8836277 this one hurts ill sit here and finish the questions and then well move on like we always do we played our hearts out we just lost a really tough game
8836278 if lester makes a mistake where hes at in that game i have a hard time living with myself
8836279 we brought in oki in case they wanted to hit and the worst thing happened its hard to take he threw the first pitch i think right where he wanted it i actually thought the popup was in fair territory and it blew out tried to get a fastball down and he left it belt high and he crushed it its certainly not what were looking for
8836280 whether it really was i dont know it was close but i should have made that last pitch anyway to get the ground ball
8836281 he threw two borderline pitches that could have been strike three and those are game changers unfortunately we didnt get the calls right there they were borderline they werent no brainer calls thats sometimes the difference in games
8836282 maybe if you have a very very very slow runner then you might have a milli chance
8836283 his fastball was explosive he threw all his pitches he was tremendous its a shame the way the game ended
8836284 oh yeah i forgot to tell you we had a little fender bender when we went for pizza last night
8836285 we need for other guys to step up and pitch in
8836286 i think scary is probably a good word for it ive had some sleepless nights thinking about all kinds of stuff you generally think the worst
8836287 we dont feel comfortable pitching him unless he is 100 percent
8836288 obviously you dont want to go back out there and pitch two innings and give up seven runs
8836289 like i said in toronto its just one of those deals where we had to move forward forget about it and go get em in five days i did that today and found the strike zone and felt pretty good
8836290 his fastball was explosive he threw all his pitches he was tremendous its a shame the way the game ended
8836291 i felt pretty good and felt like i had some pretty good stuff early on
8836292 i got into some jams and got out of some jams but obviously its not the outcome that youd want but we had a good road trip and hopefully we can carry the momentum back home
8836293 obviously its tough on the team hes one of our horses and a guy we count on for a lot of innings but hes got to take care of his body
8836294 if his body is telling him i cant pitch then he cant pitch were going to do our best to pick up his slack
8836295 i felt all right i didnt feel any better or worse than the start of the game
8836296 its my mind set to keep making pitches until i get out of it
8836297 ransom had a good at bat there he battled laid off some good pitches also fouled off some good pitches and hits a double down the line
8836298 but its still just not quite 100 percent we dont feel comfortable pitching him unless he is 100 percent because we have to take his long term interests and the teams long term interests into account first and foremost so again mainly for his peace of mind as much as anything else hes going to go see dr andrews on friday
8836299 we dont want to put any pitcher in a position where he has to take the mound at anything less than 100 percent
8836300 so we think this is the right move we had him penciled in i think you could tell from our answers to you guys the last couple of days we thought this might be a possibility its the right thing to do
8836301 i think scary is probably a good word for it ive had some sleepless nights thinking about all kinds of stuff you generally think the worst
8836302 were always concerned for all of our pitchers when theyre less than 100 percent but were pretty optimistic this things getting better
8836303 it just makes sense josh has a great relationship with andrews hes an accomplished doctor get another opinion here hope he comes back and can take the ball pretty soon
8836304 were trying to figure out whats causing it and go from there
8836305 right now its just day to day and im dealing with it we have a great medical staff were trying to be cautious were not talking about just the end of a season but about the end of a career some organizations would do anything they could to get a player back out there i appreciate what they are doing for me here
8836306 hes one of our horses and a guy that we count on for a lot of innings but hes got to take care of his body if his bodys telling him i cant pitch then he cant pitch were going to do our best to pick up his slack
8836307 political videos parodies and satires are part of contemporary culture
8836308 scurrilous and false allegations that undermine respect for the government

8836310 this is one more symptom of the damage being inflicted by soaring fuel prices which is why the uk government must use its own energy tax windfall to help the economy
8836311 well have to watch the tape and evaluate it and see what in the world happened with tommy
8836312 i know this he threw the ball better in practice than he did out there
8836313 efter flera r i bland annat wien och stuttgart har jag sett och upplevt m nga halvtokiga regiss rer och dirigenter men alla har haft respekt f r s ngarens kapacitet och kunskap att ta ansvar i sin yrkesroll
8836314 even my mom says it all the time still hows your shoulder
8836315 itll feel good to worry about something else worry about an opponent or stuff thats going on on the game field and not have to worry about my shoulder thats going to feel good
8836316 last year it helped us a lot seeing we can compete with some of the top teams in the country it opened everybodys eyes to realize we can do something special here
8836317 i wouldnt like to see him get hit but itll happen
8836318 thats just football i know t j s tough i know hes a tough individual hell get right back up
8836319 forty seconds goes by a lot faster up there than it does for a fan on the sideline
8836320 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
8836321 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
8836322 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
8836323 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
8836324 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
8836325 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for he added
8836326 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted
8836327 im just going to try to score because i know those guys dont want to run
8836328 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8836329 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk

8836368 broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8836369 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8836370 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8836371 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8836372 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8836373 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8836374 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8836375 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8836376 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8836377 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8836378 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8836379 ik vertel de waarheid maar die schiet bij sommige mensen in het verkeerde keelgat zo vind ik al die halfslachtige mantypes zoals nu de metro man bijvoorbeeld gecastreerde sukkels ik word hartstikke krankjorum van dat geneuzel in die damesbladen de metro man is een uitvinding van de cosmetica industrie die er alles aan doet om de man aan de cr mes en zalfjes te krijgen waarom moeten mannen anders plots hun geslachtsdelen kaalscheren of zich van hun vrouwelijke kant tonen ik merk dat mannen tegenwoordig niet meer weten hoe ze zich als man moeten gedragen daarom heb ik dit boek geschreven
8836380 het is een internethype geworden ik denk dat ik een snaar heb geraakt de laatste vijftig jaar stond in het teken van de vrouwelijke emancipatie en dat was een goede zaak maar nu is het tijd om de man te remanciperen

8836392 este momento estas elecciones son nuestra oportunidad para mantener en el siglo xxi la promesa americana con vida
8836393 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8836394 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8836395 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8836396 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8836397 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8836398 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur
8836399 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8836400 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa
8836401 terminar la lucha contra al qaeda y los talib n en afganist n
8836402 no se que tipo de vidas cree john mccain que tienen las celebridades pero esa ha sido la m a
8836403 esos son mis h roes sus abuelos esas son las historias que me formaron y por ellos pretendo ganar estas elecciones
8836404 si hubi semos querido fichar a cazorla le habr amos tra do
8836405 we believe there are too many uncertainties to be aggressive one way or the other we are maintaining our hold rating
8836406 house prices are unlikely to continue rising at current rates
8836407 a moderate cooling in the housing market should one occur would not be inconsistent with the economy continuing to grow at or near its potential next year
8836408 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
8836409 and he insists strongly that they should be accorded the respect they deserve if any team brings this determination and this will to succeed with them then they have a chance of progressing if you do have that kind of desire theres a chance that it will happen
8836410 you dont arrive in the last four of the all ireland series by mistake or some freak
8836411 you have to be there on merit so everybody in the last four is there on merit and each of them deserve the same respect thats the way it is
8836412 they have shown themselves to be a very hard working composed team with a lot of skill and experience
8836413 they will have taken a great deal from their wins over down and armagh and will certainly relish the challenge of facing us
8836414 for a county like wexford who people would say have no chance of winning an all ireland final the feeling is that it is even harder for us to bounce back following the leinster final defeat which we suffered
8836415 there are so many traditional counties out of the competition and we are still there all we have done is stick to our jobs and see what comes out
8836416 tyrone were certainly very good against dublin they were very efficient but the team in 2005 was a very young team so it doesnt surprise me to see a lot of those players still performing so well
8836417 we have been making things hard for ourselves lets be honest about that
8836418 we have not been as creative as we can be and we have been missing chances
8836419 meath are always hard to beat no matter at what level you meet them
8836420 we might have played well in passages of our matches but we need to maintain our form at this level it will be very demanding
8836421 no matter whether it was a party house the rule of law must apply
8836422 women are there to be used by you for your own pleasure
8836423 is the stuff of nightmares for a woman living on her own to wake up in her own bed and to find that bed occupied by a man intent on sexual gratification no matter what your wishes
8836424 i think its brilliant what he has got and although it will not change what happened its a bit of justice i just hope more girls will will be able to come forward stand up and go through it at least i have got this far and stood up to him
8836425 the human mind has its limitations cannot therefore fully understand a god who is a spirit
8836426 weve already started rehearsals and so far ive danced about six hours
8836427 matthew is absolutely gorgeous in every way and is such a wonderful dancer of course the pressure is on given that he won with alesha last year and she was fabulous but i will try my best not to embarrass myself or screw up i dont want to let matthew down
8836428 ill be up against people with different levels of experience in dancing and who will have more time on their hands to rehearse but im not going to think about the other contestants im just going to focus on my own performance
8836429 yes its going to be a crazy time for me but im just so excited about the prospect of being able to dance at the end of it all
8836430 ive never danced before im not a performer and have no stage school background
8836431 ive always been a fan of the show but wouldnt know the difference between the foxtrot or the salsa but im going to give it my best and enjoy it while i try its going to be amazing
8836432 wexford have shown themselves to be a very resilient team they will feel they can raise their game further and obviously we have to be ready for the challenge
8836433 from the minute the whistle went in our game against the dubs our thoughts have been on wexford we are certainly looking no further than this sunday it would foolish to so otherwise
8836434 it is a joint office this is not worth the paper its written on
8836435 the dup are in complete disarray and have just not thought this through
8836436 no letter from a first minister without being co signed by the deputy first minister can carry the imprimatur of the office
8836437 in fact it has no authority at all it just shows which party is up for attempting to resolve these issues and which is not
8836438 there is no doubt that the award had a major positive impact on raising awareness of pips and the work we do here
8836439 immediately after the ceremony we had a number of individuals who contacted us after reading about the woman of the year award wanting to make donations
8836440 it has been wonderful for the charity and personally it was a lovely experience and a fantastic night at the awards ceremony
8836441 you do this work because you are passionate about it and not because you expect any recognition and to be nominated and receive an award was super i was really choked up on the night
8836442 when we launched the competition last year we were hopeful of a good response and our readers really did embrace the whole essence of what our woman of the year awards is about
8836443 the huge number of nominations we received proved just how many very special and inspirational women there are in northern ireland
8836444 we look forward to this years competition and the amazing stories that will unfold as nominations start to come in
8836445 seeing the story about jade goody in the headlines has brought it all back to me i do feel sympathy for her and i just want to tell her itll be all right i was told i had cervical cancer on june 9 i think in the afternoon i was 26 nearly 27 at the time and didnt know what was coming it was at the doctors surgery in south tyrone id been to have minor surgery they scraped away some of the cells of the cervix after id had a few smear tests then i got a letter telling me to come back and get the results dr sidhu told me the news and i just went into shock i went home and told my husband clayton then i phoned my mum there were a few tears yes i didnt know what to think clayton and i had only been married in april and one of my first thoughts was am i going to be able to have children thats the difference between my situation then and jade goodys now shes already got children which is definitely a plus for her so one of my first questions to dr sidhu was can i have children she had already spoken to consultant dr john price of the city hospital about my case and because i was young they thought i could have this new operation the trachelectomy where two thirds of the uterus is preserved and tissue repairs are made i saw dr price a few weeks later and had the operation on september 1 it was all pretty quick i was nervous as i wasnt sure what was going to happen they didnt know if the cancer had spread then when they found out it hadnt and i could try for children i was over the moon but of course there were still no guarantees wed have kids clayton and i kind of didnt talk about it we just got on with things and thought whatever happened would happen when i became pregnant it was marvellous and scary at the same time scary because id been told there was a greater chance of miscarriage so for the first few months i was very careful and kind of walked on eggshells i still feel emilys a miracle you kind of think shes mine and i cant believe it shes a very lively little girl now were adding to our family im going into hospital on september 10 to have the baby its amazing id hoped id have more children but after emily we thought wed see what happened ive had very good medical treatment and look after my health a bit more now i go for check ups every six months if i hadnt had the smear test and had got pregnant without knowing i had cancer then it could have spread through my body and i might not be here today
8836446 it happened just before christmas last year i felt really fine and now i understand why cervical cancer is called the silent killer i had no sickness no tiredness nothing at all my smear results had been coming back slightly abnormal since i had my wee boy in december 2004 then in august 2006 i went for another smear test and it showed further abnormalities so they suggested i have the cells lasered off that scared me so i went to see a doctor privately and she said there was nothing to be worried about but that i should not have the procedure if i wanted another child there was no urgency at that stage last summer i went to her for a check up and she said that things had got slightly worse and that i should definitely have the cells removed that happened on december 5 last year everything went well and she said she would see me in six months time but on december 12 its a date i will never forget i got the phone call to come and see her immediately i was going down the motorway to work but phoned my husband alastair and turned around to wait for him at craigavon and we went into the hospital together words cannot describe what it was like its unbelievable when you get a cancer diagnosis id always thought it cant be me its always someone else plus i felt totally well the news was that my cancer had been there for a while but was slow progressing i was told on the wednesday and on the friday i went for an mri scan i saw the consultant the following week who said that the best solution was a radical hysterectomy i thought it was a small price to pay for me to be around for my family my son jonathans only three and a half from the day i heard the diagnosis to the operation was only three or four weeks which was fantastic the worst thing is the waiting people said christmas was a terrible time for it to happen but i had a christmas party to plan for my son who was born on december 27 so i kept busy we even had a santa i went to the ulster clinic which was fine then had to wait a long week for what theyd removed to be analysed that was dreadful fortunately it turned out no further treatment was required the jade goody news has reminded me of my illness but its always in my head anyway i think well arent i lucky since having the smear test really saved my life this year to try and give something back i did the race for life with my sister and a friend and i managed to raise 12 500
8836447 im very very sad but it is by mutual agreement
8836448 rose has been with bbc northern ireland presenting across radio and television for over 20 years
8836449 she is moving on to pursue other projects and we wish her every success for the future
8836450 nigeria zal nooit een overeenkomst met iran aangaan die te maken heeft met wapens
8836451 ze moet niet de rol van harde tante van vlaanderen spelen
8836452 ik ben heel gematigd ik weet dat belgi niet alle miserie van de wereld kan opvangen maar met meer menselijkheid en verstand kan men zeker een oplossing vinden ik heb het akkoord over asiel mee onderhandeld minister turtelboom moet dat respecteren
8836453 this election has never been about me its about you
8836454 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8836455 el ice est avanzando en llevar a cabo la remoci n del se or posada de los ee uu
8836456 un juez de inmigraci n suspendi la deportaci n a cuba y venezuela sin embargo eso no impide al ice deportarlo hacia un tercer pa s el ice est en proceso de conducir una revisi n rutinaria de su custodia
8836457 vino el embajador charles ford a pedirme a m a trav s de la canciller a que le diera una visa a posada carriles
8836458 era imposible darle una visa a luis posada carriles cuando era una persona cuestionada por actos de terrorismo ellos defienden ese tipo de terrorismo me consta a m y por ese tipo de cosas es que tenemos posiciones diferentes
8836459 habr alg n hondure o que no sepa que aqu la embajada de ee uu toda la vida ha interferido en golpes de estado promovido en toda am rica latina invasiones a otros pa ses ha promovido guerras en otros pa ses
8836460 no fuimos v ctimas de la guerra fr a en poca de los 80 cuando desde aqu se atacaba a nicaragua con la contrarrevoluci n nicarag ense y honduras era prestado como un territorio para acciones b licas
8836461 us still working on revised draft and india still demanding
8836462 as aca had predicted but to the apparent surprise of the indian and us governments more than 20 states essentially said no thanks and proposed more than 50 amendments and modifications that would establish some basic but vitally important restrictions and conditions on nuclear trade with india
8836463 many of these amendments track with the restrictions and conditions established in 2006 us legislation regulating us nuclear trade with india which include the termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing a ban on the transfer of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology a requirement for permanent and unconditional facility specific safeguards and a review mechanism
8836464 it is vital that these and other states stand their ground
8836465 there are signs however that the process of developing a revised draft is taking so long that the other 44 members will not have sufficient time to analyse the proposal and work through their respective national political processes to enable them to take a decision by next week
8836466 it not appealing does create an impression that by virtue of the present position of lalu prasad in the central government the cbi has chosen not to file the appeal on extraneous consideration
8836467 the cbi has chosen to oppose the government appeal under extraneous circumstances otherwise an agency which investigated the offence found prima facie material for submission of chargesheet and conducted the prosecution is not expected to take a complete u turn and question the bonafide of its appeal which if allowed would stand to establish the credibility of the cbi
8836468 today i felt nervous at the beginning and then it went away
8836469 i am not thinking about anything right now just enjoying the moment
8836470 this is very disappointing to me but something i have to accept
8836471 i never saw her coin play before so i didnt know what to expect
8836472 she played a lot better than i expected she served very well
8836473 i kept thinking play your game and get your first serve in
8836474 it will be like playing a no 1 because she used to be no 1
8836475 demanded that the press not overly quip or sneer at the chinese mens soccer team
8836476 so how does it feel being a resident of this country now
8836477 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8836478 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight on november 4 we must stand up and say eight is enough
8836479 bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8836480 i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8836481 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8836482 in the hopes and dreams the competence and courage the rightness and readiness of barack obama
8836483 weve come a long way but we still have a distance to go
8836484 but we must march again we must march like we have never marched before to elect the next president of the united states barack obama
8836485 we would not be denying the climate crisis we would be solving the climate crisis
8836486 importante o torcedor sentir o prazer de jogar em casa
8836487 existe a id ia de colocar vans para levar os torcedores das esta es de metr para o est dio
8836488 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8836489 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8836490 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8836491 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8836492 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8836493 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8836494 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8836495 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8836496 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8836497 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8836498 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8836499 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8836500 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8836501 ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8836502 a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8836503 its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8836504 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8836505 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
8836506 so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8836507 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag
8836508 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8836509 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8836510 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
8836511 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8836512 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
8836513 passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers
8836514 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8836515 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8836516 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8836517 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8836518 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
8836519 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8836520 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8836521 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8836522 ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow
8836523 a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8836524 hes really clever because every interview ive done in the last week has mentioned oasis
8836525 so im answering questions about their new record and he ends up in everybodys interviews he is a publicity machine
8836526 it just goes to show you how people will lie
8836527 rubbish rumours of renewing wedding vows i think once was enough and ive just paid out on a big party for her birthday
8836528 i bought her two original hermes drawings of equestrian thingies sic but trust me the party was infinitely more expensive than the paintings
8836529 you will hear it all i have 101 text messages between lindsay and i and i have about 60 tape recordings of dina these lies have to stop she cant say all these things to me and when i try to address it deny everything dinas a hypocrite and im tired of it
8836530 first we thought someone is bursting crackers and so we ran towards the main gate then we saw and heard people screaming and running there was blood all over the place swamiji and mataji and others were lying in blood i shouted and ran away we all started running here and there
8836531 swamiji ran into the toilet to save himself and shut the door mataji who hid behind the door was shot first the miscreants then broke open the toilet door and sprayed bullets
8836532 i rushed towards the main gate along with others only to see some men running around and loud cracking noise i heard the cries of swamiji and others i saw other swamijis running here and there i was scared and ran inside the hostel room with another girl we sat huddled together until after a long time one of the swamijis came and escorted us out of the room
8836533 i too rushed out after hearing the noise i saw bodies lying in blood i touched swamijis feet who was lying in the bathroom it was still warm but he did not move nor did mataji who lay inside the room
8836534 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8836535 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8836536 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8836537 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8836538 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8836539 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8836540 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8836541 it continues to be an extraordinarily complex problem we need to continue to press on it there are areas there are areas that we can do better there are areas that the pakistan military can do better we understand that its an area i think we can all improves on but it isnt it is not going to be something that gets solved overnight
8836542 there is a significant amount of political churn in pakistan that hes general kiyani very much aware of
8836543 as ive come to know him hes been very clear to me and not just in saying it but what his actions are that his goal my view is to do the right thing hes an extraordinary individual and his ultimate his goals are his principles and goals are to do whats best for pakistan and everything hes done our engagement indicates thats absolutely the case
8836544 he kayani knows his country a whole lot better than we do theyre an important ally in that part of the world and a very very critical and increasingly unstable part of the world
8836545 surgeries and consultations would have been booked months before if patients cannot reach the hospital they miss treatment at the correct time cancer patients are the worst hit even chemotherapies have had to be postponed due to hartals on a hartal day we have send ambulances to bring doctors hoping that ambulances will be spared by the agitators the entire logistics of the hospital goes haywire

8836547 in america these things happen you have a different system in germany if you lose an arm its not worth a million dollars
8836548 he had some clear ideas on how he wanted the products to look and he even designed the logo which resembles a crown
8836549 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
8836550 domestic violence affects women who are famous who are not famous women who have money women who have no money this is an issue that crosses all boundaries and it certainly affects everyone
8836551 shes made her mark with her career shes super talented shes an entertainer
8836552 im not sure if she will win i dont even know if it really matters whether she wins or not
8836553 once the season starts its a whole new ballgame we know that
8836554 what counts is how you play in the regular season thats what matters it doesnt mean that the individual performances and group performances and how you execute plays isnt important it is important and that leads to your execution at a later point in time but id say thats what you gain from preseason
8836555 we had our problems but preseason is behind us now were moving forward to kc
8836556 aunque s lo son descritas dos teclas es de notar que dos teclas no es una limitaci n y que m s de dos teclas pueden ser usadas para producir una o m s se ales de control
8836557 por ejemplo durante la operaci n de un programa de m sica la rueda de desplazamiento podr a aparecer cuando se usan dos dedos para navegar verticalmente en lugar de uno solo
8836558 en algunos casos la rueda de desplazamiento aparece solo cuando dos dedos se ponen en un rea predeterminada del interfaz
8836559 es de notar que aunque la se muestra una rueda de desplazamiento de superficie los mismo principios pueden ser aplicados a otros rueda de desplazamientos convencionales

8836629 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
8836630 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
8836631 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
8836632 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
8836633 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
8836634 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
8836635 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8836636 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8836637 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8836638 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8836639 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8836640 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8836641 god i miss you so much i missed you so so much
8836642 the system at work in the mice and other organisms is evolutionarily very old so i suspect that what works in mice will work in humans

8836645 my grandmother is the black sheep rebel of the family
8836646 she gave birth to my dad at age 15 in 1939 imagine the scandal then and has lived with natives in new guinea and eaten human flesh among other things she once got in trouble with the police for being the first person to wear a bikini on a sydney beach shes a 60s bohemian who helped raise me and taught me how to think differently and to question dogma
8836647 never in my wildest dreams did i think we would find an activator of sir2
8836648 thats why i dont think there is anything more important than this quest thats why i take chances and why the controversy is worth it because i think we are right
8836649 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8836650 im single and i had a long term girlfriend up until last november i have been seen with more than one woman in the last few months so im an easy target for those kind of things
8836651 im not a sex addict i have never been to those meetings its hurtful to my family and if i was involved with a woman in a monogamous relationship it would be hurtful to her there was another story claiming i was a neat freak
8836652 if i had to choose one of the two i think id rather be a sex addict its not funny and ill be glad when it goes away

8836657 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away many people believe in it
8836658 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
8836659 after that my friends who work at garment factories in phnom penh advised me to apply the lubricant from number one plus condoms on my face every night
8836660 and just within three to four nights the acne on my face gradually and then totally disappeared
8836661 it probably wouldnt be as hip and as cool as the obama underwear
8836662 everywhere you go somebody wants a picture somebody wants an autograph somebody wants something from you
8836663 even when it comes from friends its hard to know who your friends are sometimes because everybody wants that association not everybody but a lot of people do thats something theyve got to deal with thats probably a little different than what they thought

8836678 ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
8836679 in a way which damages your reputation as a person suitable to work with or be associated with children and consequently the market for or value of the work is seriously diminished
8836680 publishers are so much less in need of protection than authors random is looking to remove all risk and liability from the publishing industry and move it to the author there is no childrens agent who wouldnt say childrens writers should be responsible and conscious of what they owe to children but this is counter productive
8836681 when ive checked it with authors they are just insulted i think the notion of it is so totally wrong what is considered unacceptable behaviour is subjective and can change from one week to another both sides take a risk and you have to deal with it if an author does something you dont like you dont publish them again
8836682 to cover very extreme and unusual circumstances where people do things widely considered as very inappropriate with children
8836683 we did have one particular incident where we suddenly realised that you have taken the book on in good faith but if the author does something which makes it hard to sell the book you have no protection
8836684 if anyone has queried it once our contracts department has explained the unusual and extreme things we are talking about the authors have then had no problem with it

8836695 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8836696 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur

8836719 the day passed uneventfully until shortly after 8 30pm when the train doors failed to open on arrival at edinburgh waverley and passengers were unable to get off the train
8836720 a cleaner attended at the conductors cab and observed gracie was asleep
8836721 he was unable to be awoken and the emergency release was activated to allow access to the cab
8836722 there was a strong smell of alcohol noticed on his breath and he immediately staggered onto the platform and had to be restrained to stop him staggering on to the tracks
8836723 he was supported by other members of staff on the way to the office and admitted to having been drinking
8836724 mr gracie accepts that he went into work drunk on this occasion
8836725 hes ashamed of himself and accepts that he has a drink problem
8836726 it stems from a diagnosis he had two and a half years ago
8836727 in the week running up to the offence a very close friend had died of the same illness and he was in a very emotional and grief stricken state
8836728 it broke into four good sized chunks in a controlled fall

8836731 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address their matters expeditiously
8836732 mr peters is offering his total cooperation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers including peter williams qc and the office will take place tomorrow morning
8836733 mr peters has been thinking very carefully about this its been clear to me this would be the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about this at all its accepted this is totally proper and there are precedents for it
8836734 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it

8836738 its quite frustrating health and safety in this country is sort of out of control but when you think weve been shot at by colombians then i suppose this is small fry

8836785 there was the temptation to go vic mackey if they didnt solve this real soon
8836786 but instead i spent a lot of time talking to people who are a lot smarter than me about what do we do now
8836787 i learned about the companies that run this business and politics leverage and power it was interesting to see how a group of lawyers treated the likes of carlton cuse lost and marc cherry desperate housewives and neal baer law amp order svu and carol mendelsohn csi crime scene investigation and people who have created properties that have made those companies so much money i didnt think it was right

8836789 as a writer your job is to explore the moral issues that interest you the most
8836790 you cant be principled without really thinking about whats right and wrong and i think clearly shawn has done that shawn was always fascinated with the moral ambiguities of characters and i think the psychopathology of vic mackey makes him one of the greatest characters thats been written for television
8836791 nash bridges writers rode with police officers in san francisco

8836796 i like songs that have a strong ending and books that have the confidence to end and say this or that
8836797 it looked like something out of a movie i couldnt believe it
8836798 in the two years i was there all you could hear is all these cars flying by and brakes screeching and every once in a while one of them would lose control
8836799 were going by witness accounts that the cars were racing
8836800 and once in a while like in the incident last night we suspect maybe the individuals just started racing each other but theres nothing to make us believe this was a planned race
8836801 the kaliakra wind power generation and sales project has been planned as a japanese bulgarian joint implementation project to reduce greenhouse gases sanctioned under the kyoto protocol framework
8836802 is emblematic of how innovations and investment are used to mask criminal encroachment on bio diversity
8836803 electricity prices do not rise in accordance with the will of the companies ie the owners of the electricity distribution companies they are regulated by the state that is why the companies turn to a shocking cutting of staff and decrease in investments which inevitably worsens the service thus everyone turned out to be dissatisfied the electricity distribution companies because of the low prices and benefits and the clients because of rising prices and worsening service
8836804 in its decision on prices which took effect on july 1 2008 sewrc state energy and water regulatory commission did not take into account e ons calculations and did not approve 48 per cent of the companys operative expenses which include two very important costs maintenance of the electricity distribution network and the salaries of our employees this decision is a great financial burden on e on bulgaria which forces us to cope with the situation by rationalising our activities and thus improving our effectiveness
8836805 the change will not affect the quality and speed of services
8836806 optimise its activity but would keep its high quality service
8836807 reducing staff will start by the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009
8836808 the main idea is staff optimisation we can provide the same quality with less staff
8836809 we announced the staff cuts officially as early as in april after the strike
8836810 we have an agreement with the strike committee and an approved programme for staff optimisation
8836811 nearly 4000 people work for cez bulgaria so the re organisation will affect only a small per cent of the company staff
8836812 these staff cuts specifically were not related to electricity prices but to optimisation
8836813 of course we are against the cutting of staff servicing the system will become more difficult their only grounds are the sewrc decision on prices and their benefits which would drop to 12 per cent they have decided that they would return their profit from staff
8836814 we already launched a sign up list to collect 50 per cent plus one vote in favour of a strike but the procedure is too complicated and slow
8836815 e on has cut 50 per cent of its staff through the years what do they want to work without people things are heading in a bad direction for sure service quality will drop well see what e on will do without people especially in winter in the region they are serving one famous for its freezes and heavy snowfall its bad even now
8836816 some of my friends are like whats wrong with you
8836817 a high school counselor told me about it i always liked science and math and it seemed like a great opportunity
8836818 its more competitive today to get into your college of choice than ever before
8836819 unfortunately its just something thats become necessary if you want to get ahead
8836820 to get accepted into some schools the competition is so steep and they have to decide if thats worth the price
8836821 i think some of the creativity gets kind of drilled out of them
8836822 its a lot of hours its intense we have homework
8836823 my parents are kind of making me but i know it will be totally worthwhile when i take the sat
8836824 the jump is because high school students are starting earlier to work on their college degree
8836825 theyre very ambitious they seem to have a much clearer vision of what they are going to do with their lives than my peers did when i was in high school they know where they want to go they know where they want to be and they know what theyre going to do to reach those goals its really impressive

8836827 on august 1 an infected wild fox attacked a home dog in the vladaya suburb all animals in vladaya are now under quarantine there is a danger of rabies spreading among street dogs in sofia forty cases of rabies are registered annually in bulgaria and almost half of them are on the territory of sofia and the surrounding region
8836828 there is absolutely no danger of rabies spreading among homeless dogs in sofia there is no single case of a stray dog infected with rabies in vladaya even more during the past two years we have been vaccinating all stray dogs against rabies it is possible that this announcement is an attack from the government aimed against the municipality
8836829 if there is anyone who objects to this union please speak now or forever hold your peace
8836830 the puppies got to know me and when i called for them they would come running knowing i had food then one day i called and one of the pups was missing i didnt think anything of it but the next day it happened again so i thought ill take a walk round and discovered this little pup stuck behind a set of ladders with his side ripped wide open he had been savagely attacked so took him straight to the vet and i found that he had been shot too i paid for an operation to remove the bullet and stitch him up he came home with me after that as i was fearful it would happen again
8836831 direct violation of un security council resolutions rubberstamped by russia as well
8836832 russias decision today confirms that its invasion of georgia was part of a broader premeditated plan to redraw the map of europe russia today has violated all treaties and agreements that it has previously signed
8836833 raised serious concern bulgaria again re affirms its unconditional support for the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia in its internationally recognised borders
8836834 in violation of the un charter its commitments under international agreements and in defiance of common sense the georgian leadership began an armed conflict the decision is not easy but it is the only way to save peoples lives you know what is happening in south ossetia

8836838 the good thing is by sunday well be looking at a high in the low 90s
8836839 but one of the long lasting consequences of prop 187
8836840 was it mobilized substantial numbers of latinos to become citizens and register to vote and they did so mostly as democrats
8836841 there are no excuses but were doing everything we can to catch these errors
8836842 were glad to see that our inspection process is catching these really odd ones
8836843 well be more aggressive in looking at the individual meters at those combined billing sites
8836844 weve done so much training together weve been through a whole lot were like a big family
8836845 i feel he needs to man up to what he did
8836846 is improper visual communication with the jury it allows him to convey his occupation and a sense of responsibility and credibility to the jury without him having to take the stand
8836847 would be presenting himself in the same clothing he wears in the community everyday
8836848 just as police officers are allowed to convey their occupation and a sense of responsibility and credibility to the jury by wearing their uniforms in court the defendant is entitled to the very same right
8836849 for no reason that i have heard thats compelling other than potentially influencing the jury
8836850 my gut sense is the judge was wrong and it will create a nice appealable issue if the guys convicted
8836851 why distinguish between a nice business suit and a uniform if the guys in the service
8836852 hes changed as a person to where he holds the values that the army stands for as his own
8836853 right back where he started he came from nothing no family no positive influences
8836854 i noticed in high school i didnt have a straight back
8836855 but then right when that uniform came on it was like a soldier mentality came to me and the fact im able to be called a soldier thats kind of cool look at that soldier thats some hype
8836856 i see as many wild and stupid drivers out there as ever
8836857 theyre changing lanes without signaling if theres two feet to spare theyll cut right in

8836866 russia asserts that both sides need to fulfil the obligations they accepted
8836867 we are verifying the adverts and the data in this case but our first impression is that the company is using unfair practices and is misleading consumers
8836868 for us the protests have achieved very little and we have given up on them
8836869 the minimum salary in bulgaria is 220 leva and the least that they can give us is double that
8836870 you have to realise that we are starting negotiations from a very low base and it is funny to hear politicians say that salaries have gone up by 50 or 100 per cent salaries in schools and kindergartens are even lower there nurses used to get 180 leva which is ridiculous now we have a salary of 360 leva i doubt that most people would like to work under such conditions
8836871 in varnas case it was either that or the hospital would have closed down
8836872 first of all we were promised this 440 leva and second these are carrot and stick tactics after all like any other employees nurses are free to choose where they work and if you dont like what you get paid you have every right to go to work somewhere else why cant nurses do the same thing when a shop assistant can get 800 leva a month
8836873 i mean that after all people need someone to look after them not only to diagnose them
8836874 if you look at the protests that medical workers have been staging in the past two years you will see that it was the nurses who organised them the doctors simply joined in they have little to complain about because they have the opportunity to work at private clinics at the end of their shifts while nurses cant
8836875 currently there are about 30 000 with 1200 nurses leaving the country every year
8836876 this does not much help the quality of the healthcare service in bulgaria
8836877 british nurses are migrating to the us and finlands nurses are going to sweden and norway
8836878 what we have in most cases are people graduating as nurses only to go abroad and work as personal medical assistants
8836879 we have experienced the polish plumber now meet the bulgarian nurse
8836880 spectacularly over qualified for the jobs they take up in britain
8836881 we will soon have a meeting with the three ruling parties to discuss the situation
8836882 it is necessary for us to see clear and concrete results in the fight against corruption and fraud in bulgaria this includes the judiciary and in returning funds
8836883 bulgaria as an eu member also relies on olaf we havent discussed matters in detail our efforts were aimed at once more establishing the principle of communication among us
8836884 we need to tell our partners what we have achieved more often because much of it has remained secret to them
8836885 and this is only part of what has been going on i am certain that half of the matches in every round are fixed
8836886 i said no and when later minyor won the game that person asked me if alexandrov had bought me a drink with the 5000 leva that had been given to alexandrov
8836887 guess which was the right direction i did not take
8836888 i refereed the second division game svetkavitsa vs dobroudja lozev asked me to help svetkavitsa but i refused and this made them very nervous and i got sanctioned at the end
8836889 i have decided to withdraw from the profession because of the attitude that alexandrov has towards me i have phone records proving that alexandrov tried to influence me in refereeing a couple of matches from last years season but i stood my ground then the problems started ivan lekov a member of bfus executive committee also tried to blackmail me and offer me better positions on bfus referee list so that i could referee uefa games i think it is my duty to inform you about all this
8836890 lozev had a special bag that he can hide underneath his coat when travelling abroad where he use to hide the free chocolate and beer from the business lounges at airports how can i respect such a person
8836891 hurt here yes good excellent hmmm what about here no bad hmmm better call in my brother
8836892 we must operate today no this morning it is very urgent we have no time to lose
8836893 yes there is no doubt in my mind your appendix is about to explode mr british man kerrrbooom it is like a festering nuke power station and if we dont whip it out immediately there is a good chance you could die how you say it go six feet under
8836894 yes we have crisis maybe no need to remove appendix after all

8836937 ive never felt like this before i totally melt when i see him i dont know what to do
8836938 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x want you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8836939 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8836940 i only have friends in chelsea and i have problems with nobody but if i stayed there one two three four more weeks probably in this moment i wouldnt say this
8836941 i love that club im in the history of that club and i left the club in the right moment to feel like that and to say that honestly
8836942 its certainly not our intention to imply that immigrants are responsible for global warming
8836943 immigrants in the united states produce an estimated four times more carbon dioxide in the united states as they would have in their countries of origin
8836944 if they were included the impact would be much higher
8836945 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8836946 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8836947 the players are in good shape and ready to learn and the other thing is that they are young with so much potential
8836948 its part of our job and i am sure we still have lots to learn from each other and learning first names makes me become part of them which makes everything smooth for me
8836949 maji gives us a lot of trouble as we train at almost the same ground and i know it will not be an easy game

8836955 hes developed so much hes talking a lot more its a great surprise

8836957 everybody here and there was very supportive were very thankful it was a positive experience as much as it can be

8836966 no my dear friend to attend the launch ceremony of chiranjeevis political party
8836967 how was it i mean what did you get from attending the ceremony
8836968 im not an expert to comment on the future of his endeavor i went there with a question in my mind and i came back with the same
8836969 what would i say perhaps they find no scope in continuing with cinema
8836970 i dont know yaar and i dont want to spoil my mood over a topic like politics after drinks
8836971 they were super stars of tamil cinema and later entered politics and became chief ministers of tamil nadu ntr for that matter i think he too came into politics after cinema come to bollywood dharmendra govinda jayaprada were all famous cine stars but later put their feet in politics
8836972 but why thats the question is it because they think their huge fan base can fetch them the required no of votes or is it because they seriously want to contribute something to the development of the society or is it because other political parties are encashing on their star image for confirming a seat in an assembly or parliament
8836973 some of them have been successful some of them not the last to join the list is chiranjeevi and some more may follow
8836974 would you like to see vijay entering politics will you support him if he does so
8836975 i admire vijay for his acting talents hes the best actor according to me but he may not be the best politician whom i would like to support
8836976 there you are its sure that all the fans of an actor may not support him or her as a politician while he or she can encash his star value to some extent needs to build up an entirely different political image as its not their cup of coffee they have to start from the basics if they can prove themselves there theyre in else they may be back to cinema as a producer or director
8836977 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw coin play before so i didnt know what to expect
8836978 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8836979 i think i just had a lot more power than she did today
8836980 she plays a game where she hits a lot of high balls i think it would be effective against a lot of players but with my height and my reach it doesnt phase me as much i think that helped me
8836981 hes been training with us and i liked him i think peter storrie pompey chief executive has made him an offer of a short term contract but i dont know where he is at with that
8836982 he has had a bad knee but if thats all right hes a good player
8836983 but i saw him play against chelsea two or three years ago for barcelona and he was fantastic that night in the middle of the park
8836984 the problem for berbatov is that he is playing for spurs and they are not fighting for the title they are not fighting for any place in the champions league
8836985 he is a young player who has propositions from big clubs and he wants to play at the top
8836986 players have more freedom nowadays there is no point asking a player to play for you if he is not happy
8836987 im less optimistic today ive no idea what is going on
8836988 it is hard to communicate with some people in this life we just have to get on with it

8836993 it was frightening i took my nurse with and she is still battling to recover from the experience
8836994 he moaned a bit but didnt scream once he even told us his name and where we could find his mother
8836995 many female cats in heat came to harass him and then the wings started to grow
8836996 i look at blu ray being the obvious short term differentiator but if everything goes to digital download and over time it will then the blu ray device no longer has the same competitive advantage or the benefit is not as strong as the feature is
8836997 perhaps maybe five years maybe seven years i think the challenge with digital distribution is more because of piped to the home bandwidth than the technology within the systems
8836998 the ps3 has a nice upscaling chipset that really does make a standard definition dvd look a little bit crisper and better
8836999 is that enough to get you to buy one console versus the other as opposed to someone who is buying it for a game franchise
8837000 over time i think youve always seen software drive hardware selections if the game franchises are all available on everything its sort of hard to know

8837008 because were all too busy clicking on consoles with eyes glued to a screen
8837009 but instead of getting fresh air they were wearing out our carpet their thumb joints and my patience
8837010 the major difference lies in the fact that nintendo makes money with the hardware alone which may be a superior business model
8837011 but the wii is not succeeding at our expense it is not hurting us we decided years ago to build a game console that offers much greater functionality the playstation 3 has an enormous processor it is gradually emerging as the central server in our users homes
8837012 not for as long as i live it will certainly take some time the traditional business model for the playstation envisaged us making a loss with the hardware in the early years until the production costs had decreased to a point that enabled us to break even
8837013 in the meantime we earn money with the games we are currently at the stage in which we need to get a grip on the production costs that takes time we are already making more money with the games than we are losing with the hardware
8837014 its a different experience the wii is a well made device that has found a new target group for a while we held the same target group with the singstar karaoke game but perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue
8837015 playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off we currently have a production bottleneck with the playstation 3
8837016 how realistic is that here we are this little company with 15 to 20 guys in cambridge massachusetts
8837017 hey guys the wii has done really well lets start making game controllers
8837018 are you working with microsoft are you working with sony are you working with this company are you working with that company
8837019 its not about winning or losing i no we started this ps3 trophies
8837020 the increase in net income was due to favorable market conditions high refinery margins and increases in refinery throughputs as well as due to effective cost control

8837043 they gave us a package of work that we would size spec analyse and then build
8837044 it made a difference in the tender process for a project of this scale to have a fixed price
8837045 we hear so much about these types of projects going over budget
8837046 we built in some costs so there has been an allowance for the additional cost of a more interative development style
8837047 we didnt dictate how the solution should be executed it was up to sydney waters discretion

8837103 publishing the names of these 1227 people has two main aims
8837104 first it seeks public recognition for the families of the missing and acknowledgement of their suffering and needs secondly the publication constitutes an appeal to the government of nepal to clarify the fate of those who went missing during the conflict and to meet the immediate needs of their families
8837105 that the authorities establish mechanisms to resolve the legal problems faced by the families of the missing persons and to support them in overcoming their loss one frequent problem is that women cannot inherit the property of the person who has disappeared as the missing person has not been declared dead

8837110 a unique presence in washington a genuinely loving spiritual mentor and guide to anyone regardless of party or faith who wants to deepen his or her relationship with god
8837111 the idea is to create an alternative route starting from sikkims eastern part near rongli into bhutans pangola range that separates sikkim from bhutan and on to phuentsholing before it re enters indian territory at chalsa in the dooars region an aerial survey will be conducted for the route from the first week of september soon after the route feasibility will be studied on foot that is likely to take a month
8837112 the secretary appreciated our view that the only solution to sikkims accessibility problems lies in an alternative route he suggested that we go ahead with a feasibility after which the ministry would approach the ministry of external affairs mea to further take up the issue with bhutan
8837113 a proposal for routing this access through bhutan or nepal and into bangladesh was considered at a meeting while no final decision was taken at our end it is understood that sikkim does need an alternative to nh 31a

8837125 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
8837126 i think anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd
8837127 anytime you say anything to anybody about the obama campaign it immediately becomes a racist attack
8837128 should pretend every time they talk to me or even look at me that im a gray haired southern gentleman a senator from texas

8837140 we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to christ
8837141 you turned my wailing into dancing you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy that my heart may sing to you and not be silent o lord my god i will give you thanks forever in you o lord i have taken refuge let me never be put to shame deliver me in your righteousness turn your ear to me come quickly to my rescue be my rock of refuge a strong fortress to save me since you are my rock and my fortress for the sake of your name lead and guide me free me from the trap that is set for me for you are my refuge into your hands i commit my spirit redeem me o lord the god of truth

8837143 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8837144 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8837145 hes been training with us and i liked him i think peter storrie pompey chief executive has made him an offer of a short term contract but i dont know where he is at with that
8837146 he has had a bad knee but if thats all right hes a good player
8837147 but i saw him play against chelsea two or three years ago for barcelona and he was fantastic that night in the middle of the park

8837155 akan muncul setelahku para pemimpin yang tidak mengambil petunjuk dari petunjukku amp tidak mengikuti sunnahku dan akan tegak diantara mereka orang2 yg hatinya adalah hati syaitan dalam jasad manusia

8837160 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x want you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8837161 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8837162 i only have friends in chelsea and i have problems with nobody but if i stayed there one two three four more weeks probably in this moment i wouldnt say this
8837163 i love that club im in the history of that club and i left the club in the right moment to feel like that and to say that honestly
8837164 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8837165 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8837166 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
8837167 i was nervous going onto the court because i never saw coin play before so i didnt know what to expect
8837168 i thought i can slowly get into the match and she played completely different than i expected she was serving extremely well and hitting very powerful shots
8837169 i think i just had a lot more power than she did today
8837170 she plays a game where she hits a lot of high balls i think it would be effective against a lot of players but with my height and my reach it doesnt phase me as much i think that helped me
8837171 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8837172 that friday morning it was headed toward pensacola by friday evening it was headed straight for mississippi
8837173 we are following our evacuation plan and if its a category 3 or 4 we want to have the port evacuated 48 hours before landfall
8837174 even if its not logical to be nervous i am its just the general way people get when somethings out there
8837175 i just hope everybody will realize we are building this from the grass roots up
8837176 our main mission is to get people back in their houses restore the work force and bring back the customer base it is a complicated process
8837177 weve got to solve this problem weve got big employers on the mississippi gulf coast that were in jeopardy of losing over housing big employers and those people who want to live in the country if they mess around and keep us from having housing they will be a lot closer to living in the country and with a few thousand less jobs
8837178 oh if only we had our own yard i would plant more gardens than you could shake a stick at
8837179 we are very excited about this new partnership and the value it adds to our ruby on rails hosting solutions
8837180 we first used the fiveruns management tool a few months ago and were incredibly impressed with the level of detail functionality and ease of use this partnership really gives brightbox a competitive advantage
8837181 restart to move out of live cd onto the actual installed linux
8837182 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8837183 if we could see the miracle of a single flower clearly our whole life would change
8837184 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick

8837187 this guide does not have to be followed its based on my experiences opinions and research playing a wk uptil 123 spearman uptil level 59 and closely watching a crusader uptil level 103 so i highly recommend it i made this guide because my first two warriors were horribly messed up both in terms of stats and skills which misguided me into thinking warriors were weak and led to me to making a magician just to come back to being a warrior i do not mind if you post this guide somewhere else as long as you give credit also keep in mind the abbreviations i will use i will include some warrior ones that i wont use as well just to help you out
8837188 there we go im only putting 9 mw and 20 hh due to the fact that horned tail isnt released whenever ht is released and gms can efficiently kill it and enough supplies of said mastery books mw 20 hh 30 can be put in the market then it can be switched
8837189 until and unless the situation comes by to normal and our drivers are not harassed we will not send any vehicles from the plains to the hills the gorkha janmukti morcha cadres are forcefully blackening the west bengal registration numbers and asking us to put gorkhaland vehicle registration numbers how is it possible for us we are not from darjeeling hills this type of unprovoked harassment must stop
8837190 he will come here next month before he goes for the un general assemblys meeting in new york scheduled for the third week of september we are working out mutually convenient dates
8837191 it will be his first political visit to any country
8837192 dont read too much into it the china visit had he become prime minister at the time of the saarc summit he would have first gone to sri lanka
8837193 ties with india are in a different category its a pointless controversy
8837194 they face the ongoing pain of not knowing if their loved one is dead or alive and if dead in which circumstances he or she died
8837195 this information they need in order to complete their process of mourning their lost loved ones
8837196 the problems vexing darjeeling hills can only be solved through negotiation and discussion we are not in favour of the division of state we were instead in favour of a powerful autonomous administration
8837197 i suggest that gorkha janmukti morcha refrains itself from violating the law and spreading violence in the hills if it is to be taken seriously as a political force it should also refrain from forcibly enforcing gl registration numbers and socially boycotting opposition leaders and supporters and if this continues there could be chances that the tripartite meeting may be not fruitful gjm must come to the table with an open mind gjm leaders must also keep up with their responsibility as a political party
8837198 gorkha national liberation front had won the council elections and hence been bestowed with the reigns of darjeeling gorkha hill council but their failure ultimately led to their ouster similarly gorkha janmukti morcha must also participate in elections to be able to be bestowed with authority
8837199 i have met the superintendent of police on the issue of forcible implementation of gl vehicle registration numbers he has assured me of swift legal action against any one founding enforcing gl vehicle registration numbers or blackening of wb vehicle registration numbers
8837200 those attending the tripartite meeting should be asked to categorically reject sixth schedule
8837201 until and unless the situation comes by to normal and our drivers are not harassed we will not send any vehicles from the plains to the hills the gorkha janmukti morcha cadres are forcefully blackening the west bengal registration numbers and asking us to put gorkhaland vehicle registration numbers how is it possible for us we are not from darjeeling hills this type of unprovoked harassment must stop
8837202 those attending the tripartite meeting should be asked to categorically reject sixth schedule
8837203 we will only consider attending the tripartite meeting at new delhi after receiving an invitation from the central government
8837204 nothing can be said at this moment only gjm has been invited why should we tag along with them and seat at the benches when the main match is going on there will be no talk on gorkhaland only the inclusion of gorkhaland in the agenda will be discussed upon the most important thing that will be discussed in this meeting would be autonomy
8837205 sixth schedule is not yet categorically out of the realm of parliamentary overview we in fact have demanded that the union home minister repealed the sixth schedule from the union parliament no one has ever deliberated on it unless and until this is completely repealed nothing can be worked upon
8837206 they must categorically reject sixth schedule all the delegations made by parties from the hills will be useless unless the recommendations made by the parliamentary standing committee on home affairs were reviewed dawa narbula the darjeeling member of parliament knows this he should make this clear to the people it is his responsibility since things are on the negative and hence he discusses in closed doors at patlebas instead of speaking out to the people through chowk bazaar now we should also not be discussing about this in closed doors what we need now is an all party meeting it will be a good idea to call for an all party meeting and come out with unanimous voice we were all supposed to have attended these meetings together why were other parties not invited to go along with them to kolkata everybody blames us for been too suspicious but we have been suspicious because there has been reason to be suspicious we are in fact suspicious today that covertly work is on for the formation of gorkha autonomous council

8837216 if we are aware of this and if we will help analyze the anatomy of crisis and its beginning we will notice that the crisis always begins within family of origin

8837345 it will be awesome when we get on the field at the same time together
8837346 he is a good athlete and a good receiver and he catches the ball well im anxious to see how he blocks that is something that is hard to simulate those live looks in practice because they are pretty big collisions with the fullbacks and the linebackers you try to save that for saturdays im anxious to see how he plays and how physical he plays

8837382 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8837383 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8837384 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8837385 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8837386 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8837387 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8837388 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center

8837394 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
8837395 there was absolutely nothing that conflicted with his strategic image as an average working joe

8837424 ellisons compensation was already sky high and didnt need to go higher
8837425 that kind of package becomes a red flag for investors
8837426 yes it was a lot higher than people expected but conditions are dramatically different now than they were in the second quarter
8837427 the fact that foreign demand for our goods has been supporting the u s economy puts us in a very precarious situation should world economic growth slow more than expected
8837428 business conditions are expected to remain challenging at least through our third fiscal quarter resulting in losses and negative operating cash flows

8837431 i think we may have a group of short sellers who arent too worried about the rules

8837437 this immoral smear campaign that obama has so cynically began against a fine man in john mccain with this speech is inedifying and the american people will treat it with the contempt it deserves

8837462 if youre sitting in a train coming to zurich in the morning youre not aware of how many computers there are in the train controlling the engines and the signals and making you go down the right tracks but youre very dependent on them and you want them to work
8837463 embedded systems are at the forefront of many challenges in computing they are often highly concurrent asynchronous and required to work with high reliability
8837464 therefore we require programming tools that enable the rapid production of verifiable trustworthy software
8837465 it has to be a reliant system that doesnt fail it has to keep on working
8837466 in the future you will have more and more safety critical applications where you cannot afford a single drop out for me it is a radically different mindset if you have to develop systems that are 100 per cent safety critical
8837467 in the future this separation will no longer be valued so much
8837468 while the transition to digital music collections has improved and simplified our lives in many ways it has made them more difficult in others
8837469 we created tuneup to make it simple to organize and complete your music collection at the same time we wanted to create a way for people to explore their music and find new content without having to leave itunes as a music lover i use many of the new technologies and services out there yet still felt something fundamental was missing from my own music library this is why we created tuneup
8837470 that is just part of daily business and should not be overrated

8837489 hip hop drum n bass techno dubstep all these styles that come out of the urban landscape are really just part of the global conversation of how technology is changing the way we think about culture
8837490 ill be riffing on music as information to me its all about patterns and beats its all code at the end of the day
8837491 im going to focus on the arc of recording how the idea of recording itself has changed creativity
8837492 when you look at spookys career it really is about someone who is unafraid to explore sound in all its forms and use technology to reconstruct things
8837493 music fans from the toronto hip hop scene can be highly critical theyre not easy to please so for this to have some kind of cachet it had to be somebody who could not only reach out to the urban world but also cross some bridges spooky captures a lot of the elements that make the culture interesting from an innovation standpoint
8837494 one of the big things were doing this year is a special dance component dance has become the staple of television these days now that weve seen the best that america has on those dance shows i think people realize how much talent we have here locally
8837495 the main concert takes place at the cne so there might be some artists whose material might not be as family friendly as one would want it to be this allows us to deal with a wider swath of artistic talent

8837498 it was underground all i could see were the sandaled feet of people walking on the sidewalk outside that was all i got out of a nice day
8837499 you know we all are just struggling in our own way to be free
8837500 i didnt want to fall into a trap of being overly sincere or alienating people
8837501 i was sensitive to the idea that if i was going to sing the songs that i wanted to sing i would have to make them entertaining
8837502 i wanted to make the music about more than me because me isnt really all that interesting
8837503 long before i was probably ready to do it i knew it was what i was going to do
8837504 this whole adventure is kind of a conversion of experience from fear

8837518 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8837519 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8837520 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8837521 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8837522 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8837523 if you look over the last 10 years life expectancy has improved across the board but its improved more for people with high education than it has for people with low education
8837524 behavior and lifestyle are determined by the circumstances in which people find themselves
8837525 the u s invests probably less in improving that social gradient there are countries that really invest in making sure that all children have quality education regardless of the education of their parents there are countries that invest in making sure that everybody has access to a minimum level of quality of health care were one of the few countries that does not do that
8837526 health equity within a generation is achievable it is the right thing to do and now is the right time to do it
8837527 were wasting a lot of the money that we invest in health and health care
8837528 all sorts of studies show that targeting the social determinants of health is more cost effective for everybody not just for those at the bottom everybody in this country whether they know it or not suffers from a system that is not committed to closing that health gap

8837533 nobody can limit the use of knowledge anywhere in the world
8837534 nigeria is never entering into any agreement with iran for any matter that has to do with weapons
8837535 there shouldnt be a misunderstanding between exploration or uses of energy to provide power and the uses of energy for weapons so that our relationship with iran will not be misconstrued by nigerians and the entire international community
8837536 i see the olympics as swimming track and field weightlifting sports where the olympics is the pinnacle
8837537 for us the pinnacle is four times a year in the majors its the way its always been
8837538 if it didnt get in the way of anything else it would be great to hang out in the olympic village id be doing it more for that than actually playing the olympics
8837539 i cant tell you who won tennis at the last olympics
8837540 i dont think theres any place for golf in the olympics i didnt grow up looking to win an olympic medal i grew up trying to win a green jacket

8837544 we think certainly we have some really really good quarterbacks and they are going to need some help from the people around them
8837545 i havent seen all the offensive lines in the pac 10 but i would think this rates toward the top
8837546 they have been together very quick a smaller line than weve seen in practice so it will be a little bit of a tempo thing when they see this group
8837547 theres a lot of got to find the ball against these guys
8837548 thats not hype thats a pretty good test for us early but were just going to have to find out where we stand obviously if we can have success against them then we are pretty good
8837549 but obviously i think kavario has shown himself to be very productive in a lot of areas and as he continues to grow and get better he could be one of those guys that begins to share the lions share of the time
8837550 im even probably willing to think they may have some things in place that may not even involve a quarterback
8837551 voor het eerst in 23 jaar heb ik met een amerikaans vlaggetje gezwaaid
8837552 we will be a good team with a chance to be a great team
8837553 i told the 2003 team the same thing and the 2004 team and the 2005 team how we work how deliberate we become when we learn how we make changes we need to make by becoming very mindful each day will determine how good we become in november and december
8837554 can we become the expert time will tell this team has a chance
8837555 we have got a real problem with motivating our young people
8837556 we have got to teach our managers in how to manage generation y as they are high maintenance and needy we need to hand hold them as they absolutely want to know where their career is going
8837557 our younger people are the least motivated its about how we communicate to them when i left school i did whatever my manager asked theyve got some great ideas but we need to get them out of them we have to understand not one management approach fits all
8837558 one of the reasons arnie arnold palmer is playing so well is that before each tee shot his wife takes out his balls and kisses them oh my god what have i just said

8837582 ninety feet between bases is perhaps as close as man ever come to perfection
8837583 im a four wheel drive pickup type of guy so is my wife
8837584 they have missed so many chances they must be wringing their heads in shame
8837585 people think we make 3 million and 4 million a year they dont realize that most of us only make 500 000

8837624 i think i did okay he said after completing the race in about 17 minutes with the assistance of crutches a respectable time just over double the winners mark
8837625 i really gutsed it out today it was definitely a tough run probably the hardest i have run on the stairs so far mr mctaggart said
8837626 its not a bad way to go because you probably start off a bit easier than potentially what you would run you might have a little bit left at the end he said
8837627 hes so easy going so sweet he loves his job

8837657 you know i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8837658 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8837659 rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8837660 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8837661 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home
8837662 enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured
8837663 obamas life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8837664 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8837665 he was very respectful to his wifes campaign but at the same time showed that he was really behind barack and really helped to unite the party
8837666 bill clinton just capitalized on everything we should be about
8837667 he took a moment to remind us that we must be together he provided the unity i have a newfound respect for him
8837668 suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote all votes passed by the delegates will be counted and that our sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclimation as the nominee of the democratic party
8837669 sen clinton has moved in the spirit of unity to suspend the rules of the convention and to nominate barack obama by acclimation as the presidential candidate of the democratic party is there a second
8837670 all in favor of the motion to suspend the rules and nominate by acclimation barack obama as the democratic partys presidential candidate please say aye all those opposed say no
8837671 volunteers in 21 cities and 12 states will distribute voter guides and vote reminders in what will be the nations largest non partisan get out the vote canvass
8837672 i brought it all the way from georgia and i am going to wear it it was a gift from my children and they are very active in politics as i
8837673 what well hear tonight is the speech of a future president
8837674 it showed he could energize a crowd and that even then he had the qualities of a leader his acceptance speech is a culmination of that moment
8837675 it can destroy a reputation or it can give you a reputation
8837676 the expectations are so great if his speech isnt one of the greatest speeches ever delivered it will fall flat
8837677 he has to hit it out of the park thats a lot of pressure
8837678 obamas been running this marathon and he hasnt broken away yet
8837679 if he nails the speech hell get a jump which he needs
8837680 the bar is set pretty high so it will have to be good to meet everyones expectations
8837681 i think hes going to change the world for the better and he knows how to do it
8837682 its kind of crazy during the day but everyone seems really interested in what the speakers have to say
8837683 the convention is really energized but its really chaotic also
8837684 the convention is more energy than i have felt in any space in my entire life
8837685 i think more than even her personal speaking skills which are great she had a lot to say on obama
8837686 he was a great public speaker just the way he went about it was really inspiring
8837687 i thought that the youth wouldnt be very involved with the convention but i saw a lot of people my age very interested in getting involved
8837688 its been great to get to know them through our work
8837689 its made me view the democratic party as more of a party more unified
8837690 the party isnt all politicians its anyone who considers themselves a democrat
8837691 whats stood out to me is the republicans speaking at the convention
8837692 it shows the openness of the democratic party theyll let anyone talk who is for obama
8837693 i learned a lot more about the inner workings of the party and the theatrics of the convention
8837694 i definitely have a greater appreciation for the people who put this together
8837695 i love going downtown periodically to see the new exhibits that come in
8837696 its a great place to relax do homework and chat with friends
8837697 the denver slam team won nationals in 2006 and that is where they practice
8837698 this moment this election is our chance to keep the american promise alive
8837699 john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction
8837700 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8837701 the truth is on issue after that would make a difference in your lives senator mccain has been anything but independent
8837702 he said that our economy has made great progress under this president
8837703 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8837704 now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single american
8837705 as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer i will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most
8837706 i will renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
8837707 one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8837708 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8837709 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states of america
8837710 a big family and sometimes were going to have arguments over this and that and express frustrations but over all i think its important that we remind ourselves that wha
8837711 we look forward to supporting her and getting her elected
8837712 to be part of his 300th game on the weekend will be awesome
8837713 i just hope we can reward him with a win
8837714 it would have been ideal for me to finish with the club playing good football but i guess thats football isnt it
8837715 whether we win or lose were going to be in the same position on the ladder so its more about us getting our processes right and certainly the style but more importantly we thought we turned the corner a little last week as far as form for some individuals and as a team wed like to keep that going
8837716 weve got a lot of respect for the adelaide football club they really are a good honest side who just work hard for each other and even if they werent playing for a home final you know youre going to get a great contest from them so its a great lead in for us for finals theres no doubt
8837717 i think in the belief factor were better i think after last seasons disappointment we had a fairly solid pre season and it was a matter of getting some wins on the board to cement some belief
8837718 there was a bit of anxiety amongst the group going in to round one but having a victory early i think was a catalyst for us to get a good roll on to the next seven or eight weeks
8837719 we want to see a response from last week with the way we went about our footy
8837720 we were very disappointed and we should be because the way we went about it after quarter time was so far away from the way we want to play the way we want to be perceived and our desired style of play
8837721 we need to correct that really quickly because it wont be anywhere near good enough in finals
8837722 full of romance humor rivalry and betrayal a passion most pure will captivate readers from the first page
8837723 i loved julie lessmans a passion most pure from the second i picked it up until the very last moment i stopped reading
8837724 i devoured this book and loved every single page this is a thick juicy read and one i would pick up again in a heartbeat
8837725 it would take too long to explain all the changes i have made i will present a lot of it to you in the ring
8837726 i have prepared very hard and very long i am in very good shape i want to win
8837727 i feel fit and ready to deliver a good fight again
8837728 i am here in germany to get the belt back
8837729 i have worked very hard in practice with my coach i am in great shape and i will show that
8837730 on saturday the two best heavyweight boxers will meet in the ring
8837731 but this time the ending will be different from their last meeting
8837732 you will see that john ruiz will be world champion again
8837733 i see the olympics as swimming track and field weightlifting sports where the olympics is the pinnacle
8837734 for us the pinnacle is four times a year in the majors its the way its always been
8837735 if it didnt get in the way of anything else it would be great to hang out in the olympic village id be doing it more for that than actually playing the olympics
8837736 i cant tell you who won tennis at the last olympics
8837737 i dont think theres any place for golf in the olympics i didnt grow up looking to win an olympic medal i grew up trying to win a green jacket
8837738 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
8837739 the physical removal of abc reporter asa eslocker from public property and his subsequent arrest are a blatant assault on the first amendment arresting a reporter for simply doing his job is both unconstitutional and un american that free speech is curtailed during the democratic convention underscores the need for continued protection of civil liberties regardless of the party in power
8837740 the use of unnecessary force and the arrest of a journalist who was reporting an important political story is deeply troubling and unacceptable
8837741 the attempts at intimidation that were evident in the captured images of eslockers arrest simply because he refused to leave a shared publicly used space reflect negatively on the denver police and sheriffs departments commitment to uphold a journalists right to gather important news
8837742 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8837743 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8837744 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8837745 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8837746 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8837747 damit l uft ein programm an dass eltern in ihrem engagement um das wohl und die erziehung ihrer kinder aktiv unterst tzt
8837748 wir wollen eltern vermitteln dass ihre erziehungsarbeit gew rdigt und die manchmal auch schwierigen erziehungsaufgaben ernst genommen werden
8837749 es gilt aufgeschlossenheit gegen ber erziehungsbildung zu f rdern und hemmungen abzubauen beratungsangebote und gespr chsaustausch ber kindererziehung und familienarbeit in anspruch zu nehmen
8837750 mit dieser komponente kann auch m ttern und v tern in untypischen und komplizierten lebensumst nden individuell entgegen gekommen werden
8837751 all other things being equal the simplest solution is the best

8837753 here where the air is loaded with iodine and where the ultra violet ray is ever present in our smiling sunshine your health and happiness is our business
8837754 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
8837755 runs the gamut from shirley maclaines belief in crystals to the approach of many psychiatrists who believe in the importance of nature and beauty as it relates to health
8837756 we rethought every step of the patient experience asking how can we do this better we knew if we focused on the patient everything would follow the core belief of planetree is that family and friends must be partners in the healing process so every effort is being made to reflect this approach
8837757 the prairies are made up of sturdy plants which could survive the conditions of the times including the bison which trampled them the fires caused either by lightning or indians and which burned them back and the droughts the plants that survived were suited to their environment and the indians learned to use these plants and believed that beauty turns the spirit to self healing to create healing gardens with native prairie plants will result in something beautiful that will renew the patients experiencing it
8837758 at the beginning of the 20th century three things changed the way we raise cattle liquid nitrogen fertilizer the development of hybrid corn and the depression era subsidies to farmers which were supposed to end after the depression but never did the corn crop increased so dramatically that it was fed to cattle to further increase beef yield while cutting costs cattle were pumped with hormones and concentrated in small areas while they ate corn and were fattened for market however being in such close quarters exposed them to infection so they were given antibiotics in fact 70 percent of the antibiotics in the u s go to cattle resulting in e coli outbreaks and bacteria resistant to these antibiotics
8837759 i dont think the king woke up one morning said all people should be better paid no things were bad but things got changed plenty tough union made
8837760 its a hard job just gettin by with nine kids and a wife
8837761 my heart it skips a beat therell be fighting in the street my sweethearts on the barricade
8837762 im headin into tear gas dig in man hold your ground

8837766 love is noise love is pain love is these blues im singing again
8837767 once i found it was an old theater i knew i was meant to be here
8837768 artists should not stay in one range because our minds are so creative i believe we shortchange ourselves and we should be brave enough to venture out
8837769 once i found it was an old theater i knew i was meant to be here
8837770 her talent is so wonderful and i didnt expect this much when i walked in
8837771 you could come in five or six times and not notice all of the work here
8837772 i think shes really gotten into something good with this gallery
8837773 looking up ringside i saw the associated press reporters with their typewriters and thought thats for me
8837774 each day i would buy all five dailies scan them and rewrite the stories
8837775 he could type as fast with the hunt and peck method than the rest of us could in the proper method
8837776 we were ready to set off 1 600 sticks of dynamite and lightning hit 35 feet away it blew me up and i have a steel plate in my head
8837777 he sent me out to find a story and i wrote i met an old friend again today
8837778 i intended to stay a year because i wanted to start a weekly
8837779 but i fell in love with bill brown and stayed 18 years
8837780 he was what i would call a fountain of information
8837781 when he sat at the typewriter out it came he could write more copy he had the ability to crank it out
8837782 as a sports writer one of his greatest attributes was he could remain objective
8837783 he was not the cheerleader for the local team he was strictly objective
8837784 i didnt like the idea of 15 writers crawling all over each other in one department
8837785 i like the smaller paper where you get to know the folks
8837786 he believes in people getting their names in the paper
8837787 the newspaper in the small town is the heart of the town
8837788 what we have is a distribution problem the only way out of this is to put more money in the hands of those consumers and have them lead us out of this
8837789 if we take it a piece at a time there are things we can do reasonably quickly
8837790 because hes part black and white to me i think he needs to get this country together black and white
8837791 if someone like me has crossed the road then theres a lot like me
8837792 its something that seems to be inherent in the boys as well as the girls they chose to marry
8837793 they were one mate oriented divorce wasnt in their vocabulary
8837794 if punishment was due we had to listen to a long lecture before being spanked by a switch that we had to cut ourselves
8837795 the switching was not nearly as bad as the lecture
8837796 when the kids graduated i told jim we have to do something
8837797 my wife can never tell me that she loves me too many times and i likewise
8837798 people learn the fishermen they know where to go when the lake is down
8837799 youve got to pay at the state park to launch your boat but its worth it not to damage your boat theres a stop and two ramps there
8837800 i went to hales ford and somebody was looking to see if they could get their boat in
8837801 he couldnt do it it was all sand there was only 2 feet of water
8837802 normally theres 6 feet of water there but i actually measured it and there was 3 feet
8837803 the engine blocks get stopped up with sand and they get hot
8837804 we have to back flush them to get all the sand out and then theyre usually all right
8837805 when youre going at 40 mph and suddenly the land comes up at 40 mph and you dont have brakes
8837806 its going to take longer to get to where youre going
8837807 for us going into the coves a lot of times we cant get into the back end
8837808 sometimes we have to park the boats on floaters and carry the rescue equipment from the floaters
8837809 its on the back side of the dock closest to shore
8837810 we have to deal with what were handed but we have great people working somehow or other well work through it
8837811 if its not going to be safe well close the docks
8837812 one year we had hurricane remnants come through and the night before the tour was to start the docks flooded
8837813 the water went down quickly but we had to close due to high water
8837814 sometimes we can get our boat out around 11 oclock but we cant get back in
8837815 weve lived here for so long and weve seen it flood and weve seen it go very dry
8837816 but all in all its a great place to live
8837817 kahn became an innovator in factory projects because he pushed the envelope
8837818 i can get a grasp of what life was like back then when detroit was thriving
8837819 the fact that you could be so singular in a space thats designed to accommodate so much bulk
8837820 i wanted to use objects that were here already and that were in abundance
8837821 pyramids have a mystical quality and an unknown connection with our unconscious
8837822 there used to be a huge beta up here underneath all the crap to your left i grew up looking at that spot its disappointing to see it now thanks to a lot of emo art fags learn some respect signed otis fbsk
8837823 there arent enough new industries coming in to replace the old
8837824 an imminent and substantial endangerment to both the public health and to the environment
8837825 thats not to say that there shouldnt be efforts made to give these sites the opportunity to have a second chance

8837830 a falta de consideraci n de atenci ns e de recursos que seguen a faltar no profesorado tam n a falta de autoestima por parte dos profesionais
8837831 a falta de est mulos cara ao alumnado e a falta de est mulos entre o profesorado
8837832 como quem o diz a um puto que caiu e se levantou a chorar com o joelho esfolado

8837836 weve had so many problems with folks sharing with us their illegally abandoned animals
8837837 its got a little bit of an aroma its not as beautiful as it should be
8837838 i understand theres fish and wildlife there so were going to keep those filled while we look into a new pump
8837839 its something i didnt think id see in my lifetime
8837840 i think if he got elected it would be a major step forward in the enlightenment of this country as a whole
8837841 im just hoping that in 2008 old fashioned bigotry is not the reason he doesnt get elected
8837842 the world doesnt look like me and my wife anymore it never did
8837843 for us to elect a barack obama is going to do more for us internationally than anything else we can do even more than electing a woman for us to elect someone with an african american background is going to speak volumes
8837844 its an extraordinary situation this transforms the whole culture of national partisan politics obama is someone who is a new democrat who in a very short period of time has taken over
8837845 i think this is a new era in american politics and these two candidates are reflecting a 21st century america less about what they are than who they are
8837846 its one of the most wonderful things at this point in american history that this nation can nominate a black person as president
8837847 you dont find that in most parts of the world that is just a tribute to the american political experience
8837848 if we dont solve this we will be a second rate nation by 2020
8837849 if you want to walk on water you got to get out of the boat
8837850 he made people comfortable and he recognized them which is the first time ive seen a superintendent do that
8837851 child abuse is going to be front and center in terms of your training and your development
8837852 we want to bring workers up to a decent wage and to give them family health care so that they dont have to make a decision between paying the rent or taking their child to a doctor
8837853 its unfortunate that we got pushed into this but we really think the contractors gave us no other choice when they didnt seriously consider our offers
8837854 we were surprised when they ended negotiations and advised us they were calling a strike
8837855 we will continue to negotiate to reach an agreement when the seiu is interested in talking
8837856 we dont have any disruptions to our operations or flights at lax and we dont intend to have any problems
8837857 they want to freeze our wages for a year but i need the money because everything keeps going up
8837858 we have to work with broken wheelchairs sometimes which is unsafe for the passengers and for us
8837859 we are here fighting for passenger safety and better pay for us
8837860 while it is not our authority to mandate a remedy we offer our encouragement and hope that both parties continue to meet a solution that serves a common good
8837861 its going to cause some chaos and confusion and its definitely going to be disruptive
8837862 this is the kind of strike thats meant to be a nuisance and exert maximum disruption to everyone involved but its difficult to say what the overall economic impact will be it just depends on how long they strike
8837863 this is an opportunity for us to explain our issues to the passengers and how it affects them
8837864 people are already angry about paying higher ticket prices and yet the service is going downhill
8837865 they shouldnt be allowed to come into the terminal and make all this noise because they are holding people up
8837866 we had a hard time getting by with the suitcases
8837867 they should be glad they even have a job right now
8837868 es la misma antes o despu s de la ley
8837869 falleci en el mes de agosto de 1936 a consecuencia de heridas producidas por hecho de guerra
8837870 para m es una cuesti n de estado no es bueno para nadie que no se sepa todo sobre la muerte del poeta

8837872 les hemos dicho que lo hacemos de manera privada sin medios de comunicaci n pero ni por esas
8837873 ich habe journalisten nie gemocht ich habe sie alle in meinen b chern sterben lassen
8837874 bei uns scheint die rolle des herausgebers oder chefredakteurs eher darin zu bestehen operativ ein mainstreaming media zu betreiben damit der allgemeine nachrichtenstrom keine aufregenden wirbel oder strudel zeigt sondern sanft und gleichf rmig abflie t ein herausgeber welche die publizistische landschaft immer mehr in eine gleichf rmige und de nachrichten pampa verwandeln m chte vollgestellt mit anzeigentafeln in der alle medien das gleiche schreiben der macht jede zeitung bedeutungslos denn nur der unterschied macht den unterschied nach dem grundlegenden gesetz aller wahrnehmung
8837875 they had broken into that second house and there was an 18 year old sleeping upstairs
8837876 they tried to hide their faces and pushed past her
8837877 we gained information that they were involved in a burglary out of playa del rey where somebody had a nanny cam catch them
8837878 het is niet aan ons te beslissen waar wenger het geld aan uitgeeft
8837879 maar als hij het nodig heeft ligt het klaar geen probleem
8837880 in principe is liverpool favoriet in onze groep maar ik denk dat atl tico net zo sterk is
8837881 eindhoven werd vorig jaar landskampioen is elk jaar aanwezig in de champions league en kan bogen op grote europese ervaring
8837882 al domnului este p m ntul i tot ce cuprinde el

8837884 recent surveys show that as many as two thirds of children up to 6 years old live in homes where the tv is on at least half the time even if no one is watching
8837885 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8837886 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8837887 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8837888 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8837889 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8837890 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8837891 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center
8837892 its the only sign weve missed all year and you only have to look for one thing
8837893 its going out there every game every win is crucial
8837894 all of a sudden you come into this scenario from where i was coming from
8837895 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8837896 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8837897 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
8837898 er hatte auch im vergangenen jahr wochen da trainierte er so berragend dass mir gar nicht anderes brig blieb als ihn zu bringen
8837899 vedad ist dann gut wenn er relativ einfach spielt und nicht versucht etwas besonderes zu machen

8837901 au ergew hnlich sich vedad daraufhin verhalten hat er empfing beide spieler mit offenen armen half insbesondere demba ba sehr viel und war ein ganz wichtiger integrationsfaktor das hat ihm die mannschaft hoch angerechnet er genie t ein hohes ansehen auch wegen seines altruistischen verhaltens

8837909 its a glorified cabin in the woods but a cabin that ive tried to make glamorous
8837910 its not another world but its certainly a different experience
8837911 this is the one place ive created in canada where i can relax entertain and be with myself alone and without the incessant noises of the city
8837912 i am always creating artistic environments for myself i go into hotel rooms and rearrange the furniture if im not comfortable im not happy and for me to be comfortable i have to be surrounded by beauty theres already too much ugliness in the world
8837913 mies van der rohe had one motto keep it simple and thats how i live

8837916 what turns me on about the house is just the peace and quiet
8837917 listen to it you can hear the fish jump in the water you can hear the birds sing in the morning for me its not just a house its the outdoors thats why the harris looks so nice on the wall it looks like it was painted here
8837918 were definitely aiming for the empty nester market either those who want to get out of town or those who are from the area and want to stay close to family and friends
8837919 these homes are all finished luxuriously with granite countertops oak staircases furniture finished cabinetry and vaulted ceilings
8837920 its important for us to see what is out there
8837921 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8837922 it ended up being a substantial increase in productivity in terms of us using the software as well as being much better for our officers in terms of not having to look at all those horrible images all the time
8837923 we use another software program and we are satisfied with it

8837925 going to be a lot of kids going to school with high hopes but they are going to be disappointed
8837926 some may have moved on in their lives and it may take time to get new people its not as simple as picking up the phone and saying well see you tuesday
8837927 principals are busy getting their schools up and running and they have to get their staffing issues planned and their hall supervision has to be worked out theyve got a lot of organizing to do to get the school set up for tuesday
8837928 king is so lovely and i wanted really to complement the location more than anything
8837929 i wanted the warmth of that lake district home because i thought it really suited king city
8837930 the classic georgian country house is a beautiful thing but its more formal than i wanted to achieve
8837931 living in it is what tells you what to do
8837932 we have dinner parties so we have a formal dining room and we think thats very important
8837933 its had quite the impact on family life when you have teenagers its really important to have everyone coming together
8837934 i grew up in those west coast houses with all the windows we have light coming in all day from somewhere

8837936 its so easy to have them organized when its properly set up
8837937 a lot of people come forward with feelings of guilt and shame but my experience generally is its not that common
8837938 it was not committed anywhere in public view and it was committed in an area with little or no public access i dont expect thered be any outside witnesses
8837939 then that stigma walks around with them when they try to access services and people think about them as criminals and dont treat them as well it snowballs
8837940 its a fascinating social commentary about how stigma can stop people from seeking help
8837941 at first it was like what are we doing walking in the middle of the street
8837942 laurie chaves 20 a student at george brown college said after strolling across with lunchtime crowds that flooded the intersection with up to 100 people at a time some filming the event with cellphone cameras
8837943 youre looking for an elmer the safety elephant to be scolding you from the side its organized chaos
8837944 it is plausible that when police are no longer here that people will cross when the red hand is flashing but that is a concern at every intersection across the city
8837945 at nighttime if theres no police here its a different corner man homeless people drunks i hate to say it but somebodys going to get hurt i hope it works but i think this is a publicity stunt for the city
8837946 its great fun its been done many other places in the world and it works there so there is no reason it shouldnt work here
8837947 that has to be in place for residents to return
8837948 we have every confidence that the occupancy permit is going to be issued and people will still be able to move in saturday

8837951 the shale production story is certainly a good news story

8837953 there is this disconnect between the two prices compared to what historically has been the case
8837954 natural gas prices are reflecting a much stronger supply picture and oil prices are reflecting a much greater degree of uncertainty and tighter fundamentals

8837956 our best fighting tool however is prevention and getting safety messages across by engaging with young people in schools local youth groups and community groups

8837958 trespassing on the track throwing things at trains and putting objects on the line are extremely dangerous and can put lives at risk
8837959 unfortunately weston super mare is one of the 10 worst towns for this type of problem in the country
8837960 if placed correctly the new fences should help to reduce the problem but making sure local young people understand the dangers is vital too

8838009 en el momento de nuestro retiro del frente amplio deberemos expresar con claridad hacia la militancia frenteamplista y de izquierda toda nuestra posici n fundacional principista transformadora profunda popular antiolig rquica y antimperialista inmediatamente incluso antes deberemos consolidar m nimamente un accionar conjunto program tico no sectario y de masas en la medida de nuestras posibilidades operativas de igual modo deberemos al tiempo que denunciemos el apartamiento del gobierno de las propuestas program ticas y el alejamiento del frente amplio de sus postulados originales marcar con claridad nuestra estrategia signada por los intereses de los m s infelices

8838044 immediately following i verbally did the same for my interpreter and the other injured civilian
8838045 the day this the ambush happened to tom was one of the worst in my military career
8838046 we didnt know what his condition was or any of the details
8838047 we just couldnt get back to the operating base fast enough
8838048 we were upset with the situation but we had to use the anger and frustration to charge us up to continue the mission
8838049 i learned early in life through special forces to be a survivor
8838050 to be a survivor you plan and train to deal with the unexpected as a result nothing is a surprise
8838051 they cannot feel sorry for themselves for thinking their lives will never be what they expected
8838052 i tell them their lives were never going to be what they expected they simply had not lived long enough to realize it yet
8838053 not to take anything away from blood family but soldiers who go to war together are family
8838054 day to day temps have been fluctuating far more than usual
8838055 the swings make me a little nervous particularly when temps soar to 116 as we saw recently when temps get that high vines can shut down putting the grapes in danger fortunately our grapes are all doing great
8838056 this is the time of year when we visit the vineyards several times a day to see when they start to get their color when the first hints of purple appear on the grapes we know that harvest is right around the corner right now i am ordering all of my harvest supplies and getting my team ready to pick sort and rush the grapes to the winery
8838057 well thats a big question but ill boil it down in simple terms because of the hotter temperatures paso wines tend to be more deeply extracted and big the higher temps lead to higher sugars which in turn lead to higher alcohol when making my wines i strive to deliver big and bold flavors but also wines that hold up when paired with food some of my wines are meant to solo imbibing to be sure but the lexicon that you are enjoying is a great food wine bright acidity and deep fruit dont overpower and are perfect with lighter foods or even hearty entrees
8838058 a man accustomed to american food and american domestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in europe but i think he would gradually waste away and eventually die
8838059 american cooking suffers from american nervousness exactly as american nerves are suffering from american cookery
8838060 americans are just beginning to regard food the way the french always have dinner is not what you do in the evening before something else dinner is the evening
8838061 americans will eat garbage provided you sprinkle it liberally with ketchup

8838063 we all have hometown appetites every other person is a bundle of longing for the simplicities of good taste once enjoyed on the farm or in the hometown he or she left behind
8838064 if youve spent all your meat stamps and havent any more eating chicken is a pleasant way to help to win the war
8838065 announcement that the office of price administration has suspended the point rationing system for all kinds of meat with the exception of choice cuts and roast of beef brings to an end one of the least glorious battles on the home front the battle of the butcher shop in a world which was visibly tottering under the weight of an atrocious assault on free institutions a world in which whole races were being systematically exterminated and in which whole innocent and unoffending nations had been overrun and starved the self appointed spokesmen the american people acted as though the worst atrocity of all time was a system which limited their right to buy as much meat as they chose and at as high prices as they could afford
8838066 and now the good news in the 1980s the united states will emerge as a major world power in a new field gastronomy the ingredients necessary for this to happen are three knowledgeable and adventuresome cooks consumers who recognize quality and are willing to pay for it and access to superior foodstuffs all are available and in increasing quantities

8838104 recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that a single genetic event in the map kinase signaling pathway may be sufficient for thyroid cell transformation and tumor development
8838105 thyroid cancer is associated with exposure to external or internal ionizing radiation elucidation of mechanisms of radiation induced cancer in humans especially early steps and pathways has potential implications for epidemiological risk analyses early clinical diagnosis and chemopreventive interventions
8838106 that means that a younger person living close to the bombing site would be more likely to have adult onset thyroid cancer having ret ptc rearrangements
8838107 it could be either by direct dna damage or by other pathways such as a result of radiation induced genomic instability
8838108 that took you a week to make that is so sad

8838110 what happens is that people pull back on consumption of unimportant things like in our case suitcases
8838111 we stock shoes which are considered as a necessity but even they are affected
8838112 eighty percent of spaniards are home owners and 97 of mortgages are variable rate mortgages so where people were previously paying 500 euros 402 a month that rate could go up to 1000 euros
8838113 basically every person has less money to spend on luxury items such as lunches and taxis and that affects the economy all in all
8838114 what is worrying is that the problems are spreading quickly because of a lack of confidence
8838115 we havent fallen into negative growth rates yet but we will have a recession and its coming very quickly

8838117 if you have a friend whos being abused the first thing that you should probably do is let them know that they dont deserve to be treated that way
8838118 everybody deserves to be treated with respect and that there is help available
8838119 if you dont know the person but you hear lets say arguing screaming yelling going on first you need to decide is this the first time that youve ever heard it
8838120 because lots of couples argue once in a while but if it sounds like things are getting out of hand or you hear it often then this is a pattern of behavior domestic violence is a pattern its not just a one time incident so if it sounds like someone is going to be harmed call the police
8838121 never approach who you think the abuser is because thats just dangerous
8838122 if you can approach the victim at some point when she is alone and basically let her know there is help available let her know that youre concerned for her safety and tell her what you think you hear going on and let her know about the programs at the ywca
8838123 one of the major programs here at the ywca is the domestic violence program and there is safety available for them if they need a safe place to go to
8838124 there are programs such as our womens support group and legal advocacy
8838125 the brick walls are not there to keep us out the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something because the brick walls are there to stop the people who dont want it badly enough theyre there to stop the other people
8838126 its not about how to achieve your dreams its about how to lead your life

8838141 in politics each of us has a reputation and obviously mr peters is very keen as any of us would be to defend his reputation and he will be offering total cooperation to the serious fraud office
8838142 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address their matters expeditiously
8838143 mr peters is offering his total cooperation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers including peter williams qc and the office will take place tomorrow morning
8838144 mr peters has been thinking very carefully about this its been clear to me this would be the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about this at all its accepted this is totally proper and there are precedents for it
8838145 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it
8838146 as someone who has been in politics a long time i know how precious a reputation is and how hurt people get when theres a serious assault on their reputation
8838147 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8838148 why would they never ever come and talk to me if they had an intention of coming to talk to me
8838149 kangaroo court of public opinion organised by the media in this country and others
8838150 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8838151 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8838152 their clothes had been sent for washing and there was no spare set in any case what difference did it make whether or not these mad people were clothed
8838153 i was sitting next to two uc davis students who were 20 and they were delegates
8838154 if they have to campaign and caucus to win they have to be ebullient if that means dynamic if that means attractive so be it theyre not nerdy
8838155 i lost to an older gentleman who took off two months from work
8838156 its a lot harder to get into these things than in boston in 2004
8838157 you needed to call someone inside and tell them to come out and get you
8838158 im on the floor texting them ive sent 3 000 text messages over the last four days
8838159 they want to play super nintendo and watch sports and hit on hot chicks but if you get them involved then they vote correctly
8838160 along with the economic and social development of this region the neighbouring areas too would be benefited in view of the high number of the unemployed youth we are duty bound to improve their lot the immense economic prospects opened up by the township would enable the youth to join in this endavour and they would be able to earn at least rs 5000 to 6000 on a monthly basis and that too on a long term basis however the whole process has been slowed down due to the unwillingness of the farmers to give the required land

8838166 our strategy is to provide communications solutions that are as flexible as possible and have a wider appeal in the market than similar competing products
8838167 the idea is to make toshiba systems easier for our channel to sell
8838168 we believe that much of the demand for voip comes from the additional functionality that can be gained by using voip technology
8838169 consistently request that we provide a cost effective migration path to upgrade to newer products which is why our systems accommodate connection of digital telephones
8838170 we want to make sure the channel tells customers that they can use digital telephones for some of their local users and offload some of the unnecessary voice traffic from the lan
8838171 when we are up against other products toshiba is more flexible
8838172 if we dont want to lead with a more expensive ip handset we can go digital at a lower cost to the customer we see that as a big advantage in selling because we dont get priced out that way
8838173 we wanted to do a fake documentary about the making of the movie within the movie which is called tropic thunder not the actual movie tropic thunder the fake documentary focuses on the real movies fake director and what happens to the fake cast before they go into the real jungle its pretty straightforward
8838174 original material for web consumption is a growing area for us and rain of madness dovetails perfectly with the theatrical release of tropic thunder

8838182 well this is mission impossible mr hunt difficult should be a walk in the park
8838183 it will be interesting to hear from the prosecutor when he will be able to have this new indictment
8838184 in terms of finding out about the beginning of the trial that will be vital
8838185 the value of a possible deal will not be greater than two billion dollars
8838186 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8838187 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8838188 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8838189 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around
8838190 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8838191 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the
8838192 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8838193 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8838194 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8838195 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8838196 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8838197 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8838198 mitch tenneys reputation preceded him he was a miracle worker in surgical scrubs a hunk and a half with riveting blue eyes and a really bad attitude the dazzling doctor had offended one official too many and was now this close to being fired unless samantha ryan could set him straight with sams disposition and powers of persuasion she was sure she could get dr mitch back on track but somehow the brooding bachelor got to her instead body and soul now sam had a baby on the way with a man who had no interest in playing house what was a good girl to do

8838201 it was just my quick translantion running away with me
8838202 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8838203 the suspension of operations is a result of the exceptionally difficult trading conditions which have affected all airlines over the last 12 months we have worked hard over the last seven years to build up a successful business but have incurred losses in the current year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8838204 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings
8838205 we dont really understand how cool they think we are i actually made some friend with little fourth and fifth graders and theyre just the cutest little guys ever
8838206 they got us up at 7 00 or 8 00 a m and we would go down and eat five star meals at every beautiful hotel you can think of because we stayed top rated hotels in queensland and tasmania

8838228 por fin podemos ponernos todos a trabajar en la direcci n que ya marc el bng para paliar los efectos de la crisis en nuestro pa s
8838229 que es lo que los ciudadanos demandan a su gobierno
8838230 una cuesti n interna del psoe que ellos explicar n a los ciudadanos
8838231 el psoe deber a dar explicaciones de por qu traslad a la sociedad un debate electoral interno que cre incertidumbre justo en el momento en que galicia menos lo necesita
8838232 el bng se ha manifestado en reiteradas ocasiones a favor de que se agote la legislatura dado que no hay ninguna raz n que justificase la disoluci n del parlamento y la convocatoria anticipada de las elecciones
8838233 el gobierno gallego cuenta con estabilidad pol tica y con una mayor a parlamentaria s lida

8838253 what did you want to be when you were growing up
8838254 i have done all that i can do to get the job
8838255 i expect to end up with a job that i love
8838256 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8838257 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8838258 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8838259 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
8838260 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
8838261 listen to the guy thats been on the mountain top and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
8838262 we were surprised at the amount of data usage that it was that low
8838263 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8838264 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8838265 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8838266 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major a major consumer issue
8838267 its nonsense they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8838268 when it launches for the first time into the frigid canadian waters the diefenbreaker as it is almost certain to be nicknamed will be a crowning achievement for our country
8838269 the true north is our destiny for our explorers for our entrepreneurs for our artists and to not embrace its promise now at the dawn of its ascendancy would be to turn our backs on what it is to be canadian
8838270 prime minister harper is no longer a newcomer in the arctic hes got his head around some fundamental inuit issues after making four trips to the arctic so we are now able to talk to him in detail about our issues and more importantly how they are all interconnected
8838271 i can say at least for us in the yukon its quite comforting that we now have a government that actually has a vision for the north
8838272 if mr dion thinks his carbon tax idea is going to help save the environment in the arctic he needs professional assistance
8838273 friends i hope in the not so distant future to return and to see the long dreamed of beaufort mackenzie valley gas development finally come to fruition and to see our northern frontier opened as it has never been before
8838274 if the prime minister was truly concerned with protecting arctic sovereignty his top priority would be addressing the climate crisis and stopping the rapid loss of ice at the poles
8838275 but instead mr harper is allowing emissions to rise and plans to let big oil and gas companies drill in the melting north the arctic is our common heritage and drilling for oil in this fragile environment is unacceptable
8838276 mr harpers simplistic strategy of flexing military muscles and exploiting arctic resources

8838278 these are carrefours best first half results since 2005 this strong performance attests to the relevance of our multi format single brand strategy on an international scale the group has robust fundamentals with a business model focused primarily on food a balanced portfolio of formats leading positions in the countries where it operates and a sound balance sheet these strengths along with our competitive advantages such as the power of our brand and our real estate potential give us the means to forge ahead and create greater value in an uncertain and challenging environment the implementation of the operational action plan we announced in july makes me confident that we will achieve our 2008 objectives
8838279 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush estuvo en lo cierto el 90 por ciento de las veces

8838287 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8838288 the system has to protect the citizens of baltimore and when it fails like this and you get a brand new victim for sure the citizens were not protected
8838289 its frustrating to police officers who did the hard work to get this guy charged
8838290 youve got to understand youre asking a judge to make a decision on somebodys liberty based on skeletal allegations
8838291 if detectives are convinced this is the guy and want to keep him off the streets youve just got to give us more
8838292 ensure that judge braverman understands his obligation to protect the citizens of baltimore city from violent criminals before he is allowed to conduct further reviews
8838293 judges have very broad discretion in determining bail and because it is a pending case it would be inappropriate to comment
8838294 if an individual is held on no bail they live at baltimore city jail until their trial which in many cases can be more than a year and during that time the person has no liberty the person is in jail and has to wait for a jury to vindicate them
8838295 its not a good thing for the judiciary to abdicate its responsibility under law to look at the nature of the evidence against a defendant just because the state says this is a first degree murder case

8838306 i was on the zoom flight from halifax in canada to london gatwick this morning the flight had already been delayed and then cancelled yesterday evening we were rescheduled for this morning
8838307 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half we were then told we all had to disembark again the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8838308 the crew had presumably just been told that not only had they lost their jobs but that they had to find their own way back to the uk
8838309 i was impressed by the composure professionalism and the helpfulness of the zoom crew and the airport staff meanwhile i am still in halifax and have to take three flights tomorrow to get back home
8838310 we were initially told the plane was delayed because of technical problems

8838312 some people here are very angry and there seems to be a complete lack of information

8838314 we arrived at calgary airport at 4pm wednesday but were not allowed to check in for our glasgow flight due to a technical problem
8838315 ninety minutes later we were told that the aircraft was unserviceable and that the earliest we could fly out was saturday 30 august we were meant to be in work friday
8838316 we were informed that there would be no compensation or help with accommodation or subsistence
8838317 this morning we learned that the company has gone bankrupt and so at the moment we are still in canada unsure of when we are going home
8838318 luckily we are with a travel company who are doing their best to sort us out with a flight home
8838319 i had literally booked a flight to canada for christmas yesterday
8838320 now i have to wait 12 weeks for the credit card company to refund the fare because thats how long their dispute process takes
8838321 in the meantime im out of pocket for the 1 000 a replacement flight is going to cost and not so much as an automated e mail from zoom bad form
8838322 we had to wait an hour and a half to get to the desk and when we got there they said the flight had been delayed 12 hours
8838323 we asked why and they said they didnt know even the information desk for zoom couldnt tell us anything so weve been left in the dark
8838324 we were looking forward to this holiday for ages i cant feel any worse than i feel now
8838325 there are 10 of us hoping zoom continue to operate five band members one manager and four fans going to belfast to play at and observe the open house festival on 22 september
8838326 i was due to fly tomorrow so they basically let me know 18 hours before and i guess everybody else as well so at the moment ive got flights tomorrow morning out of new york on a different airline back into london so i should still get in on saturday

8838478 i think it sends a message and a statement of what we are about
8838479 i think people now understand that actually man city is a place that is an interesting thought for many people at the moment
8838480 players want to come and join us they can see the ambition that we have and where we want to go
8838481 we have the means to attract top quality players which shaun obviously is there arent many days left in the window and hopefully well be able to attract more before it closes
8838482 all i know is that park chu young attended training and there is a big chance that he will play at the weekend
8838483 we are in the hat which is great it is another two legged affair but it would be great to get through to the group stages
8838484 it would be great if we can sustain the progress we have made in the premier league
8838485 that is so important but why not do well in europe as well
8838486 if we could get a couple more people in before the transfer window closes on monday and we are trying everything to do that it would give all of us a lift and maybe sustain us for the months ahead
8838487 i have to emphasise again how delighted i am that gareth is staying i am ecstatic but so is the dressing room
8838488 it is a big lift for us it feels like we have a new player a few weeks ago i thought gareth would have gone by now
8838489 it was a question of getting the job done i was hoping we would sustain the tempo of the game longer than we did
8838490 but having scored four goals in iceland and having made a few changes im just so pleased to have got through
8838491 after that game the dressing room was a horrible place to be no words were said and club wise its the worst ive ever been in
8838492 we realised that with the other teams who were left in the competition we would have had a great chance to win the fa cup it was really disappointing
8838493 the important thing was to keep that feeling at the back of your mind and make sure we went on to win the premier league and champions league
8838494 winning the double was a great achievement but were not satisfied with that
8838495 its something we all spoke about when we came back in pre season we want more trophies we dont want to be known as a team which won the double and that was it we want to make history
8838496 if there is a moment in my career where i regret a decision it was clearly the day after the fa cup final when my agent told me club x want you tomorrow and i told him no i love it here and i dont want to go i want to stay
8838497 thats the moment i regret after that day after that final i should have left chelsea and i would have the chance in wembley to say goodbye to the fans and to say goodbye to english football so thats a moment i regret because the next season lasted only a couple of months
8838498 i only have friends in chelsea and i have problems with nobody but if i stayed there one two three four more weeks probably in this moment i wouldnt say this
8838499 i love that club im in the history of that club and i left the club in the right moment to feel like that and to say that honestly
8838500 i think peter storrie pompey chief executive has made him an offer of a short term contract but i dont know where he is at with that
8838501 he has had a bad knee but if thats all right hes a good player
8838502 if you ask me though i do get the feeling it is not going to happen
8838503 but i saw him play against chelsea two or three years ago for barcelona and he was fantastic that night in the middle of the park
8838504 i dont know for sure who i can get but we need some the only way i can buy is if i sell two or three who i am willing to let go but they dont seem keen on moving
8838505 i still have a good squad and we will still be back up there this season mid table or above is still the aim

8838547 atlas shrugged depicts a grim world without wonderful things in it whereas obama is talking about the notion that americans are bonded by a common cause

8838571 thats what hell will be like small chat to the babbling of lethe about the good old days when we ate cereal without the milk and wished we were dead
8838572 but if you feel that way dont you think its kind of douche y to make money on her fame
8838573 the land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good if the lord is pleased with us he will lead us into that land a land flowing with milk and honey and will give it to us only do not rebel against the lord and do not be afraid of the people of the land because we will swallow them up their protection is gone but the lord is with us do not be afraid of them
8838574 the writer of fiction just makes ordinary life a little bit more interesting for the rest of us
8838575 for eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8838576 my mom said to slow down i told her thats how you drive and u got ur music turned up
8838577 no estic malalta deia estic trencada per s c feli de ser viva mentre pugui pintar
8838578 have you ever been in love horrible isnt it it makes you so vulnerable it opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up you build up all these defenses you build up a whole suit of armor suit of armor so that nothing can hurt you then one stupid person no different from any other stupid person wanders into your stupid life you give them a piece of you they didnt ask for it they did something dumb one day like smile at you and then your life isnt your own anymore love takes hostages it gets inside you it eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness so simple a phrase like maybe we should be just friends turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart it hurts not just in the imagination not just in the mind its a soul hurt a real gets inside you and rips you apart pain i hate love
8838579 not to worry about what we are going to eat or what we are going to wear
8838580 oh gods the cake cutting that only happens once what do i remember from my photographer days and talking to photographers who did weddings and what they said because oh gods is that one sd card going to be enough ive got three back up batteries this is good is 400 pictures going to be enough to sift through and oh gods how do i transfer photoshop edits for print and and
8838581 the refugees should have the right of return to their homeland and we are negotiating this with the israelis i have to say we are not with permanent settlement of palestinian refugees in lebanon we are against permanent resettlement
8838582 the camps in lebanon are part of the lebanese territories and part of the lebanese governments responsibility regarding security and non security matters
8838583 we are ready to cooperate by all means because we do not see ourselves as being in charge of security inside the camps
8838584 now in a sign of the times the company is offering deeper discounts adding lower priced store brands and emphasizing value in its advertising it is even inviting customers to show up for budget focused store tours like those led by mr hebb a whole foods employee
8838585 our family still buys and grows all organic fruit produce and organic milk
8838586 however where i used to purchase only organic grab and go snacks and breakfast cereals now i am buying store brand snacks and cereals that are still free of msg and high fructose corn syrup but are by no means organic
8838587 we have also started to grow some food at home like greens peas berries and tomatoes and we shop at the farmers market as the fresh veggies last longer than store bought items
8838588 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8838589 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8838590 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8838591 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit cards bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8838592 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8838593 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8838594 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans
8838595 how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8838596 barack obama opened the final phase of the 2008 presidential election by unveiling an unabashedly populist progressive agenda to renew americas promise in the 21st century
8838597 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8838598 that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8838599 to own their failure its time for us to change america and thats why im running for president of the united states
8838600 i dont care what jesse jackson does im going to this convention and im going to win
8838601 and your name okay nikol what do you need to see him for today
8838602 contraception birth control it is urgent that i see him today
8838603 sorry nikol we dont have openings for that purpose today i can get you in to see him in oh two weeks
8838604 id be happy to do that but for right now i need to know if he can call in a prescription for plan b for me
8838605 ohhh oh oh well then i will get this message to him right away yes right away
8838606 do you need to know which pharmacy to call and the best number to reach me at and should we go ahead and schedule that follow up so i dont have to bother you with this call again
8838607 i dont care what jesse jackson does im going to this convention and im going to win
8838608 we are only targeting the main cup and nothing else there are one or two other teams that can challenge us but we ready
8838609 i hope the technical committee rescinds the decision and put the semis on friday today the boys have to go to church on saturday because faith comes first
8838610 he is doing fine he is undergoing some checkups the doctors have told us that absolutely there is no cause for concern
8838611 klein had been moving in and i hoped to trap him in a big pot
8838612 while it was possible steve had a big pair i knew he was an advanced player and it was possible he was trying to pick up the pot with a squeeze play
8838613 leading out here would have likely caused steve to fold overcards but if he had a real hand hed probably raise and put me in a tough spot
8838614 a check raise would be a much scarier scenario for steve so i decided to go for it
8838615 the way the hand came down pre flop i figured he had to know this flop was right in my wheelhouse
8838616 my flat calling both kleins raise and steves re raise cried out middle pair or middle connectors i knew he couldnt call my all in with overcards and that there was a decent chance hed suspect a set and lay down a strong hand like an overpair i call this the threat of the set
8838617 when a player makes a big move against a players strong pre flop raise his opponent must consider that hes up against a set it can be a good bluffing opportunity

8838625 i was on the zoom flight from halifax in canada to london gatwick this morning the flight had already been delayed and then cancelled yesterday evening we were rescheduled for this morning
8838626 we had boarded the flight and sat for an hour and a half we were then told we all had to disembark again the pilot was left to tell all the passengers that there would no longer be a flight and the reasons for this
8838627 the crew had presumably just been told that not only had they lost their jobs but that they had to find their own way back to the uk
8838628 i was impressed by the composure professionalism and the helpfulness of the zoom crew and the airport staff meanwhile i am still in halifax and have to take three flights tomorrow to get back home
8838629 we were initially told the plane was delayed because of technical problems
8838630 after that we heard it was something to do with payment problems
8838631 some people here are very angry and there seems to be a complete lack of information
8838632 its quite frustrating knowing that the plane is on the tarmac but that we cant get on it
8838633 we arrived at calgary airport at 4pm wednesday but were not allowed to check in for our glasgow flight due to a technical problem
8838634 ninety minutes later we were told that the aircraft was unserviceable and that the earliest we could fly out was saturday 30 august we were meant to be in work friday
8838635 we were informed that there would be no compensation or help with accommodation or subsistence
8838636 this morning we learned that the company has gone bankrupt and so at the moment we are still in canada unsure of when we are going home
8838637 luckily we are with a travel company who are doing their best to sort us out with a flight home
8838638 i had literally booked a flight to canada for christmas yesterday
8838639 now i have to wait 12 weeks for the credit card company to refund the fare because thats how long their dispute process takes
8838640 in the meantime im out of pocket for the 1 000 a replacement flight is going to cost and not so much as an automated e mail from zoom bad form
8838641 we had to wait an hour and a half to get to the desk and when we got there they said the flight had been delayed 12 hours
8838642 we asked why and they said they didnt know even the information desk for zoom couldnt tell us anything so weve been left in the dark
8838643 we were looking forward to this holiday for ages i cant feel any worse than i feel now
8838644 there are 10 of us hoping zoom continue to operate five band members one manager and four fans going to belfast to play at and observe the open house festival on 22 september
8838645 i was due to fly tomorrow so they basically let me know 18 hours before and i guess everybody else as well so at the moment ive got flights tomorrow morning out of new york on a different airline back into london so i should still get in on saturday
8838646 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes
8838647 theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8838648 for while sen mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8838649 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8838650 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell
8838651 but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8838652 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8838653 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8838654 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8838655 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8838656 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8838657 dad can you tell me what a purple gurpie is
8838658 you are not my son and youre not welcome in this house pack up and get out
8838659 sorry laddie i dont know nuthin about that but you see that guy over there
8838660 i wish the hillary we saw at the dnc was the hillary during the primary
8838661 what was it like when you watched obama make his speech
8838662 but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8838663 father if you are willing please take this cup of suffering away from me yet i want your will to be done not mine
8838664 how could the teachers know our child was ill and not tell the people who were in the best position to care for her if we had known we could have done something
8838665 c vero progresso solo quando i vantaggi di una nuova tecnologia diventano per tutti
8838666 anything can happen said baskett whos expected to play a bigger role than in the past at least at the start of the season in andy reids west coast offense
8838667 but that first year i didnt know what to expect i definitely didnt want to pick up the phone its still the same this year
8838668 in this league the more you can do the better
8838669 the more ways a coach can use you the more value you have to the team
8838670 i thought it was a touchdown said baskett whose joy turned to dismay when the call was overturned and the patriots took possession at their 20
8838671 i knew id lost the ball but i thought id crossed the plane and everything you sit there looking at it the replay it looks so close i guess it could go either way and it went the other way
8838672 thank goodness its preseason but coaches appreciated the effort they said next time make sure its not so close
8838673 we flew them in and put them up in a hotel
8838674 it was well worth it just to see them get to interact with the people where i grew up
8838675 i was able to take them out to the middle of nowhere
8838676 they all enjoyed the people and had a great time out there
8838677 it was great said donovan before beginning to tease his buddy
8838678 if youre ever flying to clovis it mustve been a mistake but we had a lot of fun hank is a legend out there in clovis a lot of us who participated in his golf tournament and basketball game had a great time
8838679 ill do it again next year thats my teammate i like to support my teammates
8838680 the citizen tips have continued to come in throughout the last 24 hours and law enforcement are taking those tips very seriously and continue to follow up on them
8838681 i heard my name is jonas on the radio and it made me think of you
8838682 and your name okay nikol what do you need to see him for today
8838683 contraception birth control it is urgent that i see him today
8838684 sorry nikol we dont have openings for that purpose today i can get you in to see him in oh two weeks
8838685 id be happy to do that but for right now i need to know if he can call in a prescription for plan b for me
8838686 ohhh oh oh well then i will get this message to him right away yes right away
8838687 do you need to know which pharmacy to call and the best number to reach me at and should we go ahead and schedule that follow up so i dont have to bother you with this call again
8838688 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8838689 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8838690 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8838691 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8838692 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8838693 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8838694 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8838695 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8838696 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8838697 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8838698 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8838699 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8838700 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8838701 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8838702 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8838703 for what its worth im sorry for what i said
8838704 well if i liked it i wouldnt tell you not to would i
8838705 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8838706 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
8838707 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
8838708 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
8838709 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington

8838716 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8838717 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8838718 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8838719 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado asegur

8838746 the grand old party is no longer grand its just old
8838747 another great band out of brooklyn the epochs are making music that sounds like what justin timberlake would be doing if he had skipped his mickey mouse club and boy band origins and simply focussed on creating catchy falsetto driven pop songs opposite sides is a gorgeous rambling track that seems to head out in five different rhythmic and thematic directions over the course of its 4 minute span jumping between fuzz box dance beats quiet psychedelic digressions and sweet ethereal harmonies

8838756 denver with the candidate she wanted but reportedly without her eyelashes
8838757 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8838758 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8838759 the number speaks for itself indian students have a high visa compliance rate and they are a very important part of the australias 12 5 billion us 11 billion education export industry
8838760 as many as 47 639 student visas were granted to indian nationals during 2007 08 and 5 772 went on to get permanent residence visas
8838761 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8838762 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8838763 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8838764 we knew that she was going to look to score more
8838765 once she gets going its hard to stop the bleeding we didnt come with the energy and the effort that we had before the olympic break this was one of the biggest challenges after a break like that you still have to come out and be ready to play
8838766 with a player like that it has to be a team effort and she was definitely a focus for us we did a good job on her and had everyone else beat us
8838767 we did some things out there that we didnt even talk about
8838768 it was great instinctual play by our players we really made it tough for tina thompson inside there were times when we had four people in the paint when they were trying to isolate her they forced it in and we got some turnovers
8838769 on the olympic team you dont have to be so aggressive offensively itll come
8838770 whoever got it got it i obviously didnt get it as much as the others but that was cool i played my role
8838771 i dont think i played any different than i have all season ive just got to stay aggressive
8838772 weve been working hard the whole break and we had high expectations were going to continue to play as hard as we did tonight to win
8838773 but i also know what the doctors are saying and they have a lot more history shell come back and itll be great to have her back shell rehab here and well just see what happens
8838774 weve talked about tanisha all year long and referred to her being a starter camille the way shes played here in that starting role before the break and the way shes played in practice we feel comfortable with her starting
8838775 swin is a starter for us and shes going to play quite a bit for us were going to work to get her caught up itll be game by game and itll all fall into place

8838810 a 52 year old port hedland man was conducting maintenance work on a scissor lift at port hedland when it fell on him at 1300 aest on tuesday a police spokeswoman said
8838811 the fatalities are difficult to talk about without getting emotional the event that really shook us was that we had a helicopter crash where basically a pilot flew a helicopter into terrain and we had five fatalities that was a truly tragic event and would be the single biggest event that weve had
8838812 i think historically we probably have reduced our fatality rates over time it varies certainly from year to year but unfortunately we still have multiple fatalities every year in this business which is something that weve got to continue to work on

8838880 oxfam believes that the focus on adaptation helping people adapt to the impacts of climate change is the number one priority for the pacific
8838881 the need is urgent within the pacific region people living in low lying islands and river deltas are already experiencing the negative results of climate change including rising seas and salt water inundation
8838882 this contributes to crop losses destruction of fresh water sources and flooding the nation of kiribati faces the prospect of disappearing completely as do other low lying islands in the pacific including tuvalu the marshall islands and the coast regions of papua new guinea
8838883 it is the poor who are most at risk and will suffer most from climate change poor people are already bearing the brunt of the impacts of climate change in our region through more frequent droughts floods and severe weather events
8838884 the injustice at the heart of climate change is that poor people in developing countries are the least responsible for causing climate change however are the most affected
8838885 climate change is borderless it is happening and everyone is affected
8838886 australia has the responsibility to act and the capacity to do so australia as one of the biggest carbon emitters per person in the world and an important neighbour in the pacific region has a greater responsibility for addressing the problem

8839095 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico

8839158 students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors found the courage to keep it alive
8839159 the failure to respond is a direct result of the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8839167 in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8839168 this is not the time to play politics on the issue i know this is the year of central elections therefore people are out to make comments for political reasons
8839169 although i am 100 percent indonesian im very proud of the games
8839170 after all i share the same blood with those people the same culture
8839171 after the may 1998 riots there was an increased awareness of chinese identity as a result they started to join political parties or ngos they have become more assertive defending their rights before the reforms there were hardly any chinese indonesian politician to speak off now far more are getting involved
8839172 its the young generations responsibility to revive our culture otherwise itll disappear
8839173 we have a lot to learn from china thirty years ago it was as poor as we were
8839174 they have to accept that if we want to build a nation we have to shed all cultural differences and become truly indonesian
8839175 even though my blood is chinese i am born here i live here so i wish for indonesia to win
8839176 no one waved to our athletes when they paraded what a shame
8839177 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8839178 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen
8839179 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8839180 to become a kind of mantra for democratic critiques of the republican convention next week
8839181 it was a more traditional liberal democratic speech than obama normally gives
8839182 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth

8839189 todos los convenios de la oit sin excepci n no admiten ninguna reserva o declaraci n interpretativa
8839190 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8839191 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
8839192 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8839193 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8839194 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8839195 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8839196 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8839197 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8839198 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8839199 presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
8839200 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
8839201 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8839202 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8839203 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8839204 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8839205 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
8839206 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
8839207 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
8839208 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
8839209 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
8839210 king was the first black man who was able to rally a large number of people together just like obama is and the message is still the same change
8839211 no longer being dependent on the middle east for oil within the next ten years
8839212 well that is selfish joe i still have old age and social security to worry about i am left to worry about what is happening to the future of medicare and prescription drug costs i have about 45 years left to worry if i will be able to afford nursing homes walkers home blood pressure monitors support hose copays hospital visits and surgeries someday
8839213 so what if you didnt have a healthy snack make it a healthy dinner
8839214 some system by our government is going to take care of us
8839215 in a sense weve come to our nations capital to cash a check when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir this note was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
8839216 give san francisco state credit they came after us and defended hard the whole game
8839217 we didnt panic we stayed with the gameplan and got more and more chances im glad we scored in the last 12 minutes it shows us that if we stay disciplined and stick with things it will pay off
8839218 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them
8839219 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8839220 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it
8839221 we chose that location because its central its easily accessible its highly visible
8839222 we still believe its the best permanent home for the clock but inevitably when you put anything a piece of sculpture a countdown clock in a public place you take a certain amount of risk so the best you can do is manage that
8839223 day to day temps have been fluctuating far more than usual
8839224 the swings make me a little nervous particularly when temps soar to 116 as we saw recently when temps get that high vines can shut down putting the grapes in danger fortunately our grapes are all doing great
8839225 this is the time of year when we visit the vineyards several times a day to see when they start to get their color when the first hints of purple appear on the grapes we know that harvest is right around the corner right now i am ordering all of my harvest supplies and getting my team ready to pick sort and rush the grapes to the winery
8839226 well thats a big question but ill boil it down in simple terms because of the hotter temperatures paso wines tend to be more deeply extracted and big the higher temps lead to higher sugars which in turn lead to higher alcohol when making my wines i strive to deliver big and bold flavors but also wines that hold up when paired with food some of my wines are meant to solo imbibing to be sure but the lexicon that you are enjoying is a great food wine bright acidity and deep fruit dont overpower and are perfect with lighter foods or even hearty entrees

8839231 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
8839232 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
8839233 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
8839234 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8839235 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8839246 our company has been caught between investor flight caused by the collapse of finance companies and other investment funds and the bottom dropping out of the property development market
8839247 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding national media marketing i look to the studies and conclusions of ritterbush wagoner who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
8839248 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
8839249 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
8839250 they breezed in one sunday afternoon wide eyed and cheerful both must have been in their late 70s or early 80s i watched as they casually walked the floor browsing and whispering to one another the one thing that immediately struck me was that they were holding each others hands i remember thinking about how lucky it must be to get to that stage of life and not only be with someone you love but also want to hold their hand
8839251 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8839252 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8839253 mr blanchette told me that there was a lot of gossip around the city gym that mr rivkin and gordon were he used the term faggots
8839254 he had quite strong feelings for your daughter didnt he
8839255 certainly without a shadow of doubt chosen the same method her mother had used
8839256 she certainly would not have well its as ive said
8839257 theres no evidence to support anyone else being involved in the death but theres suspicion
8839258 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8839259 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8839260 amyloid beta measurements in the brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well the cells are communicating with each other
8839261 we actually had a couple of late withdrawals and benny is an old experienced footballer so weve basically bought him along to give us a bit of experience and i guess effectively trial him for one of those overseas positions
8839262 se decreta fijar la fecha del referendo nacional constituyente dirimitorio y aprobatorio para el 7 de diciembre de 2008
8839263 the landslides occurred suddenly while people were sleeping after it had been raining for days
8839264 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8839265 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8839266 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8839267 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008
8839268 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban
8839269 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8839270 all jason needs to be clear of is if we can get the shoulder back in the pain aspect of it afterwards and is he able to continue to perform if the answer is yes then lets continue to play with it knowing that it could come out
8839271 unless theres something unusual about the next dislocation that he gets hell keep playing but if thats the case then all bets will be off
8839272 at the moment well continue to push on under those conditions
8839273 depending what we do with ruckman kurt tippett and whether we play him up forward as well as in the ruck we could end up with four midfielders on the bench at some stage in the game
8839274 if you lose one youve still got some artillery there to continue on
8839275 it always makes it difficult when you start losing people out of the game that cant come back on in particular midfielders but weve been through it before
8839276 we werent able to cover it against collingwood in round 15 and if we didnt get porplyzia and brett burton injured we dont know what the result wouldve been
8839277 there have been some other games this year where we have lost people and still got the result
8839278 porplyzia has earned a lot of respect the way he plays footy full stop hes improved year by year hes taken his game to another level this year and hes one of the key players in the competition theres no doubt about that
8839279 it would be silly not to use that sort of emotion for our benefit in this game
8839280 those three guys have been outstanding for this club and it would be sad to see them come off the field for the last time we have to make sure we play well and bring a bit happiness to the occasion as well
8839281 in saying that i had a good run and i was pretty lucky
8839282 hopefully thats done now and im on the field more often than not
8839283 they along with canberra are sides who can put tries on you from anywhere
8839284 coming from their own end they can split you open pretty easily
8839285 you cant hide from the fact that its an emotional game
8839286 the huizhou project will further increase the energy supply in the pearl river delta in guangdong one of chinas economic powerhouses
8839287 i dont know what went on in there it was a pretty rowdy day
8839288 i think the speakers handling of the situation was pretty poor i dont know why i was bounced
8839289 i dont know why i was picked on when the ministers were getting away with murder
8839290 they wouldnt answer questions about why theyre threatening to withdraw funding from vital projects around the state when those projects are actually funded in budget documents and other planning documents
8839291 he got through the session and weve still got 48 hours to go
8839292 hes a bit of a tough nut so im expecting him to play but josh is definitely out on sunday
8839293 we thought we were over the hill with josh but he tweaked it again
8839294 young luke devere is back from japan touring with the under 20s and benny griffin and andrew packer is back as well which is why weve got a big squad
8839295 luke is a good chance but ill make a decision after training tomorrow
8839296 if we do well and we win the game on saturday ring me up on saturday afternoon and ill speak to you about the opposition
8839297 ill tell you right now we dont talk about who we play or who we might play the following week until we win this game of footy
8839298 its just a bit of a myth with the media guys that we start to talk about what may or may not occur
8839299 you just cant afford to do that in this competition otherwise you get your pants pulled down
8839300 we thought he led up really well his fitness was good and he finished his work with four goals so hes a handy inclusion for us
8839301 they all wont play in the same side so the race is on
8839302 weve got guys back who have missed a lot of footy so you wouldnt want to be taking too many of those guys into a finals campaign
8839303 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well
8839304 but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8839305 weve got two weeks to do it starting tomorrow night
8839306 im surprised that teams that finished ninth richmond 10th 11th carlton and 12th essendon get so much credit yet the teams that finished fifth collingwood sixth adelaide seventh st kilda and eighth dont
8839307 i can tell you one thing i know for certain we are going to have more chance of doing damage in the finals than carlton essendon richmond fremantle melbourne et cetera
8839308 if you look at the swans people said last year we were too old and too slow and this year we would really struggle and we wouldnt make the eight
8839309 as a club were very proud of our achievements this year
8839310 we have been able to maintain a very very high standard over the past six years
8839311 some teams havent but they seem to get credit for that so its just the environment that you operate in
8839312 its a great achievement to play in finals despite what some people would lead you to believe
8839313 people have been waiting for something like this to happen all year but really theres nothing to it
8839314 theyre trying to make issues out of things that arent quite issues
8839315 im very relaxed at the moment i know both wayne and ivan are focused on getting up to where we want to go
8839316 you handle these things delicately when theres two personalities involved
8839317 at this time of the year theres tension and nerves anyway whether coaches are going or coming
8839318 its semi final time and everyones on edge and youre tying to get a top four spot so theres always going to be tension
8839319 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8839320 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8839321 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8839322 i knew that there was a website or going to be a website about troy buswell
8839323 it didnt actually get brought to my attention that that was going to be a labor website
8839324 there are some elements of every campaign that could have been done better or not done at all and that was one of them
8839325 the people of wa want their politicians to be talking about the issues that matter not peripheral muckraking type stuff
8839326 im of the view that the treasurer definitely knew about it and on the balance of probabilities the premier would have as well
8839327 in international cricket you shouldnt take any team for granted and bangladesh is a good example of that as soon as we did they gave our backsides a kick
8839328 its not because bangladesh beat australia its because we took a team for granted
8839329 from that day ive certainly learnt that in international cricket you cant afford to do that
8839330 this is my opportunity to show the way that i want to lead australia
8839331 be my own person be aggressive positive play attacking cricket
8839332 ive learned from a lot of people but i still want to be me
8839333 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this
8839334 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8839335 since the government pulled the legislation from the house yesterday there has been no discussion with the unions and our members are furious at the lack of consultation

8839340 nelson leads the west kootenay region with the highest average selling price of homes and a real estate market that showed a 30 per cent increase in 2007 compared to the previous year
8839341 as downtown nelsons only new lakefront community kutenai landing offers outstanding value on one of nelsons last great locations
8839342 i know they got beaten 4 2 on the weekend against melbourne but they are a very fine side theyve got fullbacks who want to get forward and theyve got players in the midfield who want to try to play out all the time
8839343 daniels extremely dangerous shane smeltz is probably one of the best strikers in the a league so certainly theyre very dangerous
8839344 smeltz certainly is a big factor in their team winning or not and certainly daniel is those two drive a lot of it and especially going forward
8839345 we didnt get enough numbers going forward against queensland so to play with two up front agos going to have to be fit
8839346 that was a tough ask for robbie younis last week his debut away to queensland under that sort of pressure so we didnt expect too much from him and he was disappointed with his performance but its nothing you can hang him out to dry with it was always going to be a tough ask no matter who played in that role
8839347 dodd is a very good option we used him in the asian champions league and he was very effective for us
8839348 i know a few people have been critical of alemao personally as a footballer hes an exceptional footballer he needs time to adapt and its a different country
8839349 hes playing a different type of football than hes used to in brazil where he played a little further up and showed all his attacking flair were using him more as a fullback knowing he can get forward

8839354 when you fly the actual mission you feel like you are in a simulator
8839355 we really cant do our job without the good visual graphics that we get
8839356 it used to be about the computing part but the emphasis is shifting it is not so much about the computation but how it is presented and seen by people
8839357 they will be able to recreate scan data so fast you could see your own heart beating
8839358 this is being subsidized by all these kids out there playing games
8839359 but the advantages and uses of it are amazing but it is something we are going to have to get used to
8839360 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8839361 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
8839362 he phelps made the right decision and i think the other guy made the wrong decision
8839363 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8839364 on behalf of the rcmp i apologize for the actions of supt chambers i hope the results of our investigation assist you in bringing closure to your complaint
8839365 i decided to work towards retirement and kept my head down until i couldnt endure it any more after i got out i decided to complain because of what i went through and because i didnt want others to go through it either
8839366 i had brought this to the attention of my supervisor when it was happening the city took no action
8839367 the winners circle will include new construction and price increases along the transit corridor
8839368 the key thing we found from this thing is that if market conditions are favourable and you have supportive land use planning and decisions made by council and planners then you see successful stations
8839369 if you dont have proper planning and market conditions then you see problems
8839370 i dont think anything can make up for the hell weve been through
8839371 i lost 700 000 in revenue my customer count has dropped by about 60 per cent i have mortgaged my house twice
8839372 i would have to work for the next 10 years to get back to where i was three years ago before this started
8839373 a lot of those low level rise buildings will be demolished property values have increased so much that they are not sustained by a low level retail business with a retail shop in it
8839374 the people who are going to benefit are investors in real estate along cambie street and the real estate arm of translink and their private partners
8839375 as long as you cant hear or see that train then youre fine
8839376 we know that two thirds of the cases were probably not even seeing these are people who either have no symptoms or have mild symptoms and theyre out there spreading the virus and theres absolutely nothing we can do about that
8839377 it probably doesnt make sense to employ legal measures against people who have mumps who are finding it difficult to stay home as weve asked
8839378 you can exclude people from school i would be prepared to consider that for sure in an outbreak situation in which large numbers of people werent being immunized but if they all hang out in a mall its not much help
8839379 were not running low for normal supplies what were trying to figure out is if we need 200 000 extra doses could we get them and how long would it take
8839380 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things
8839381 they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
8839382 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8839383 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8839384 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8839385 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8839386 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8839387 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8839388 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8839389 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8839390 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8839391 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8839392 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8839393 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8839394 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
8839395 failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington
8839396 ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors
8839397 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8839398 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8839399 i was pretty sure i was going to retire in 2006 after torino
8839400 i figured id had some good experiences had some big success but ultimately the concept of competing on home turf in whistler in 2010 won out and im so glad it did its not too often that we get the opportunity to compete in front of a hometown crowd and my team and i cant wait
8839401 some of my strongest memories from both salt lake and torino was the size of the crowd and support that we felt from spectators the stands were packed the noise was crazy but i know vancouver and whistler can do a better job
8839402 our goal is to offer affordable and accessible tickets and help the paralympic movement continue to build its audience
8839403 the paralympic games are one of the best values in the world of sport and these packages will enhance that value even more
8839404 the paralympic games are something of a best kept secret around the world but vanoc wants to change this for 10 days in march 2010 600 athletes representing five paralympic sports wheelchair curling ice sledge hockey alpine skiing biathlon and cross country skiing will offer an inspirational and unique experience for spectators
8839405 for me torino would have been enough the same as ms woolstencroft i was looking at possibly retiring after torino in 2006 but because it is here at home in canada im really looking forward to finishing my career here in canada and being able to do it all in front of the hometown crowd
8839406 there would be some damage although it would not be widespread but certainly some chimneys would be damaged there would be cracks in plaster and some masonry would be damaged on the outside
8839407 these are very moderate there are earthquakes this size in the world every day
8839408 we are working in close partnership with the appropriate levels of government and stakeholders to ensure that collectively were appropriately prepared
8839409 we have swarms of activity in this area every once in a while
8839410 some hours we have an earthquake every minute or two other hours we are not quite so busy
8839411 there are so many earthquakes and so much interest from the media we havent had time yet
8839412 im not blaming you but there are only a few of us who do this
8839413 we are delighted to play an integral role in the backstage action at new yorks fashion week this year
8839414 beauty and fashion are inextricably linked we know that many of the women who love our site will be following fashion week closely and were thrilled to be able to bring them up to the minute news and highlights from the best names in fashion today
8839415 its not funny when the only person laughing is the one joking
8839416 but as a return man he sure looks like hes got a little zip to him
8839417 the next time if it did happen again like that id probably let that one go
8839418 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8839419 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8839420 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8839421 were told by the white house there are conversations underway about the schedule and whether bush will in fact speak on monday
8839422 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it
8839423 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call on it
8839424 rove is pushing romney so aggressively some folks are beginning to wonder whats going on
8839425 avevo voglia di tornare ad allenare ma il sistema non mi ha permesso di farlo in italia perch con me i presidenti si spaventano a belgrado andr finalmente in una grande squadra che ha vinto trenta campionati
8839426 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8839427 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8839428 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8839429 forces at least a temporary halt to all trains into bangkok effective friday
8839430 they told me they know they want to get rid of samak thaksin and all their cronies but the problem is they dont seem to know what will happen if they do
8839431 the leader of the pad sondhi limthongkul has told me that the entire political system needs to be changed and says that perhaps thailand isnt ready for full democracy because of the endemic corruption
8839432 the fact is that the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8839433 the resolution was to put on what evidence you have
8839434 i dont think any of this is fatal to her jurisdiction or frankly to her resolving the facts
8839435 lets do it we can figure out the details later
8839436 in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8839437 took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 51 2 million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8839438 because barack made that choice 150 000 more children and parents have health care in illinois he fought to make that happen
8839439 i want the same justice for every marine sailor soldier serving in harms way
8839440 there just wasnt enough real evidence people heard the shots but nobody saw who did the shooting thats just not enough
8839441 you dont know what combat is until youre in combat
8839442 i watched her every day i knew she was being tortured by what was being said about her son i could relate to her
8839443 comme le fant me dun jazzman dans la station mir en d route
8839444 jos mar a odriozola deber a dejar de hacer quinielas
8839445 these types of trailers theres a chute underneath it comes into a hopper a mechanism to control the flow of materials and at the base of the hopper theres a sliding trap door that opens to unload these trailers so they unload very rapidly
8839446 i talked to her and she nodded over and over and over again she wanted to leave
8839447 no athlete would like to have a life with only their eyes talking
8839448 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8839449 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8839450 al lami was a moderate official and we are surprised by his arrest
8839451 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8839452 mr wilsons central involvement in the cold war in south asia does not warrant the honor of establishing a university chair in his name
8839453 a named chair sends a public message that not only the holder of the chair but its donor represent standards to which the university and larger community should aspire
8839454 we had assumed this thing was not going to go anywhere
8839455 or if it did we would be consulted we learned about the charlie wilson chair not from the south asian institute or the dean but from the newspapers
8839456 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8839457 all around peshawar on every side the situation is volatile because of the people coming from bajur bara dera adam khel and the people from swat and waziristan
8839458 all of this is impacting the infrastructure in peshawar the schools the health system everything is overloaded
8839459 there are a lot of aspects that look like a right wing think tank im very worried about that possibility
8839460 people are concerned about the blurring of the line between friedmans technical work in economics and his fairly well known persona as a political advocate of a very pure free market conservative or neoliberal position where the market is the solution to everything
8839461 donors will receive reports and attend lectures but they wont belong to the institute
8839462 they will have nothing to do with its direction and no economist worth their salt would take that kind of direction anyway
8839463 talking more broadly about the intellectual portfolio of the university
8839464 compete much more effectively against princeton harvard and stanford schools much better endowed than we are
8839465 we had to go to half rations for a while
8839466 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8839467 we conclude that here based solely on the evidence of the pregnancy the jury could reasonably have found that 13 year old k suffered a significant or substantial physical injury
8839468 a victim who is raped and made pregnant experiences a different degree of injury than the victim who is not impregnated
8839469 because pregnancy must result in childbirth miscarriage or abortion its infliction during a sexual assault is by definition a substantial or significant injury
8839470 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8839471 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
8839472 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8839473 im humbly anticipating a game this week and thats it
8839474 i dont really know what to expect im very much looking forward to the game im ready
8839475 its a big game for us we need a win and im confident we can get one
8839476 hes been around a long time and knows what to expect
8839477 mark has done everything asked of him at training and deserves this chance
8839478 we saw dino zoff win a world cup at 40 mark needs time to get back into the rhythm and routine of football but hes still got it
8839479 i think once hes back in top condition and form theres no reason why he couldnt be regarded as one of the best in the league
8839480 la ilusi n es la regla general del universo la realidad no es m s que una excepci n
8839481 in politics each of us has a reputation and obviously mr peters is very keen as any of us would be to defend his reputation and he will be offering total cooperation to the serious fraud office
8839482 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address their matters expeditiously
8839483 mr peters is offering his total cooperation to the sfo and the first meeting between his lawyers including peter williams qc and the office will take place tomorrow morning
8839484 mr peters has been thinking very carefully about this its been clear to me this would be the appropriate course of action but there hasnt had to be a lengthy argument about this at all its accepted this is totally proper and there are precedents for it
8839485 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it
8839486 as someone who has been in politics a long time i know how precious a reputation is and how hurt people get when theres a serious assault on their reputation
8839487 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8839488 why would they never ever come and talk to me if they had an intention of coming to talk to me
8839489 kangaroo court of public opinion organised by the media in this country and others
8839490 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8839491 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8839492 criminals have become much more aggressive more insensitive and the attacks come with a much greater level of violence
8839493 its very complicated for people because the criminals know that the police are very corrupt and that nothing will happen to them even if they are caught
8839494 in the u s it is rare when the fbi does not get their man in these types of cases and in mexico its the reverse its very rare to get caught
8839495 in politics each of us has a reputation and obviously mr peters is very keen as any of us would be to defend his reputation and he will be offering total cooperation to the serious fraud office
8839496 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address their matters expeditiously

8839499 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it
8839500 as someone who has been in politics a long time i know how precious a reputation is and how hurt people get when theres a serious assault on their reputation
8839501 i will talk to the prime minister about this matter later today with the concrete evidence that she will know that these allegations are vile malevolent malicious and wrong
8839502 why would they never ever come and talk to me if they had an intention of coming to talk to me

8839506 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8839507 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8839508 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8839509 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8839510 what i discovered is that barack obama is a man of faith a man of values and a man of action someone who has shown his love for america by fighting for our people helping communities left behind on chicagos south side fighting today for working families and the tax breaks we need to purchase a home pay for college and save for retirement
8839511 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8839512 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8839513 now where do i go to get on the flight

8839521 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
8839522 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
8839523 i thought it was marvelous he laid out what he is going to do its not going to be easy but he is going to try
8839524 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8839525 he did a great job addressing the areas where he has been attacked patriotism his qualifications for the job and how he plans to pay for all his ideas
8839526 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8839527 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8839528 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8839529 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8839530 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8839531 we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year
8839532 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising
8839533 however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8839534 the doctors attending on him have given assurances that there is absolutely no cause for concern all that he needs is a good rest
8839535 his holiness will therefore join from mumbai in the 12 hour fasting and prayers for peace and freedom that are being organized in dharamsala and elsewhere on saturday 30 august 2008 by the tibetan solidarity committee
8839536 i personally told my chinese counterparts very candidly that if the talks do not make any tangible results there is no point in wasting each others time
8839537 the central government is sincere about holding contact with the dalai side
8839538 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
8839539 the more surprising the lies the easier they are to expose
8839540 drepung the largest tibetan monastery and once home to as many as 10 000 monks is now a re education camp for monks involved in the march 14 uprising
8839541 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8839542 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8839543 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8839544 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around
8839545 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8839546 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the
8839547 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8839548 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8839549 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8839550 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8839551 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8839552 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8839553 he is not in the he is in a reserved room
8839554 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8839555 it will be interesting to hear from the prosecutor when he will be able to have this new indictment
8839556 in terms of finding out about the beginning of the trial that will be vital

8839572 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
8839573 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
8839574 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy
8839575 the most amusing non stop critique of the labour government available
8839576 my favorite anglo rage boy the best apoplectic brit blogger
8839577 a widely acknowledged political genius of the first order still he finds time to visit greece sink a pint or two and take on the idiots who purport to govern our fair land
8839578 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
8839579 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
8839580 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides
8839581 wounds the religious sentiments of so many people who see in the cross the symbol of gods love
8839582 this decision to keep the statue there is is totally unacceptable it is a grave offence to our catholic population
8839583 are you as worried as me about your son getting hurt
8839584 the landslides occurred suddenly while people were sleeping after it had been raining for days
8839585 one hundred flys always comes down to finishes and some would say cavics finish was it was at that point 50 50 whether you take another stroke or you take a glide
8839586 you see phelpsy took another stroke he cavic took a glide and obviously phelps arms are coming over at a faster pace
8839587 he phelps made the right decision and i think the other guy made the wrong decision
8839588 but if he phelps had made the other decision he might not have been as lucky and he might have come away with a second and he would have come away with equalling spitzs record
8839589 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
8839590 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8839591 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8839592 its a challenge because we are obviously not playing well
8839593 but ive still got enormous faith in this group and the team and the players that we can turn it around
8839594 weve got two weeks to do it starting tomorrow night
8839595 im surprised that teams that finished ninth richmond 10th 11th carlton and 12th essendon get so much credit yet the teams that finished fifth collingwood sixth adelaide seventh st kilda and eighth dont
8839596 i can tell you one thing i know for certain we are going to have more chance of doing damage in the finals than carlton essendon richmond fremantle melbourne et cetera
8839597 if you look at the swans people said last year we were too old and too slow and this year we would really struggle and we wouldnt make the eight
8839598 as a club were very proud of our achievements this year
8839599 we have been able to maintain a very very high standard over the past six years
8839600 some teams havent but they seem to get credit for that so its just the environment that you operate in
8839601 its a great achievement to play in finals despite what some people would lead you to believe
8839602 i dont know what went on in there it was a pretty rowdy day
8839603 i think the speakers handling of the situation was pretty poor i dont know why i was bounced

8839609 young luke devere is back from japan touring with the under 20s and benny griffin and andrew packer is back as well which is why weve got a big squad
8839610 luke is a good chance but ill make a decision after training tomorrow
8839611 the huizhou project will further increase the energy supply in the pearl river delta in guangdong one of chinas economic powerhouses
8839612 lance corporal marks was killed conducting a combat operation in an extremely demanding environment
8839613 the inquiry officer looked at equipment training the operational situation and available support on the day of the incident to ascertain if there was anything that could have been done to prevent lance corporal marks death
8839614 we actually had a couple of late withdrawals and benny is an old experienced footballer so weve basically bought him along to give us a bit of experience and i guess effectively trial him for one of those overseas positions
8839615 if we do well and we win the game on saturday ring me up on saturday afternoon and ill speak to you about the opposition
8839616 ill tell you right now we dont talk about who we play or who we might play the following week until we win this game of footy
8839617 its just a bit of a myth with the media guys that we start to talk about what may or may not occur
8839618 you just cant afford to do that in this competition otherwise you get your pants pulled down
8839619 we thought he led up really well his fitness was good and he finished his work with four goals so hes a handy inclusion for us
8839620 they all wont play in the same side so the race is on
8839621 weve got guys back who have missed a lot of footy so you wouldnt want to be taking too many of those guys into a finals campaign
8839622 but having said that hamish played a game in the vfl and then he played last week and aarons played three games and theyve been doing a hell of a lot of training so a game or two under their belt is going to really see where theyre at
8839623 i know they got beaten 4 2 on the weekend against melbourne but they are a very fine side theyve got fullbacks who want to get forward and theyve got players in the midfield who want to try to play out all the time
8839624 daniels extremely dangerous shane smeltz is probably one of the best strikers in the a league so certainly theyre very dangerous
8839625 smeltz certainly is a big factor in their team winning or not and certainly daniel is those two drive a lot of it and especially going forward
8839626 we didnt get enough numbers going forward against queensland so to play with two up front agos going to have to be fit
8839627 that was a tough ask for robbie younis last week his debut away to queensland under that sort of pressure so we didnt expect too much from him and he was disappointed with his performance but its nothing you can hang him out to dry with it was always going to be a tough ask no matter who played in that role
8839628 dodd is a very good option we used him in the asian champions league and he was very effective for us
8839629 i know a few people have been critical of alemao personally as a footballer hes an exceptional footballer he needs time to adapt and its a different country
8839630 hes playing a different type of football than hes used to in brazil where he played a little further up and showed all his attacking flair were using him more as a fullback knowing he can get forward
8839631 sure he has some defensive flaws but were working on them and hes really keen to improve and try to get better defensively
8839632 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8839633 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8839634 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8839635 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
8839636 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
8839637 all jason needs to be clear of is if we can get the shoulder back in the pain aspect of it afterwards and is he able to continue to perform if the answer is yes then lets continue to play with it knowing that it could come out
8839638 unless theres something unusual about the next dislocation that he gets hell keep playing but if thats the case then all bets will be off
8839639 at the moment well continue to push on under those conditions
8839640 depending what we do with ruckman kurt tippett and whether we play him up forward as well as in the ruck we could end up with four midfielders on the bench at some stage in the game
8839641 if you lose one youve still got some artillery there to continue on
8839642 it always makes it difficult when you start losing people out of the game that cant come back on in particular midfielders but weve been through it before
8839643 we werent able to cover it against collingwood in round 15 and if we didnt get porplyzia and brett burton injured we dont know what the result wouldve been
8839644 there have been some other games this year where we have lost people and still got the result
8839645 porplyzia has earned a lot of respect the way he plays footy full stop hes improved year by year hes taken his game to another level this year and hes one of the key players in the competition theres no doubt about that
8839646 the word is from us wed be prepared to take that chance with tom williams hes hurt his shoulder as well but unfortunately hes done his thigh so thats what kept him out so he wouldve played with the same complaint
8839647 the cylinders been propelled up with significant force to do the damage that it has and its happened very quickly so it probably would have been a matter of seconds
8839648 theres nothing at this stage that the atsb can identify that could have been done to prevent this we dont really know why the bottle failed thats the key question for the investigation
8839649 anythings possible its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8839650 it would be silly not to use that sort of emotion for our benefit in this game
8839651 those three guys have been outstanding for this club and it would be sad to see them come off the field for the last time we have to make sure we play well and bring a bit happiness to the occasion as well
8839652 in saying that i had a good run and i was pretty lucky
8839653 hopefully thats done now and im on the field more often than not
8839654 they along with canberra are sides who can put tries on you from anywhere
8839655 coming from their own end they can split you open pretty easily
8839656 you cant hide from the fact that its an emotional game
8839657 its also a really important game as well im not too worried about players getting too emotional
8839658 weve had a bit of success in the past in games that have had a bit of emotion attached to them so i think we can channel that in the right direction
8839659 i knew that there was a website or going to be a website about troy buswell
8839660 it didnt actually get brought to my attention that that was going to be a labor website
8839661 there are some elements of every campaign that could have been done better or not done at all and that was one of them
8839662 the people of wa want their politicians to be talking about the issues that matter not peripheral muckraking type stuff
8839663 im of the view that the treasurer definitely knew about it and on the balance of probabilities the premier would have as well
8839664 in international cricket you shouldnt take any team for granted and bangladesh is a good example of that as soon as we did they gave our backsides a kick
8839665 its not because bangladesh beat australia its because we took a team for granted
8839666 from that day ive certainly learnt that in international cricket you cant afford to do that
8839667 this is my opportunity to show the way that i want to lead australia
8839668 be my own person be aggressive positive play attacking cricket
8839669 ive learned from a lot of people but i still want to be me
8839670 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand and slowing the rate of domestic credit
8839671 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8839672 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8839673 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that
8839674 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8839675 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points
8839676 we want to attract more ugandans in the diaspora to come back and invest in their country because the opportunities are many northern uganda is one of the places to be because peace has returned
8839677 uias mandate includes encouragement of balanced growth which can only be achieved once investments are evenly distributed across the entire country
8839678 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008
8839679 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be
8839680 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8839681 visual computing is transforming the videogame industry transforming the film industry and has all kinds of potential for how we view real time television
8839682 we solve some of the most challenging problems for more and more companies around the world let the era of visual computing begin
8839683 three d should be a new way for us to dream and design the future of our world
8839684 it will impact everything we do education science talking to each other of course games
8839685 when you fly the actual mission you feel like you are in a simulator
8839686 we really cant do our job without the good visual graphics that we get
8839687 it used to be about the computing part but the emphasis is shifting it is not so much about the computation but how it is presented and seen by people
8839688 they will be able to recreate scan data so fast you could see your own heart beating
8839689 this is being subsidized by all these kids out there playing games
8839690 but the advantages and uses of it are amazing but it is something we are going to have to get used to
8839691 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this
8839692 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8839693 since the government pulled the legislation from the house yesterday there has been no discussion with the unions and our members are furious at the lack of consultation
8839694 im less optimistic today ive no idea what is going on
8839695 sometimes it is very hard to communicate with some people in this life
8839696 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008
8839697 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban
8839698 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8839699 the coalition must do everything in its power to deny this opportunity to the taliban by ensuring that our robust procedures are implemented effectively and reviewed regularly
8839700 the men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things
8839701 they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
8839702 but what the people heard instead people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8839703 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8839704 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8839705 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8839706 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8839707 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8839708 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8839709 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8839710 have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8839711 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
8839712 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8839713 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8839714 you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq
8839715 failure to respond is a direct result of broken politics in washington
8839716 ordinary men and women students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors
8839717 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8839718 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom

8839720 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
8839721 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
8839722 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
8839723 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
8839724 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
8839725 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8839726 afghanistan is dicey i think there are certain areas of the country particularly along the pakistani border that are clearly not under the control of either pakistan or the afghan government
8839727 i am concerned about it but im not as concerned as i am about iraq today obviously or i would be talking about afghanistan but i believe if president hamid karzai can make the progress that he is making that in the long term we may muddle through it in afghanistan
8839728 and when one of his chief advisers the man who wrote his economic plan was talking about the anxiety americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and i quote a nation of whiners
8839729 phil gramm does not speak for me i speak for me
8839730 how else could he offer a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement
8839731 patients think they owe this money and it causes tremendous stress and anxiety for people
8839732 it is inappropriate to put the patient in the middle of this
8839733 one of the things ive talked to my wife lorrie about is that the first time i dont have this feeling that i have before every season starts then i know its time to get out of coaching
8839734 it starts monday of game week and it starts every single time
8839735 its just a gut wrenching feeling trying to get everything ready making sure that youre on top of things coming up next and then worrying about how your kids are going to perform thats probably the hardest thing you can prepare your kids and try to get them into the right positions to succeed but until you get out there you dont know exactly how theyre going to perform thats why its so nerve wracking because thats the one thing you cant control i can control gameplan i can control what were going to call pre game rituals but come game time when the ball is kicked you absolutely lose control of just how theyre going to perform
8839736 from nick wald who started for me for four years and knew the offense so well that he probably knew what i was going to call before i called it weve had to replace good players
8839737 after wald we had eric barker step in and star for years and then nate hollenbeck played for a year and took us to the dome before nate jacobson took us three straight times sure im nervous to see just how the team is going to step up and play but i think were to a point now where our program kind of takes over i always told the boys when we first started out in the bhc that we would get to a point where we could play with douglas and belle and custer and lead deadwood every year i think were to that point
8839738 i think he won the night from the very first moment
8839739 if youre a republican operative a close adviser to president bush youre hoping that last night john kerry lays an egg
8839740 think about that for a moment african american families across america mothers and fathers and sons and daughters watching their television screens as for the first time in our unions history a black man will stand onstage and accept that nomination and all those mothers and fathers can say to their children look you can do that some day too so put aside politics for a moment and consider no matter who wins this election no matter where your allegiances lie barack obama is about to take a step forward not only for african americans but for all americans
8839741 i was looking at him talking about the economy how many times have i heard this same speech from liberal democrats over 20 years not just at this convention
8839742 ive been reading speeches all my life but nothing like this and let me tell you what was great about it what it is is a military practice and its called attacking from a defensive position
8839743 its how henry won at agincourt its how alexander won its how reagan kicked carters butt and what you do is this you take your opponent s best shot and you throw it back on him
8839744 yes we are all the corps and the levee districts better to respond now to breaches and other issues
8839745 weve learned how to close a breach and we have the materials ready to go
8839746 im more comfortable today with the ability of everyone to respond
8839747 during katrina we had no communication with the corps for several days
8839748 but those problems seem to have been eliminated with redundant communications systems
8839749 there is also an unwatering plan that has been revised but id caution everyone to remember that anytime you get water into the heart of the city it takes time to get it out
8839750 more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8839751 more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8839752 failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8839753 on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy sen
8839754 a nation of whiners tell that to the proud auto workers at a michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty these are not whiners they work hard and give back and keep going without complaint these are the americans that i know
8839755 but what it really means is youre on your own
8839756 out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8839757 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8839758 i think hes going to handle it well and be a huge asset to the team
8839759 i told him the other day that he was going to go through a five game stretch of teams with size and speed youve never seen before
8839760 you figure hes going to go northside ph franklin county jefferson forest and botetourt right in a row probably at least four of those are going to be playoff teams thats before you even get to our river ridge district schedule
8839761 i think what made me most nervous was what people expected of me
8839762 hes the perfect quarterback for the offense we run hell be able to run and thats going to be good for us hes got a rocket arm too come out to practice one day and see hes got an impressive arm
8839763 when i heard he was transferring down here i was real excited
8839764 a couple of my friends cameron denny and james akers jonathan abate j c mcpeak all of them football players theyve all been real supportive of me they were all here for the game against northside
8839765 when ive had tough times up here and nobody to talk to here ive called them and said hey man what should i do its so much pressure i dont know how to handle it theyve helped me a lot
8839766 when i was a freshman at auburn we ran a similar system there have been some changes but its basically been some new concepts
8839767 we feel the work we needed to put in has been put in and now its time to get ready for the start of the regular season
8839768 i think thats a clear indication that we both understand that we have to start fast its important that you come out of the gate ready to roll
8839769 you saw the speed with troy he has rare speed he did some other things well too he covered kicks
8839770 it was good to get harvey some work he really was doing double day workouts he was being responsible
8839771 we got derrick signed so the last piece of the team is in place
8839772 well start against the titans a team that beat us in the first game last year and well try to change that
8839773 this was a great note for the team to end on my expectation is to build on last year we want to win a super bowl but the first thing you have to do is get into the playoffs
8839774 im going to have a few more things to show you guys this year we will have some headwear this year
8839775 its unfortunate that the buck had to stop at the lowest part of the totem pole
8839776 it sounds like the nurses pretty much run the show there
8839777 a t shirt a bit of lunch and water throughout the day
8839778 ive had i dont know how many parents say how nice this is
8839779 ive met a couple of my roommates and im looking forward to meeting the others when they get here
8839780 residents need to work with their local planning office and look at the current maps and find their property location and then find the same location on the new maps
8839781 if for some reason during the period from aug 25 to the nov 22 if they feel the new data is not correct or doesnt represent the flood hazard area on their property they can supply data to the community and they can have that submitted as a protest or appeal and they could have that map adjusted
8839782 they are 20 years old and of course the big thing is this is the best technology going that has updated those old flood maps
8839783 we dont believe there are whole lot of structures that are going to fall into this mapping series that was not in the old one we will be looking at that to see how many are and how many are not
8839784 im health minister tony clement and i have to say i approved this food
8839785 so is anyone else reminded of dubya looking under the furniture for the weapons of mass destruction
8839786 17 strategic steps to steps to achieving a six figure income or more
8839787 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8839788 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day
8839789 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
8839790 internet maps can now be personalised allowing people to include landmarks and information that is of interest to them
8839791 anyone can create their own maps or use experiences to collaborate with others in charting their local knowledge
8839792 these traditional landmarks are still on the map but people need to search for them interactive maps will display precisely the information people want when they want it
8839793 he became very impatient with us and with the coaches as well
8839794 he is at the top of the totem pole his stress goes down to everyone else you can definitely see a difference when he is having a good day were all having a good day when he is having a bad day were all having a bad day with him not being in a role where he has to control everything he is allowed to actually calm down
8839795 i walked gloria out to the car and she said you know james he just seems happier and healthier than he has been in years
8839796 now you know why i hired your butt i about near killed myself doing the head coaching job and everything else it is hard to do it really is hard to do i am enjoying this to be honest with you i have a chance to be closer with the kids
8839797 it makes the players remember that he has not forgotten them
8839798 we have 100 and something guys and people can get lost in that mix and think coach doesnt care about me and i can do whatever i want having these daily or weekly meetings with players it makes you realize wow he really has time invested in this program and in me
8839799 i dont know if they would have done that a year ago
8839800 as long as they are focusing on practice i dont mind a little bit of that
8839801 google is interested in collecting the highest quality satellite imagery available and as a symbol of this commitment has agreed to put the company logo on the first stage of our launch vehicle
8839802 the combination of geoeyes high resolution map accurate satellite imagery from geoeye 1 and googles search and display capabilities provides users with access to rich interactive visual image maps of the earth
8839803 tonight i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8839804 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8839805 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8839806 i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8839807 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8839808 its time for them to own their failure and its time for us to change america
8839809 generally supported ahmadinejads invitation some on free speech grounds and others as a move towards dialogue rather than war with iran
8839810 the republicans in a few days will nominate a good man who has served our country heroically and who suffered terribly in a vietnamese prison camp
8839811 he loves his country every bit as much as we do as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
8839812 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
8839813 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
8839814 and formed a virtual relationship until the victim ended the relationship unilaterally after they met in reality for several months
8839815 survey of consumer preferences for cars of various classes based on opinions of car owners in ukraine
8839816 this is a strategically important deal for us we previously shared this region with a number of other suppliers however under the terms of the new agreement we now cover 100 percent of the region furthermore the agreement means we will be further strengthening our efforts in the gothenburg area
8839817 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8839818 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8839819 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes
8839820 what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8839821 i accept your nomination for presidency of the united states
8839822 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8839823 lack of discussion could mean that people are fine with how things are now besides you
8839824 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation
8839825 again requirement that a actual discussion takes place is only on your head you only must provide an idea for other to express objection and grant them a chance to do it
8839826 it is sometimes difficult to make any contribution anywhere without it being considered original research

8839828 in this situation your going to need contributors to that book to participate in the discussions voice opinions on what should be changed in written form on wiki and come to some sort of consensus before anything changes regardless of any individuals interpretation

8839878 the larger goals of u s strategy depend on separating the vast majority of non violent muslims from the radical militant islamist jihadists but american efforts have not only failed in this respect they may also have achieved the opposite of what they intended

8839945 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008 he said
8839946 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8839947 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8839948 i think i did okay he said after completing the race in about 17 minutes with the assistance of crutches a respectable time just over double the winners mark
8839949 i really gutsed it out today it was definitely a tough run probably the hardest i have run on the stairs so far mr mctaggart said

8839963 it didnt actually get brought to my attention that that was going to be a labor website
8839964 there are some elements of every campaign that could have been done better or not done at all and that was one of them
8839965 the people of wa want their politicians to be talking about the issues that matter not peripheral muckraking type stuff
8839966 im of the view that the treasurer definitely knew about it and on the balance of probabilities the premier would have as well
8839967 just when i thought that i would probably never review a dvd player gain toshiba introduced their new xd e500 1080p up conversion dvd player toshiba who was one of the dvd technology and also the creator of the now defunct high definition hd dvd optical disc is coming back to the dvd marketplace with a new upconverting dvd player why while still licking its wounds from the loss of its high definition optical disc format toshiba has unveiled a new video processing technology called xde which stands for extended detail according to toshiba xde offers enhanced picture performance from standard definition dvds toshiba has also realized the folks are not quite ready to give up their dvd players just yet in favor of blu ray players either and are still quite fond of their dvds so the idea of xde was born in hopes of breathing renewed life into the dvd format the new model xd e500 which is housed in a sleek and very slender black cabinet is priced at 149 95 retail i expect it to be 99 by the holidays
8839968 the beneficial effects of the tax stimulus cheques and foreign demand are fading fast

8839970 there is no question that we are living in an era of unprecedented demand for minerals and metals
8839971 stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau
8839972 the offer on the table is still short of what we would consider full value for rio tinto and its prospects and these results emphasise that
8839973 we are demonstrating what rio tinto is really capable of
8839974 there is no question that we are living in an era of unprecedented demand for minerals and metals
8839975 come sto glielo dico subito sto studiando le carte giorno e notte e lultima cosa che vorrei fare mettermi a chiacchierare perch qui prima di pensare a volare in tutti i sensi bisogna chinare la testa e lavorare sodo ma sento girare un po di cose che non capisco o che magari capisco anche ma che non mi convincono e allora se vuole le spiego perch sto allacciando le cinture e mi imbarco con lalitalia
8839976 mi dica lei davanti a una sfida imprenditoriale coi controfiocchi dovevo starmene a casa solo perch lha proposta berlusconi e io non la penso come lui e poi la sera andiamo tutti insieme al bar sospiriamo lanciamo qualche maledizione per la sorte del paese e ce ne torniamo a casa senza fare niente mani pulite ma immobili anzi inutili e io dovrei fare limprenditore in questo modo in pratica autosospendendomi grazie ma questo ragionamento non mi convince e non ci sto
8839977 provo a dirlo in modo semplice la responsabilit se fai limprenditore una sfida come questa ti chiama come un dovere la proposta di berlusconi ma lui il capo del governo e al governo lhanno mandato gli italiani delle due luna o vado via da questo paese o ci rimango e provo a fare la mia parte quel che so fare e che mi piace anche naturalmente la responsabilit non si ferma qui ma mi impone di fare le cose secondo la mia etica e i miei ideali ha capito miei non di altri vorrei essere giudicato su questo anche negli errori che far non lo so magari mi sbaglio ma sono convinto che se tutti ragionassimo cos il paese si tirerebbe fuori dai pasticci
8839978 perch si chiama come il mio paese un servizio pubblico ha ventimila dipendenti una rete della modernit santo dio una partita che non possiamo permetterci di perdere tutti insieme
8839979 senta spero che a nessuno venga in mente che qui ci stanno regalando qualcosa prima di tutto perch nessuno mi ha mai regalato niente e poi perch il rischio grosso cos
8839980 lo so benissimo ma chi stato eletto al governo ha deciso diversamente per una sua strategia a cui certo io non ho contribuito e che tra laltro gli sta portando consensi non affar mio il consenso non dovrei neanche parlarne diciamo che ci siamo trovati con questo quadro davanti e nientaltro mi capisce bene nientaltro alitalia cos com non se la compra nessuno
8839981 ho detto che nessuno compra alitalia cos com e ho detto la verit ma a certe condizioni il signor spinetta che mi descrivono come un manager molto avveduto e molto capace lavrebbe comprata eccome trovava conveniente prenderla a condizioni meno facili di quelle odierne allora vuol dire che la bufala fa il latte
8839982 come imprenditore ma anche come cittadino rispetto il ruolo della politica che deve definire il campo di gioco io posso decidere se mi conviene giocare o no e se mi interessa ho detto di s altrimenti davanti ad una sfida che mi attirava se avessi detto di no per ragioni che stanno tutte fuori dal mio mestiere mi sarei sentito un fariseo ma insomma posso fare limprenditore come un semaforo guardando il colore se rosso mi fermo e se verde passo no se la cosa mi convince appena giallo io passo e ripeto ho un mio modo una deontologia unetica la chiami come vuole di intendere limpresa e il mio ruolo giudicatemi da questo
8839983 mi scusi ma lei sa dirmi come possiamo salvare questa azienda se non si fa cos io con tutta la buona volont non sono mica mago merlino qui lazienda cotta non c pi non c pi niente con il kerosene a 200 dollari a barile come li fa volare gli aerei provi lei a fare un giornale senza carta e senza inchiostro alitalia finita e non colpa mia e per la verit nemmeno di berlusconi o di prodi
8839984 perch avrebbe qualcosa che gli serve in cambio e che serve a rendere il paese pi moderno una compagnia aerea efficiente in un sistema aeroportuale funzionale in una rete di trasporti razionale litalia pu forse farne a meno e poi il problema riprendere alitalia per i capelli dallabisso e riportarla nel mercato una volta arrivata l coi piedi allasciutto lavoreremo secondo le leggi di mercato com evidente ma per arrivarci non c altra strada perch non ci sono risorse e gli aeroplani a pedali non li hanno ancora inventati
8839985 perch ho ottima salute finch dio me la mantiene e allora posso fare quel che mi piace seguire la mia vocazione in barca non vado al casin nemmeno cosaltro dovrei fare la natura imprenditoriale ridotta allosso tutta qui costruire qualcosa o ricostruire qualcosaltro
8839986 antitrust vuol dire concorrenza per servizi migliori a prezzi pi bassi ma non contiamoci balle la concorrenza vera nei voli aerei la fai solo se hai certe dimensioni se no scompari dunque sar sfacciato ma le dico che non credo ad un cielo concorrenziale solcato da tante piccole compagnie ma ad una robusta concorrenza tra pochi vettori grandi e solidi
8839987 senta air france ha l80 per cento dei voli nazionali in francia lufthansa il 90 per cento in germania iberia l80 in spagna e quando lei atterra a francoforte sullo schermo le indicano tutte le coincidenze e tutte le connessioni possibili cio si occupano dei passeggeri sia quando sono in volo sia quando tornano a terra voglio dire che la concorrenza si fa a livello di sistema aerei certo ma anche aeroporti infrastrutture per arrivarci e per tornare a casa con lalta velocit sui treni ci accorgeremo presto che il concetto di concorrenza un po pi largo della vecchia coppia alitalia airone
8839988 non tocca a me rispondere ma lei proprio sicuro che un campione nazionale nel sistema aereo non serva io le dico che se non ci fosse il cittadino italiano non avrebbe certi servizi noi con la nuova compagnia aerea nazionale possiamo interagire con altri sistemi e anzi possiamo diventare un soggetto di razionalizzazione di tutto linsieme
8839989 alle vere anomalie che nessuno vede come la mappa degli aeroporti italiani lasci stare se sono grandi o piccoli guardi dove sono partendo da ovest ecco cuneo torino genova milano bergamo vicenza trieste treviso e dimentico sicuramente qualcosa sul versante tirrenico genova pisa roma napoli reggio latina palermo dallaltra linate bergamo bologna forl pescara bari brindisi lecce come si pu soddisfare un numero di aeroporti cos diffusi e concentrati e intanto io per partire da milano quando arrivo da mantova ci metto quattro ore parcheggio e attesa compresi
8839990 bisogna arrivarci per forza per far partire un aereo bisogna prima avere una base clienti pi larga e pi costante e bisogna rivolgersi ai gestori degli aeroporti delle autostrade delle ferrovie per coordinare una gestione che ottimizzi il sistema e c poco da fare con un campione nazionale pi facile fare sistema mi dica lei di questo il paese ha bisogno oppure no con tutto il rispetto non come vendere caramelle stiamo parlando del futuro dellitalia e se la sfida questa un vero imprenditore come fa a starne fuori e il colore politico di chi comanda come fa a bloccarti sarebbe come se un avvocato non difendesse un imputato che ha idee politiche diverse dalle sue
8839991 potrei dirle che politico o ideologico anche chiudere malpensa per concentrare tutto a fiumicino ma in realt le dico che superficiale si faccia unanalisi geofisica del paese con tutte quelle montagne guardi le citt capir subito che dietro milano e roma non c il bacino di parigi o di londra bisogna lavorare sui due poli con un bacino strategico molto pi largo uno per tutto il nord laltro per il centro e il sud
8839992 ho le mie idee ma almeno su questo sto zitto stiamo trattando con entrambi e vanno alla stessa velocit uno dei due ci serve indispensabile
8839993 se comandare vuol dire guidare s guider io poi certo avr un amministratore delegato
8839994 il mercato che abbiamo alle spalle e straordinario il quarto in europa e il settimo o ottavo nel mondo ecco un modello perfetto per chiudere il nostro discorso quel mercato unito alla nostra vocazione imprenditoriale spiega la sfida capitalistica moderna pi di tante parole
