2420033 because theyre hot and they got boobs and i just do
2420034 exactly you just do you cant explain why you like girls anymore than a gay man can explain why he likes boys thats all i have to say
2420035 before you tell that joke sir you should know five things 1 the bartender is a blonde girl 2 the bouncer is a blonde girl 3 im a 6 feet tall 200 pound blonde woman with a black belt in karate 4 the woman sitting next to me is blonde and is a professional weightlifter 5 the lady to your right is a blonde and is a professional wrestler now think about it seriously mister do you still wanna tell that joke

2420044 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2420045 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2420046 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2420047 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2420048 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2420049 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

2420059 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2420060 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2420061 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important

2420071 the solution to iraq an iraq that can govern itself sustain itself and defend itself is more than a military mission precisely the reason why i sent more troops into baghdad

2420081 the idea of the caucus is to look at the refugee problem from a humanitarian perspective not to focus on why there are refugees but to look at solutions
2420082 the caucus is an attempt to conduct a dialogue with unrwa the un agency for palestinian refugees and not an attempt to force a solution
2420083 unrwa is performing a humanitarian task that we support even if there are some differences of opinion
2420084 the unhcrs mandate does not extend to the majority of palestinian refugees by virtue of paragraph 7 c of the organizations statute which excludes persons who continue to receive from other organs or agencies of the united nations protection or assistance
2420085 because refugees have to be physically present in unrwas area of operations to benefit from its assistance stateless palestinian refugees living beyond that area get no assistance from the agency unrwa
2420086 looks always great and its a fun car to drive
2420087 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
2420088 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
2420089 i find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving to reach the port of heaven we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it but we must sail and not drift nor lie at anchor
2420090 this car is only great for a first time driver
2420091 we think this is where the church needs to be any time a major issue of global proportion like the aids pandemic is around
2420092 the church needs to be there to show up to say we love we care and we need to be at the table this is just what jesus did when he was walking this earth he went to the market place and we should do the same
2420093 although there are some groups here that wed prefer that were not here were going to be here and were going to show love and kindness and proclaim the love of jesus christ
2420094 well to my shame for years i knew about aids and i can honestly say that i didnt care
2420095 but the truth is that when kay read that famous article about five years ago about how many kids had been orphaned by aids she shared that with me
2420096 as god began to speak to her and she began to believe that god was calling her to be a spokesperson for this particular disease my first reaction was im proud of you babe
2420097 but the more she talked about it the more it began to grab my heart and i thought ive got to care about this too i also began to realize that there were millions of people dealing with a disease that there is no cure as of yet even if you have the best medicines in the world its still chronic and so god grabbed my heart too and we said that we were going into a learning mode and weve never stopped learning and we never stopped talking about it
2420098 go home take all your jackets and jerseys off your body dont be spoil
2420099 hey i am working in a hospital i cant be joking of course im serious

2420107 that is the kind of english up with which i will not put
2420108 how can you possibly have an international agreement thats effective unless countries like china and india are not full participants
2420109 one of my concerns is that the health care not be as good as it can possibly be
2420110 this decision serves to undermine the credibility of the ongoing peace process
2420111 settlement activities prejudge the outcome of final status negotiations and compromise the viability of a concerted two state solution
2420112 privan al inversor de los beneficios que podr a razonablemente esperar
2420113 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2420114 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2420115 i believe in the importance of our roots the importance of history
2420116 the nation that forgot its history will not have a good future
2420117 what she did was to save part of our history
2420118 no surprise if the palestinians demand the return of all artefacts removed
2420119 one of the purposes of my project is to alert the international community to the need for our heritage to be protected from political disputes
2420120 because if they get permission from the fatah dominated palestinian authority in ramallah they will be boycotted here and if they get permission here from the hamas de facto government they will be boycotted in ramallah
2420121 eight oclock in the evening aug 8 2008 is a luck time for us and means good fortune in feng shui theory therefore we are planting 600 trees and also organize football tournament to welcome the olympic games to open in china and memorize the friendship between cambodian and china too
2420122 it is a great day for our best friend china to organize the event

2420125 these olympics will give the rest of the world a chance to discover who china is to discover a country that to most people is mysterious
2420126 china is seen as being different by the outside world but hopefully the olympic spotlight will help the world understand china better and maybe help china understand the world better

2420129 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2420130 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2420131 lets put the past behind us and build the future that was a political issue and we took responsibility by paying compensation for the burning of the embassy
2420132 now we provide a guarantee to thai investors in order to make them more confident
2420133 all i want to say is if the country wants to see funds flow into the country it will have to avoid look at ways to avoid creating a situation where investors start to fear
2420134 the impact we have had is very minimal as the business size that we have there is very small and it is our firms policy to not invest too much in any single country that is new to us
2420135 i must say that we are used to these kinds of downturns as we have experienced them in burma too what we do is we wait and see how things shape up and then make a decision
2420136 they usually last for a short period and things go back to normal
2420137 yes there are risks and we knew it after the 2003 incident but cambodia is a market where everything is basically imported and how many markets in this part of the world can you find where there is such a huge potential
2420138 what we have to look at long term potential and overlook the short term issues
2420139 today despite all the perceived problems we are not experiencing anything there but then our project is not for mass consumption either and it would take years before we start to realise our returns
2420140 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
2420141 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
2420142 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2420143 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
2420144 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2420145 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2420146 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2420147 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2420148 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2420149 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2420150 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2420151 life is like a bus ride you never know who you are going to meet on board and whos going to alight at the next stop but you can choose if you want that bus ride to be a pleasant one or an unhappy one

2420158 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2420164 the nation is therefore a commodity to be consumed the national day parade is packaged and marketed for the largest possible number of singaporeans although the costs of the parade run up to a hefty sum the expected returns are obviously not economic but socio psychological given the accounting mentality of state lites who expect monetary or tangible returns for every public expenditure and who take great pains to avoid any budgetary deficit the commodification of national day is calculated with intangible gains in mind the national day celebration is a highly ritualized and stylized event it is produced with the same kind of detail scale skill and intended audience as the making of a hollywood blockbuster movie like an epic movie the national day event emphasizes scale the greater the participant rate the grander is the event perceived to be this focus on scale means that there are no stars in this event everyone is an anonymous extra in a crowded scene but everyone is also an unpaid extra for thirty years national day parades have been dominated by militaristic elements an issue which i will elaborate below military music tends to be solemn very much like the background of a funeral procession and military marches are deadly serious in the emphasis on drill regimentation discipline and order by contrast modern consumption practices centre around the pursuit of pleasure the consumption imperative obliges state lites to make concessions in order to win popular consent in the modern age hegemony is achieved not just through efficiency by an lite skilled in the business of government administration but also by appeasement lites however stoic they may be must concede something to the hedonism of their subjects the populist attempt to engage singaporeans to participate in national day celebrations includes the admission of popular cultural items in 1986 a local rock group was allowed to perform during part of the spectacle in 1989 students sang la bamba choreographed steps of michael jacksons moonwalking and also break danced however given the pervasive anti western xenophobia of state elites and the apparent contradiction of western pop and the commemoration of things national such items were subsequently banished or relegated to the end of the day bash when a tamed version of carnival provides relief from the regimentation of the parade another populist strategy to engage the masses is the introduction of songs deputy prime minister lee hsien loong some members of parliament and government officials took to the stage in the finale singing we are singapore for state lites who are typically unrelenting in their policy decisions strait laced in their exhortatory speeches and austere in their sartorial codes to relax publicly in a moment of fun was a rare sight a spectacle in its own right national day in singapore is commemorated through a series of events a parade post parade party fairs at community centers dinners at electorate constituencies and some cultural performances however none of these public ceremonies in any sense constitutes a carnival carnivals like the roman saturnalia the feast of fools mardi gras and southeast asian water festivals are marked by a spirit of licentiousness and rituals of inversion which add a politically radical edge to their impact babcock 1978 ladurie 1979 bakhtin 1984 since community centers resident committees and electorate constituencies are para political organisations established by the dominant ruling party fairs and dinners held at such locations are starchy events and formal occasions even the post parade party is orchestrated closely supervised and delimited there is a conspicuous absence of camp parody of the mardi gras sort and within an hour the crowd is made to disperse the straits times 11 august 1994 the parade is overwhelmingly military in emphasis indeed all national day parades have been a military enterprise planned annually by colonels and lieutenant colonels led by sergeant majors marched staged performed and de staged by soldiers even the glossy souvenir programme is produced by the ministry of defence the sequence of each national day parade follows the logic of military protocol in this schema the highlights are always some military display while civilians and students trail behind in the last half hour of floats show and dance the military emphasis of the parade dramatizes the power dimension of the state particularly with reference to violence although a sense of oneness is promulgated in the celebration of singapores national day the parade institutionalizes separation and hierarchy the ritual dramatizes roles in clearly differentiated ways there are officials participants and spectators officials and authorities are not the participants in the marching contingents or the dancing troupes they are the reviewers and their position of dominance is marked off from subordinates by an elevated position or platform from which they can look down upon people and comfortably observe the event and within this viewing stand there are finer distinctions of status and power spatially given in the seating arrangements the rigid hierarchy of the event is further exemplified by the rank order of the marching contingents commando battalions infantry regiments police force civil defence brigades and uniformed school groups national cadet corps national police cadet corps the uniformed school groups are miniature versions of the defence forces throughout the parade the music played is militaristic infantry brass bands school military bands and police pipers the civilian contingents tend to be represented mostly by civil servants and statutory board employees private organizations are led by males who are identified by their military designation as reservists the militaristic elements the rank ordered hierarchy and the orderliness and regimentation of the event render the national day parade similar to the may day ceremony in moscows red square before the kremlin nazi germanys military processions and official rituals in beijing hanoi and vientiane under communist rule scott 1990 58 the resemblance of singapores national day parades to state rituals in fascist and communist regimes is in large part a consequence of the military dominance of the parade why does the defence force occupy center stage in national day parades the answer to this question depends very much on the intended audience of such spectacles devashayam 1990 50 argues that national day represents a symbolic dialogue with malaysia in a sense national day in singapore does not connote independence or liberation from colonial rule the 9th of august 1965 was the day singapore was expelled from the malaysian federation given this inauspicious expulsion the display of military might in national day parades calls malaysias bluff such military exhibitionism is also targeted to the local population not only as visual entertainment of the top gun and star wars epic film variety but also as reassurance of safety under the current political leadership how far this reassurance is realistic or not is a moot point but military exhibitionism usually indicates anxiety rather than security it is precisely because singaporeans are still not courteous that courtesy campaigns have been waged for more than twenty years to drum into people the need for behavioural change so too thirty years of annual displays of the defence forces serve to instill confidence where this is waning or lacking there is no feminine analogue to national service if there were the most likely candidates would be a contingent of pregnant women marching in university gowns and mortarboards graduate mothers who procreate in line with the eugenic policy that the more educated a woman is the more children she should have would be deemed to have executed their duties and responsibilities of national service although the above responses demonstrate the emotive intensity of some audience members responding to the national day parade they are not to be taken as representing the unanimous consensus of a national collectivity just as pop fans who are moved by the melody or tune of a song need not comprehend the literal and symbolic meanings of its lyrics so too national fans entranced at the specific moment by the mobilizing power of a ceremonial ritual need not at other times express loyalty or patriotism street 1986 the media in singapore are unlikely to give voice to dissenting individuals and alternative views one has to read between the lines to tease out an unknown number of repressed consumers in the report on overseas singaporeans celebrating national day abroad an incidental reference was made to a lucky draw at the end of all the rituals of flag and anthem observances tan 1994 lucky draws can be said to be a typical singaporean way of enticing consumers to buy a product and luring individuals to participate in some official function in the latter context the lucky draw always takes place at the end of the event after all the ceremonial rituals have been performed this is to make the participants stay till the end among spectators the motive for attending the parade may be less than patriotic each spectator gets a parade kit carried to the extreme the kiasu habit confuses ends with means one may join a queue without knowing what it is for but nevertheless one assumes that since so many people are in the line it must be for something highly desirable because the ruling political party in singapore is a dominant party and claims to represent singapore there is a conflation between singapore and the pap by association the singapore flag takes on the meaning of the pap too the differential distribution of flags based on support for pap institutions reinforces this conflation thus singaporeans who resist the flag do so in order to dissociate themselves from others who are pap supporters or sycophants the straits times 3 september 1994 those who are able to differentiate between loyalty to the nation and loyalty to the pap thus refuse to hang the flag singapores national day parade is so highly structured so meticulously coordinated so scripted to a protocol and so hierarchically arranged that it resembles communist state rituals more than street carnivals its structuredness underscores the values of order discipline and compliance short of this free articulation of multivocality the category of repressed consumers suggests that nation building in singapore again bears resemblance to the soviet model of socialist realism socialist realism was the state formula for aesthetics in the soviet union art should picture reality not in terms of an accurate portrayal of society but in terms of what that society should be art should picture life not as it is so much as life as it should become schudson 1986 215 so fiction should dramatize politically correct heroes art should inspire people to socially correct behaviour nation building in singapore follows this logic of socialist realism by suppressing social realities and replacing them with social ideals as defined by state elites history is erased through collective amnesia nationalist images in singapore seldom refer to the past for inspiration

2420255 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2420256 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2420257 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2420258 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2420259 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2420260 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2420261 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2420262 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2420263 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2420264 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2420265 a little rough around the edges but when you look closely absolutely beautiful and the only one of her kind
2420266 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2420267 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2420268 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2420269 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2420270 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2420271 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2420276 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

2420278 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2420279 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2420280 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2420281 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2420282 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2420283 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2420284 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2420285 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2420286 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2420287 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2420288 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2420289 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2420290 im so sorry i know you can never forgive me but i just wanted to tell you how badly i fucked up i dont expect anything from you but i just wanted to say sorry
2420291 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2420292 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2420293 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2420294 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2420295 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2420296 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2420297 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2420298 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2420299 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2420300 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2420301 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

2420327 im a mural artist who has discovered the challenge of painting on canvas rather than walls its limited space but i love it what better place to crawl into your thoughts when you can create them in front of your own eyes
2420328 i am a stay at home mom who needs a break from the 17 month old that i call my son he is very active and keeps me very busy my husband and i recently relocated with his job
2420329 i am single and looking and am told by pogo chatters that i am funny i have a serious side and am very opinionated about things in our world and life in general i dont smoke and drink socially and i am a great cook
2420330 i am the last born of a big family and also a twin my parents were in the navy so we traveled around a bit and then decided to settle in georgia no i am not a peach per se but
2420331 i was born and raised a redneck from the south in my home town of wichita kansas but i now live in michigan i enjoy football camping occasionally visiting the casino and playing pogo games
2420332 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
2420333 it is our single minded focus to keep the highway through and ensure supplies to kashmir
2420334 they are apparently trying to out do each other in the similar fashion as they first did on the land to the shri amarnath shrine board for they view electoral gains in it
2420335 i wouldnt say its an easy job it can only get worse if you look at it that way
2420336 ive had more good days than bad days so far in my career i just have to keep enjoying myself and trying to improve but its no surprise that i keep improving because i wake up every single morning trying to get better
2420337 i didnt think so because before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work i normally do
2420338 i just had to spend the extra time with the other players to build the confidence which kept me a little bit longer at training
2420339 but in terms of batting you just have to go out and bat you cant be a captain when youre batting you just have to go out to score as many runs as you can
2420340 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can i built an innings played straight played in my areas played a few shots which were funky i suppose but just got on with it
2420341 it does mean more because of the scrutiny but in terms of me and how ive been playing i have been getting hundreds and scoring runs
2420342 in terms of my relationship with the players i have to keep growing that that has come on leaps and bounds in the four days i have been in charge
2420343 im getting to learn a lot more about how the guys operate and you have a really different perspective you really want them to do well for them for you the team its really a holistic thing
2420344 i honestly think anyone making the cut right now has still got a chance
2420345 those going out in the morning with the better greens can post a number and there is no reason why they cant get close to the lead
2420346 i was close to the cut at the open and finished tied for seventh i dont see why you cant do the same here
2420347 the guys at the top know how tough it can be and while they have played great golf to get there they need to play well to stay at the top
2420348 i felt like i did nothing wrong the last few holes i have gone from feeling i was right in the tournament at three over coming down the 16th
2420349 i missed a couple of chances like the par five 12th and a birdie chance on the 14th which i let slide past the hole
2420350 then all of a sudden a couple of misjudged putts the greens are very tricky and i thought the putts were good left me with long par saves which both slid by as they are getting a bit spiky out there
2420351 the community shield holds good memories for me i headed the winner about 10 minutes from the end against chelsea two years ago and it was doubly good because i had one disallowed in the fa cup final against west ham a few months earlier
2420352 ive come back to portsmouth to further my career and it would be a great start to do something special at wembley
2420353 its going to be really hard against united even though theyve got a few missing but playing at wembley lifts everybody
2420354 its a fantastic occasion just like a cup final and with all the new signings turning out
2420355 accepts the situation it is not a bottomless pit after all
2420356 i do believe that and im hoping its true tiger woods has made it look very easy and therefore for some of the younger guys its easy to get frustrated that you are not doing it yourself
2420357 you look at nick faldo even ben hogan they didnt start winning majors until they were in their late 20s and you have to start somewhere
2420358 you cant always keep saying well im gaining experience im gaining experience there is a time to start believing this is the time to do it the time is now
2420359 its a bit of a catch 22 i think experience in majors is essential just the environment the golf course and i think the art of patience in majors is the key
2420360 ive got to think its right up there with the best round ive played all year
2420361 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2420362 i think more importantly it was the round that i felt most at ease out there and really calm with my emotions in the moment and playing one shot at a time and thats what ive been struggling to do
2420363 obviously when youre not playing great golf its very easy to get frustrated out there on the course and although sometimes you dont show it youre trying your hardest out there its very easy when you do make a mistake or two to get frustrated
2420364 today i felt like i made plenty of mistakes but i didnt really react to them and i got rewarded with some great recovery shots
2420365 i knew this week was key to the ryder cup and it still is key
2420366 you treat both impostors wins and defeats the same way
2420367 you can train twice as hard as a team and lose by one point as you can when you win by one point were certainly still together as a team
2420368 the attitude has been good in training but the bigger test comes this saturday it was definitely not a sense of relief after the hull win the players were stung by the criticism that came their way and the good thing is they responded in the only way they could respond
2420369 you have to treat the trip as a positive if you think of it as a negative it will become a negative
2420370 look at the playing roster and what they have got going im expecting a huge reaction from them after their defeat at hull kr as i was expecting a huge reaction from us last friday
2420371 its a great place to play and saturday is definitely a game i would have loved to play in
2420372 they beat leeds in the challenge cup and blew away wakefield but if we go there thinking we cant do a job or perform we have defeated ourselves before we have taken to the pitch
2420373 louis has done great for us this year and its a big blow to lose vinnie because hes been good for the team and to me personally i get on really well with him and he is a top bloke
2420374 this has implications for our picture of neanderthals and perhaps the reasons for their extinction if the population was teetering on the brink for hundreds of thousands of years it maybe changes our impression of what it would have taken to make them go extinct rather than if there were millions of them
2420375 for those of you that are unfamiliar with the 100 mile mountain bike race in

2420377 die georgische seite hat beschlossen in der gesamten region die verfassungsm ige ordnung wiederherzustellen
2420378 bisher steht nicht fest wer den waffenstillstand zuerst gebrochen hat klar ist aber dass georgien eine offensive gegen ein gro es ziviles zentrum begonnen hat
2420379 die gefahr ist dass der konflikt zum ausgewachsenen krieg eskaliert
2420380 georgische streitkr fte haben heute nacht einen akt der aggression gegen russische friedenstruppen und friedliche einwohner begangen in s dossetien sterben jetzt friedliche menschen frauen kinder und alte die mehrheit von ihnen b rger der russischen f deration

2420399 there was one little girl i took for eight years and when she first started going to the hospitals there didnt seem any chance of her walking i was privileged to take her to greenville last year for her last trip
2420400 when she walked out of that clinic she walked just as straight as you and me
2420401 she had a great big grin on her face and i knew she had been released she came up and hugged my neck

2420460 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2420461 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2420462 instead of alleging concrete injury plaintiffs assert a generalized grievance with a particular government policy
2420463 whether this case should be dismissed for lack of standing
2420464 should a group of u s stem science technology engineering and mathematics workers and organizations representing stem workers have standing to challenge a rule intended to increase the supply of stem workers in the u s
2420465 will experience further job displacement denials of job opportunities wage depression and increase d job competition by a dhs estimate of 12 000 to 30 000 foreign workers
2420466 that granting the preliminary injunction is consistent with the public interest in preserving jobs and wages for american workers
2420467 it was certainly up and down im just happy to have shot even par today
2420468 thats a great measure of how i have played this year
2420469 im starting to feel comfortable when im playing in the big events i always pushed it too much in the big events i tried to force results trying to make it happen instead of just going out and playing
2420470 just made a bit of stupidity and got a bad break it bounced on the back edge of the green and hit a cart path and ended up over the back and that was not the place to be
2420471 the tv cameras were getting close and they didnt really care when we teed off
2420472 the split decision overturned a previous court ruling and has temporarily denied attempts by tribes and environmental groups to stop arizona snowbowl ski resort from expanding development and making fake snow from treated sewage effluent on the holy mountain
2420473 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2420474 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2420475 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2420476 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2420477 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2420478 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2420479 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2420480 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2420481 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2420482 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2420483 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2420484 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2420485 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2420486 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2420487 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2420488 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2420489 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2420490 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2420491 indigenous peoples have the right to manifest practice develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions customs and ceremonies the right to maintain protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects and the right to the repatriation of their human remains

2420500 as a high luxury brand we are representing europe to the world
2420501 we want a strong outcome for the environment but we dont want the rules to disproportionately disadvantage small volume and niche manufacturers many of which are in the uk
2420502 we dont believe the intention is to make us extinct
2420503 we are committed to reduce co2 emissions heavily in the next years so we are doing whatever is possible without destroying the dna of the brand to bring them down to a much better level than today
2420504 rucker was struck by tollison 13 times during this time
2420505 utilized a taser and strikes to ruckers side in order to have him comply with deputies commands to allow him to be handcuffed
2420506 the use of force by these deputies was reviewed and determined to be in compliance with sheriffs office policy tollisons use of force against rucker has been determined to be excessive and does not comply with sheriffs office policy
2420507 a bridgehead is being prepared for the start of milita
2420508 weve had two good wins in a row but in saying that weve got to continue that
2420509 we cant turn around next week and rest on our laurels parramatta is a team we havent beaten in a while
2420510 i havent beaten them in my first grade career so its going to be tough
2420511 weve got to back it up every loss from now in is one game closer to the end of our season
2420512 its tough at this stage of the year everyone is carrying a few bumps and bruises but were looking forward to the long week with the monday game so guys can lick their wounds a bit
2420513 this was another step towards the semi finals it was a big game
2420514 its the first time for a while weve gone back to back and made the most of the last weeks game and beat a credible side away from home so thats a step in the right direction
2420515 i think thats the way the competition is there is a big clump of teams on 22 23 and 24 so we are well aware of where we sit and what the coming four weeks hold
2420516 they the tigers scored a try from a kick and a try from our kick so defensively i think we are right up to the mark as good as anyone
2420517 but we need to obviously do something in our attack which will hopefully help us get over the line a little bit more
2420518 hopefully once the afl makes a decision one way or the other that will be the end of the campaign because we as a club are trying so hard to not only meet our obligations but to exceed them
2420519 its a bit hard when at the same time a campaign is being run by your major sponsor fundamentally saying wed rather have our own team
2420520 although weve got three years to go in this particular partnership we are working very very hard to give tasmania exposure on the mainland and to bring not only increased tourism here but increased investment from corporates
2420521 but there must come a time when the tasmanian community understands the costs and the risks and if it doesnt bear up then i hope again you can fully embrace the efforts hawthorn is doing and making on your behalf
2420522 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2420523 another three died in overnight attacks altogether 15 peacekeepers have been killed
2420524 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
2420525 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
2420526 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2420527 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2420528 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2420529 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2420530 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2420531 real results by the end of my first term in office
2420532 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2420533 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2420534 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2420535 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2420536 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2420537 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2420538 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2420539 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2420540 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2420541 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2420542 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2420543 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2420544 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2420545 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2420546 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2420547 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2420548 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2420549 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2420550 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2420551 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2420552 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2420553 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2420554 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2420555 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2420556 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2420557 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2420558 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2420559 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2420560 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2420561 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2420562 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2420563 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2420564 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2420565 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2420566 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2420567 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2420568 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2420569 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2420570 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2420571 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2420572 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2420573 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2420574 i will criticize him or other democrats when they fall short
2420575 you are so out of touch with the serious interpretation of the bible that everyone knows is the only possible one
2420576 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2420577 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2420578 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2420579 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2420580 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2420581 just so you all know we did set a record
2420582 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2420583 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2420584 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2420585 what drives the nader gonzales campaign clearly is the country is in deep trouble
2420586 the giant corporations are tearing the heart and soul out of america in so many ways the corporate crime wave being the more recent one and john mccain and barack obama are ignoring corporate crime they want a bigger military budget they want to stay in iraq they want to expand the war in afghanistan and theyre not good on consumer protection at all
2420587 theyre using a lot of money in their campaigns from commercial interests and in many ways theyre similar
2420588 theyre not really for a living wage theyre both opposed to a canadian style health care system which gives you free choice of doctor and hospital hows that for starters
2420589 no one dies in canada because they cant afford health insurance everyone has it but 18 000 americans die every year according to the national academy of scientists because they cant afford health insurance
2420590 so it does not subordinate environmental consumer and labour rights to the supremacy of commercial power
2420591 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to continue counterterroism missions in iraq against al qaeda
2420592 bush burned down a haystack to try to find a couple of needles he didnt find the needles but there have been 1000s of innocent deaths
2420593 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
2420594 i dont really have anything worthwhile to say but i might as well bash harper since thats the in thing to do
2420595 in canada you get to choose your own doctor and hospital
2420596 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2420597 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2420598 there is nothing left now but to ensure that my infant son does not meet the same fate as the rest of my doomed race
2420599 i will send him to a new planet where he will i hope be raised by simple but kindly country folk and grow up to be a hero and protector to his adopted home
2420600 on his new planet earth physiology will react to the radiation of a differently colored sun causing him to develop abilities far beyond those of mortal men
2420601 he will be faster than a speeding prius stronger than the existing superfund program and able to leap mountains of red tape in a single bound these superpowers will sustain him in his never ending battle against conservatives wealthy industrialists and other environmental supervillains
2420602 in brightly hued tights it will be harder for people there to ignore him when he takes on his new planets lobbyists auto manufacturers and enemies of justice
2420603 a bold and eye catching unitard will give kal al last son of earth a formidable tool for protecting his new planet a power more awesome than any his father could have dreamed of the power of charisma
2420604 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
2420605 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2420606 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2420607 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2420608 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2420609 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2420610 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2420611 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2420612 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2420613 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2420614 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2420615 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2420616 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2420617 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2420618 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2420619 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2420620 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2420621 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2420622 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2420623 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2420624 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2420625 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2420626 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2420627 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2420628 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2420629 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2420630 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2420631 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2420632 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2420633 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2420634 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2420635 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2420636 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2420637 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2420638 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2420639 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2420640 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2420641 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2420642 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2420643 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2420644 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2420645 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2420646 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2420647 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2420648 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2420649 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2420650 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2420651 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2420652 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2420653 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2420654 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2420655 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2420656 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2420657 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2420658 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2420659 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2420660 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2420661 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2420662 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2420663 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2420664 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2420665 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2420666 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2420667 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2420668 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2420669 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2420670 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2420671 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2420672 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year

2420674 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2420675 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2420676 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2420677 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2420678 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2420679 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2420680 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2420681 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2420682 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2420683 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2420684 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2420685 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2420686 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2420687 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2420688 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2420689 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2420690 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2420691 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2420692 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2420693 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2420694 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2420695 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2420696 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2420697 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2420698 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2420699 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2420700 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2420701 reading your responses and talking to tad devine the former chief consultant to al gore and adviser to the kerry
2420702 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2420703 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2420704 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2420705 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2420706 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2420707 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2420708 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2420709 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2420710 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2420711 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2420712 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2420713 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2420714 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2420715 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2420716 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2420717 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2420718 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2420719 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2420720 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2420721 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2420722 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2420723 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2420724 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2420725 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2420726 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2420727 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2420728 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2420729 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2420730 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2420731 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2420732 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2420733 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2420734 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2420735 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2420736 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2420737 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2420738 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2420739 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2420740 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2420741 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2420742 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2420743 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
2420744 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
2420745 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
2420746 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
2420747 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
2420748 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2420749 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2420750 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2420751 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2420752 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2420753 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2420754 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2420755 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2420756 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2420757 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2420758 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2420759 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2420760 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2420761 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2420762 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2420763 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2420764 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2420765 the influence of polling location on voting found in our research would be more than enough to change the outcome of a close election
2420766 voting at a school could increase support for school spending or voting at a church could decrease support for stem cell initiatives
2420767 environmental cues such as objects or places can activate related constructs within individuals and influence the way they behave
2420768 voting in a school for example could activate the part of a persons identity that cares about kids or norms about taking care of the community similarly voting in a church could activate norms of following church doctrine such effects may even occur outside an individuals awareness
2420769 we want factors like political views whether someone thinks a candidate is going to make our country a better place to sway elections
2420770 but in forming election policy we also want to make sure that arbitrary factors such as polling location dont ultimately influence voting behaviors
2420771 what our research suggests is that it might be useful to further investigate influences such as polling location to better understand how such factors affect different types of voting situations
2420772 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2420773 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2420774 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2420775 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2420776 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2420777 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2420778 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2420779 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2420780 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2420781 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2420782 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2420783 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2420784 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2420785 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2420786 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2420787 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2420788 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2420789 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2420790 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2420791 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2420792 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2420793 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2420794 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2420795 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2420796 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2420797 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2420798 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2420799 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2420800 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2420801 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2420802 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2420803 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2420804 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2420805 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2420806 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2420807 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2420808 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2420809 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2420810 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2420811 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2420812 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2420813 sucking a lot of energy from the evil energy companies
2420814 find a quiet corner of north america and stay out of historys way
2420815 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
2420816 its docked at hurricane marina on center hill lake in smithville
2420817 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2420818 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2420819 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2420820 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2420821 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2420822 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2420823 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2420824 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2420825 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2420826 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2420827 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2420828 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2420829 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2420830 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2420831 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2420832 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2420833 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2420834 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2420835 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2420836 bottom line there is a threat of homegrown terror in america
2420837 it is not as great as in european cities but it is growing and we have to take it seriously
2420838 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2420839 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2420840 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2420841 the two motorcycles were traveling west in the 1800 block of 11th avenue said nick krakalia with the lewiston police department
2420842 the gold colored one was on the outside it came too close to the right side of the other motorcycle and part of the motorcycle or her foot hit the right leg of the other driver causing them to crash
2420843 she had head and facial injuries and she was unconscious at the time of transportation
2420844 the other driver complained of leg injury but declined medical attention at this time
2420845 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2420846 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2420847 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2420848 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2420849 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2420850 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2420851 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2420852 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2420853 its a phenomenon thats being fuelled by the growth in designer pregnancy wear

2420860 a man hostile to those who did not share his views even his predecessors such as sheikh ibn taymiya and sheikh mohammad bin abdul wahab he was nicknamed the sheikh of strife
2420861 used to indicate the students and supporters of sheikh al hirari in reality al ahbash are an organization called the association of islamic charitable projects
2420862 the association rejects the takfir ideology and opposes the use of violence against the ruling authorities and the killing of the elderly women and children it does not depend on any government for financial support and rejects the takfir ideologies that denounce muslims as infidels

2420885 when not interfered with by outside influences everything nature does is done with perfection yet my son shay cannot learn things as other children do he cannot understand things as other children do where is the natural order of things in my son
2420886 i believe that when a child like shay physically and mentally handicapped comes into the world an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself and it comes in the way other people treat that child
2420887 were losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning i guess he can be on our team and well try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning
2420888 the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world
2420889 i think it would have complicated what were trying to do
2420890 i think we would have been accused and rightfully so of not getting off our addiction to the strategy that worked for so many years but then didnt work and that we were slow to recognize didnt work
2420891 we would have continued our addiction to it without bonds that i think would have been a mistake we probably wouldnt have aaron rowand if that had happened we still had randy winn freddie lewis wouldnt be starting wed have a great hitter to me mannys been the best hitter in the american league the last 15 years or so he still would have been on a club in my opinion that wasnt going to win 90 games
2420892 im sure he feels he didnt leave under circumstances that he felt he deserved
2420893 i understand that he would say with all i did for this franchise i should be allowed to go out on my own terms yes we felt we had to go in a different direction i tried to tell him why we had to do that i think he understood the logic of it but i think he just didnt want to hear that
2420894 i thought some calls were missed tonight which was unfortunate
2420895 these guys the umps are good but there were a handful of changeups i thought were in the zone that changes the at bats that part is frustrating but ive got to make better pitches with my changeup
2420896 the rest of the inning was all right i had decent stuff a couple of strange things happened but that was it
2420897 because hes thrown some fine ballgames big innings have hurt him this season
2420898 since the first couple of outings i dont look at who is at bat
2420899 when they come up i try to zone that out so i dont get star struck or pitch around them its been working a little bit so ill just keep on throwing my stuff

2420909 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2420910 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2420911 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2420912 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2420913 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2420914 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2420915 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2420916 there is no report of any untoward incident so far from any curfew bound area the situation is peaceful
2420917 if there will be a serious decision to end the occupation of iraq those cells will vanish
2420918 there will be no reason to let those cells stay and work
2420919 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to help the iraqi people
2420920 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2420921 it is a deliberative cultural religious social army devoted to ideological and scientific jihad and freeing brains and hearts and the human spirit from the western secular hegemony
2420922 i feel very bitter that nobody does seem to even care even now that this report has been made public
2420923 i lost my innocence to men i did not have any idea who they were and now all that the french government can give back is rubbish all the evidence against its soldiers
2420924 recently i heard that they want to arrest our people for whatever they accused them at least they did not rape children like their own soldiers
2420925 i was brought by interahamwes to the stadium as they beat me and white soldiers dressed in military uniform were there one pulled me by hand and took me into a tent as i resisted he slapped me hard he tore my skirt off force my legs wide and penetrated me
2420926 i felt as if a metal was penetrating me the pain was so much i screamed so hard but nobody was helping me i was bleeding i felt it would be better if i died he finished raping me and moved out
2420927 we believed we were safe after the war was ending and we had seen whites bazungu claiming to have come to protect us we knew everything was ok
2420928 i was wrong my suffering was just going to start
2420929 in the stadium kamarampaka the interahamwe took me there directly and there were many white soldiers all over i was put in a room of the tent just near by and the next thing a huge white soldier entered and closed the tent closure and undressed
2420930 i was very small he just lifted me like a baby ripped off my cloths and he started raping me
2420931 the pain was terrible i screamed till i lost my breath i was bleeding profusely then he changed and penetrated me through my mouth
2420932 justice unfettered justice will one day be done power should not come with impunity
2420933 history shows that the road to justice is bumpy when genocide is involved due to the complexity of the crime its complicated but not impossible
2420934 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2420935 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2420936 the united states calls for an immediate cease fire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2420937 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2420938 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2420939 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2420940 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2420941 what we heard is that the state department and the entire administration is deeply concerned and that they are heavily engaged with russia trying to de escalate the situation
2420942 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2420943 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2420944 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2420945 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2420946 jammu gujjar muslims have always been nationalist supported army and have devoutly worked for the amarnath pilgrimage and vaishnav devi yatra yet they were attacked during the ongoing agitations over amarnath shrine land dispute
2420947 today muslim gujjars are frightened they have packed themselves in their homes fearing anytime one can attack them they are not going to work
2420948 we will meet the all party team coming from delhi and we will demand to form an enquiry to assess the economic damage done to gujjars we want that government of india or the state government should announce relief and compensation package for the the muslim gujjars
2420949 to protect the life and property of the nomadic muslim gujjars of jammu region who are facing adversities and hardships as more than 100 houses of the tribal group set afire by protesters in jammu samba and kathua districts during 38 day long agitation over the land row
2420950 our people are shelterless in many areas of jammu samba and kathua even more than 100 families are waiting for a relief and rehabilitation package
2420951 when we all came back from the war it was all pushed to the back of our minds
2420952 as far as i could see it was total destruction
2420953 the city is built in a valley with a large number of hills surrounding it there wasnt much in that valley that was more than 2 to 3 feet tall
2420954 i said at the time that president truman could have given a demonstration of the bomb that might have been effective
2420955 i knew where my division was to land and we saw the 16 inch guns positioned on those beaches
2420956 they simply did what they believed was right and we did too
2420957 est convencido de que britney estar brillante en ese papel
2420958 its a disaster from heaven theres nothing you can do about it but after the earthquake the olympics no longer mean as much to us
2420959 it was going to pass just 18 kilometres away my girlfriend and i began making plans in march to take the day off to see it well that wont happen now they cancelled it because of the earthquake
2420960 sure its dangerous but we can either eat bitter fruit or we can watch the opening ceremonies on tv we are a happy family
2420961 the olympic spirit has now seeped into our daily life
2420962 of course its true that we lost many dear and loved ones and we are going to miss them my hope is that we are going to take their dreams for the olympics and commemorate them by making them even bigger
2420963 i lost a grandson but dont ask me about that
2420964 and i realized what it was i thought immediately of lin wei so i rushed to the school
2420965 once i got there i saw the buildings third floor where my grandson was was gone but i couldnt do anything there were so many huge concrete beams nobody could move them i could hear kids crying inside and i could see one hand sticking out one leg sticking out they were trapped we couldnt get to them
2420966 some students who escaped said to look in the first row and then they saw his face and the military dug him out i had two bottles of water with me because it was so hot but there was so much dust on him i used the water instead to wash his face
2420967 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
2420968 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while
2420969 but by all appearances this has been added to disable
2420970 you dont own the network that the web based product runs on and thus cant do whatever you want

2420984 its not easy and we had to choose somebody and we chose him right now
2420985 i just told him last year we were not very good and we would have been horrid had he not been here and i wanted him to know how much i personally appreciated what he had done i felt like we had a good relationship and were going to miss him you keep moving things along and youre always trying to make yourself better and we have we had to choose somebody and it was him
2420986 hope they make the right move i move on and see what happens the last couple of months
2420987 it definitely has those playoff implications but the biggest thing is we have to not look past anybody right now
2420988 we have to play who is in front of us right not and that is the angels and then we go to minnesota
2420989 these guys like to play baseball and i think this schedule and the competition is really what keeps guys sharp
2420990 it is a collection of the type of guys that we have in here
2420991 as you can tell we dont get too high we dont get too low and that kind of goes along with keeping our focus
2420992 we dont really have any breaks even in our division we have to play good games or else were not going to find ourselves in the playoffs
2420993 the nice thing we have here is a lot of veteran players so they understand what it means to play the game

2420995 tidak dinafikan ada peserta yang prestasinya sama baik dengan cecilia malah ada di antara finalis ini begitu kreatif dalam mempersembahkan tarian mereka namun dalam hal ini kita terpaksa akui bahawa populariti mengatasi segala galanya
2420996 cecilia bukannya tak bagus persembahannya dalam program ini cukup konsisten dan ditambah dengan pakej yang ada padanya membuatkan dia mempunyai tarikan untuk membuat penonton memilihnya sebagai juara
2420997 saya memberikan analogi mudah untuk menjelaskan perkara ini cuba kita lihat dua penyanyi ini iaitu aishah dan datuk siti nurhaliza pada saya kalau hendak dibandingkan dari segi suara pada saya vokal aishah lebih gemersik dari siti
2420998 tetapi siti pula mempunyai kelebihan dari segi pakej jadi dalam hal ini cecilia menang dari segi itu
2420999 bukan saja cecilia tetapi saya melihat keseluruhan peserta musim kedua ini lebih profesional kalau musim pertama kebanyakannya adalah penari jalanan tetapi kali ini kebanyakan yang datang uji bakat dan terpilih adalah profesional dan lebih matang
2421000 pun begitu sekiranya saya mempunyai kuasa penuh dalam memilih pemenang saya akan memilih black kerana dia adalah seorang penghibur yang baik dan kreatif orangnya dia tahu bagaimana nak menghiburkan penonton dan ada karisma tersendiri
2421001 saya lebih suka jika juri diberi kuasa penuh untuk memilih pemenang kerana kita boleh tentukan ke mana arah tuju dan standard yang akan dibawa oleh seseorang peserta itu sebagai contoh kita boleh lihat secara teknikal tarian yang mereka persembahkan dan dari situ kita sudah dapat mengagak sejauh mana kualiti seseorang peserta itu sebelum dia diangkat sebagai juara
2421002 oh saya tidak menganggap ia sebagai satu kelebihan tetapi ia membantu saya untuk mengecapi apa yang diinginkan lagipun adalah sesuatu yang realiti apabila seseorang yang hadir dengan pakej yang lengkap menjadi pilihan pengundi
2421003 pun begitu saya bekerja keras untuk menang dan nampaknya usaha saya selama ini berhasil dan inilah yang saya inginkan sebagai bukti kecintaan saya pada bidang tarian
2421004 saya memang tidak sangka akan menjadi pilihan penonton untuk menjuarai pertandingan ini kerana sepanjang ketika kami mengadakan roadshow black sering menjadi tumpuan sebab itu apabila diumumkan sebagai juara saya terkejut

2421020 mi sono sentito bene ho giocato senza dolore sto migliorando giorno dopo giorno da oltre una settimana che lavoravo per questo rientro chiaro ora mi manca un po il ritmo partita ma andato tutto bene come speravamo
2421021 mourinho nei giorni scorsi mi ha chiesto come mi sentivo lui in allenamento mi vedeva bene e anchio gli ho detto si sono pronto posso tornare a giocare per me era importante scendere in campo era importate per capire come stava andando il lavoro e il risultato stato positivo
2421022 valuteremo nelle prossime ore come risponder il ginocchio ma io credo che risponder bene e quindi spero di giocare domani e anche a lisbona contro il benfica lultima amichevole
2421023 stato veramente buon allenamento non facile giocare contro una squadra come il siviglia veloce tenace dinamica e che ha fatto vedere un ottimo calcio in questi anni abbiamo giocato meglio nel secondo tempo soprattutto a livello di movimenti la squadra si mossa bene ed stata sempre compatta soprattutto nella fase difensiva adesso dobbiamo perfezionare alcune situazioni di organizzazione di gioco specialmente negli ultimi 15 metri con una squadra come la nostra si pu migliorare ancora molto siamo riusciti a creare delle occasioni pericolose anche loro hanno avuto qualche buona occasione quindi il risultato di parit giusto domani abbiamo la possibilit di vincere il torneo cerchiamo di imporci nella nostra partita contro lajax senza curarci del risultato della partita tra arsenal e siviglia rispetto alla gara con il bayern monaco abbiamo giocato 15 metri pi avanti contro lajax dovremo giocare altri 10 metri pi avanti e contro il benfica altri 5 metri fino ad arrivare dove voglio io
2421024 sono molto contento per il rientro di ibrahimovic zlatan un giocatore di classe superiore agli altri certe giocate riescono solo a lui e queste alcune volte fanno la differenza domani credo che giocher 45 minuti importante che migliori e che riprenda il ritmo partita speriamo che possa giocare un po di pi a lisbona con il benfica e che poi sia a disposizione per la supercoppa
2421025 i portieri stanno facendo molto bene silvino ha svolto un buon lavoro ma anche lallenatore dei portieri dello staff di roberto mancini ha svolto un lavoro eccellente sono tutti e tre molto bravi domani sera credo che sar possibile vedere in campo anche paolo orlandoni
2421026 molto buono la condizione generale del gruppo sta crescendo partita dopo partita anche i giocatori che inizialmente hanno patito di pi gli eccessivi carichi di lavoro stanno pian piano entrando in condizione personalmente ho avuto lopportunit di vedere gli azzurri allopera contro i greci del panionios e nonostante la formazione ellenica fosse molto pi avanti con la preparazione la squadra azzurra con cinismo da grande squadra ha centrato lobiettivo qualificazione che rintengo sia la giusta ricompensa a tutta la programmazione fatta dal ds marino in duri anni di lavoro e per i giocatori il giusto premio per avere rinunciato in parte alle proprie vacanze
2421027 negli ultimi mesi il ds marino mi ha chiesto solo ledesma precisamente quattro mesi fa ma la risposta del presidente lotito fu rnegativa il giocatore era ed attualmente ritenuto incedibile dal club laziale prima dellinteressamento per largentino abbiamo parlato svariate volte di walter lopez terzino con ottimo potenziale del river plate calciatore peraltro dotato di passaporto comunitario che potrebbe vestire lazzurro non precludendo larrivo anche di un altro sudamericano non dotato di passaporto europeo ma a quanto pare la dirigenza pare sia interessata a giocatori che negli ultimi tempi sono apparsi sulle pagine dei quotidiani
2421028 assolutamente no il giocatore questanno rimarr a roma come gi ho annunciato nei scorsi mesi il problema con la propriet sorto sulla questione contrattuale tutti sanno il valore di cristian e ricevere una proposta sullingaggio non allaltezza delle sue potenzialit mi sembrata un presa in giro per questo confermo che ledesma nella prossima stagione ricorrer allarticolo 17 che consente al giocatore di poter andare via ma solo per giocare da un campionato diverso da quello del club di appartenenza quindi non escludo lipotesi spagna ma nel calcio mai dire mai
2421029 direi proprio di no i due giocatori per caratteristiche solo molto diversi ledesma oltre ad avere qualche anno pi di esperienza rispetto a
2421030 penso di si sono arrivati sicuramente degli ottimi giocatori maggio e rinaudo gi sono due certezze denis una vera scommessa ma credo che far sicuramente bene quando avr il modo di confrontarsi con lavezzi infine russotto un giovane che conosco benissimo che ha grandi numeri grandi mezzi tecnici e fisici potrebbe essere il giocatore capace di risolvere le partite ormai perse entrando anche negli ultimi minuti un po come faceva robbiati nella fiorentina in definitiva vedo il napoli tra le prime sette sette squadre in serie a
2421031 per etica professionale difficilmente sono incline a fare nomi se proprio dovessi citarne alcuni direi hernandez under 20 uruguay seguito gi da diverse squadre italiane che ritengo in prospettiva un attaccante da doppia cifra per un campionato difficile come quello italiano e poi wellington giovane brasiliano che pare per sia stato acquistato proprio in queste ore dallhoffenheim poteva essere un grandissimo colpo

2421049 the remarkable interest and excitement generated by the registration exercise is an indication of the growing consciousness of ghanaians towards their civil responsibility of voting

2421084 wij hadden wel zenuwen de spelen zijn toch iets speciaals we hebben allebei niet goed geslapen vannacht ik zelfs maar n uurtje maar dat wil ik niet inroepen als excuus eens we op het veld kwamen waren die zenuwen weg we hebben het op het einde van de wedstrijd eigenlijk weggegeven we hebben heel wat stomme foutjes gemaakt en zij moesten het enkel maar afmaken
2421085 we waren nochtans goed begonnen die neiging hebben we altijd maar normaal kunnen we het dan ook vasthouden en deze keer lukte dit niet zij hebben ook een pak meer ervaring wat hier misschien het verschil gemaakt heeft de volgende wedstrijd is tegen de chinezen die zijn heel goed natuurlijk maar ze liggen ons wel en hopelijk hebben ze voor eigen publiek ook zenuwen
2421086 het toernooi is zeker nog niet voorbij voor ons als we tegen de chinezen een set pakken of zelfs de wedstrijd winnen en we winnen tegen de zwitsers dan zijn we er nog bij alleen jammer dat we vandaag geen set hebben kunnen winnen
2421087 dit is niet het sterkste team in onze groep maar we hebben wel altijd problemen met hen ze hebben dit keer ook een aantal dingen anders gedaan in hun verdediging dan normaal we hebben alles gedaan wat we konden en we hebben veel kansen gehad maar ze niet afgemaakt op een toernooi als de spelen is dat fataal natuurlijk

2421195 they are very experienced and they know what theyre dealing with
2421196 once the dogs pick up the scent theyre trained to smell for cash and animal derived products as well the officers will check and x ray the goods
2421197 were looking for illegal drugs excise goods such as cigarettes meat and diary product from non eu countries weapons and pornography
2421198 we make seizures every day but not necessarily of drugs id say we make regular drugs seizures but couldnt go any further than that some weeks theyll be two or three others none at all
2421199 it all started with a conversation in a pub i was chatting to a pal about the first world war and it got on to the fact that i didnt even know my great grandfathers name
2421200 the initial part of research was quite easy with modern computer records but then it started to get a bit more difficult
2421201 i made extensive use of the internet however and managed to hit on family trees that other branches of the family had already researched which finally led me to make contact with relatives in the states
2421202 apparently three of his sons later made the journey to america to join him but when in 1853 william was on his way to salt lake city to meet them he was ambushed and killed by indians as they camped for the night
2421203 it seems that there had been something of a war going on between settlers and local indians and that he set out with three companions against all good advice
2421204 the location of his grave remains unknown but in 2006 a memorial was laid to his memory in his adopted city and william is also honoured as a utah pioneer in a memorial in manti
2421205 after his death williams three sons inherited whatever he had settled there and began families and their descendants are living in and around utah to this day
2421206 it was a tragic story not least because old letters unearthed in a trunk revealed that williams wife though clearly keen to see her children do well had been very fearful about her husband sailing to america
2421207 a year earlier one of her own brothers had died of cholera making the trip across the atlantic and later when two more decided to emigrate to new zealand another died of the same disease
2421208 i travelled out to utah two years ago and met up with a bunch of relatives
2421209 the full impact is still not clear and that is why we have asked for a more detailed report the situation is a moveable feast as after going up tremendously fuel costs have shown some indication of settling down at this stage it is too early to say whether we would require extra money from taxpayers
2421210 every year we budget for possible inflationary increases for pay and non pay costs as each year progresses these estimates are closely monitored and revised in line with the emerging picture
2421211 recent increases in petrol and diesel costs have required us to re calculate what we are likely to spend on motor fuel in the current financial year
2421212 using current prices we initially estimate we may have to spend an extra 1m for petrol and diesel for the 2008 09 financial year above our original calculations and are now working to produce a more detailed estimate
2421213 last year we spent 636 000 on diesel which all of our vehicles use so far for the current financial year we have budgeted to spend an extra 159 000 a 25 per cent increase based on current prices
2421214 but the situation is being monitored weekly because of the fluctuating nature of fuel prices
2421215 the rising cost of fuel is undoubtedly a cost pressure on the service and it is purchased in the most cost effective manner
2421216 every year the trust sets a reserve with regards to what is expected within its budget the trust manages its financial situation based around what cost pressures are prevailing at the time and takes inflation into consideration
2421217 the budget for fuel for this financial year has been increased by 1 2m raising the budget for the whole of the north west to 5 6m
2421218 the increase in fuel costs is monitored on a monthly basis and this figure could change once again
2421219 we have had just eight days in august and it looks like most of the areas rainfall amounts are about half of the monthly average and july was pretty good although some places did miss out
2421220 some places like ceduna and the eyre peninsula will suffer

2421224 the real confidence booster was that check swing hit off brad lidge in the 10th inning
2421225 hes always been a very aggressive hitter opposing pitchers are not giving him a lot of great pitches to hit and he needs to make adjustments to lay off those pitches
2421226 weve talked to him about that its a process hes a very aggressive hitter he loves to swing the bat sometimes that will hurt you more than help you because you try to do too much
2421227 hes got to start learning how to manage the strike zone manage his at bats be a little more in control of what hes trying to do you dont want to take away the aggressiveness you want him to be aggressive but under control put himself in a better position to be aggressive
2421228 were all about aggressiveness were all about swinging the bat with a purpose right now hes not quite there hes taking aggressive swings at too many pitches
2421229 it was a big hit for me and the team
2421230 it just wasnt a real great night for him to pitch
2421231 it was like it was meant for us not to score
2421232 if that ball gets through its a tie game moss made an aggressive play and he didnt panic and just got up and fired the ball

2421242 were not rich and it was money we probably didnt have but we all had to be there
2421243 so we shopped around and eventually paid over 3 000 for flights for six of us including aarons brother and a family friend at u can travel on edge lane in droylsden
2421244 everything seemed to be above board and we were told that wed get the tickets two weeks before departure date
2421245 eventually we spoke to air france and klm who we thought we were travelling with they said the seats had been held but they had never been issued and so the booking had expired and was worthless
2421246 we cant really afford to go and the prices are really high
2421247 the btcb didnt want to cause the lads out there any un necessary stress so they stepped in and sorted new tickets for us all to go out there the lads expect us to be there watching them and no one wants their performances to be affected by our absence
2421248 we are really grateful for their help because without this we would not be going but we will still have to bear the financial burden when we get home
2421249 they have other branches but weve tried them and there is no answer

2421263 it created a little bit of a problem for me because my bosses almost had a heart attack
2421264 we were so close to signing it wouldnt have made any difference im a man of my word and i had shaken hands with them i was not going to back down from that
2421265 it might have taken us until monday to sign the deal without the news report but i dont think so it shook everyone up and we were like lets stop this rumor before it goes crazy it might have sped it up but it didnt change anything
2421266 theres a few drivers id like to work with and tk is definitely on the list
2421267 hes on the throttle the whole time and very aggressive i definitely could have learned a few things from him
2421268 dan was definitely quicker than we were in 06 and we were even in 07 and now were a little better this year
2421269 whatever gets you through the night is alright is alright

2421271 we have experience with shaun and alex in game situations and we do not have that experience with j t osullivan
2421272 well know more of a time scale when he sees our doctors but its not a good situation it kind of puts a damper on things i know how much he wanted to get back and was very excited about finally feeling healthy
2421273 i feel really bad for him its one of those crazy things hit in the foot by a line drive well just let the doctors look at him and see where we go from here
2421274 he seems to think hell be able to start activity next week and go from there hell be in a splint for another week and start working out with us and start taking batting practice next week right now everything is good
2421275 he really believes he can play right handed right now
2421276 i wouldnt be afraid to do that whether we will nor not i dont know

2421281 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2421282 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2421283 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2421284 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2421285 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2421286 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2421287 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2421288 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2421289 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2421290 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2421291 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2421292 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2421403 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2421404 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs

2421414 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2421415 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2421416 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2421417 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2421426 im still kind of shocked and surprised to be honest with you he just never came across as the type of person that could do something like that he was a nice guy
2421427 he was there every day he did a good job was friendly and really we had no problems with this individual at all
2421428 she mentioned that hed had an emergency he had to go out of town and that she wasnt sure where he went and wasnt sure if hed be back the following morning to deliver his newspapers
2421429 its early and i think the judge just wants to respect his rights to speak to counsel and hes giving him that opportunity
2421430 i dont think it will be very long that theyll allow him to do that
2421431 he has a lot of friends and they all are very upset hes gone and they would like to say they miss him and he will always be in their hearts
2421432 the rcmp are mindful of the range of emotions being experienced by the family of the deceased over the loss of their loved one in such a horrific incident our thoughts are with them
2421433 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
2421434 god hates you and its because of your rebellion against his word that this child is dead
2421435 is it legal to have abortions up there they are teaching you that god is a big fat liar by making sins legal
2421436 that is so dishonouring to tim mcleans family its a slap in the face
2421437 the main purpose in life is to love god and to love one another i dont know how this falls into that definition
2421438 lo and behold we were going to canada and god offered us a gift the curse of god was put upon you canada when that young mans head was cut off
2421439 that runs absolutely contrary to what is taught in the bible
2421440 god loves all people that is 100 per cent true god will love us no matter how far from we stray from things who are they to judge

2421488 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2421489 the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2421490 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2421491 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2421492 well ill take your g fs suitcase back and get 20 bottles of the stuff you ungrateful pompous
2421493 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2421494 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2421495 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2421496 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2421497 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2421498 there are still four days before my next competition which enables me to adjust myself
2421499 we were not planning to protest at first as we didnt want to upset the horses or the crowd
2421500 we just wanted to hold up the tibetan flag and show our support for them but as soon as we lifted it up the security guards jumped on us and dragged us out of the arena
2421501 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2421502 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2421503 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud
2421504 so many people expect us to get gold medals and its really a great pressure for us
2421505 sometimes i feel its hard to breathe or even cry under the pressure but once the competition begins i will think nothing and just strive for my best
2421506 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2421507 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2421508 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2421509 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2421510 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2421511 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2421512 we continue to be candid about our belief that all people should have the freedom to say what they think and worship as they choose
2421513 its nonsense to suggest that visiting leaders are endorsing the communist party by attending the ceremony
2421514 whether they are critical or appreciative foreign leaders recognise that china is a very important nation even if heads of state have a negative opinion of chinas domestic policies they come to pay respect not just to the government but to the people western leaders come here to meet and talk with chinas leaders because thats the best way to influence them
2421515 the olympics are the opportunity to accompany china on a path toward openness tolerance progress and the respect of our values
2421516 tonight the olympics will open but i am under even tighter surveillance than usual because of it there are over 40 people watching me in two shifts and i am only allowed out to buy groceries
2421517 i hope the olympics will be a success so that afterwards there will be more democracy and freedom
2421518 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2421519 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2421520 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2421521 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2421522 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2421523 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2421524 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2421525 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2421526 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2421527 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2421528 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2421529 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2421530 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2421531 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2421532 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2421533 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2421534 who are open to doing something on the production side
2421535 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2421536 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2421537 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2421538 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2421539 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2421540 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2421541 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2421542 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2421543 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2421544 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2421545 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2421546 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2421547 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2421548 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2421549 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2421550 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2421551 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2421552 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2421553 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2421554 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2421555 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2421556 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2421557 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2421558 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2421559 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2421560 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2421561 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2421562 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2421563 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2421564 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2421565 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2421566 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2421567 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2421568 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2421569 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2421570 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2421571 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2421572 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2421573 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2421574 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2421575 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2421576 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2421577 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2421578 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2421579 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2421580 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2421581 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2421582 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2421583 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2421584 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2421585 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2421586 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2421587 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2421588 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2421589 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2421590 adriaan de jonges article xforms vs ruby on rails has created quite a stir in both the xml and ruby communities and for good reason he asked a fairly important question are xforms an also ran technology that ruby has managed to supplant
2421591 my quibble with the argument is that to me ruby is an apple xforms an orange or perhaps more accurately ruby is a framework xforms is a systems component
2421592 regardless of whether you are working with xforms or ruby or asp net your data models are likely to be considerably more complex than a single stream of static xml
2421593 the xforms architecture pushes the level of abstraction up a level in this case the components that you interact with on the page are not actually involved in maintaining the data model only in changing it this is a subtle distinction but an important one
2421594 this is actually a pretty profound expression of model view controller architecture
2421595 xforms is useless for a fair number of web development tasks
2421596 xforms applications are most likely going to be utilized precisely in those areas where ruby wont be
2421597 where xforms comes into its own is when youre dealing with data lots and lots of data
2421598 most of the clients that i deal with when building xforms applications are not in fact looking at building another community site
2421599 i personally think that the days of shrink wrapped software are history
2421600 increasingly software is becoming oriented towards helping people with lots and lots of data get at that data more effectively
2421601 it actually works better in conjunction with something else which i am increasingly coming to believe is an web enabled xml database working with either xquery or xslt preferably both
2421602 xforms has taken off in those places where its most suited and this even before theres a native version of xforms sitting in a browser
2421603 id far more like to see xforms and ruby on rails rather than xforms vs ruby and i suspect so would your customers
2421604 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2421605 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2421606 we have to refashion what our web prescence is it cant just be what it too often is today a bland repurposing of our print content
2421607 more importantly better quality reporting had attracted more readers viewers and web users that in turn had attracted new advertisers and over us3 million in advertising revenue
2421608 in this case the learned primary judge did not avert to the possibility that any adverse effect of pretrial publicity might be dissipated by an adjournment of the trial for a few months
2421609 a paintball manufacturer and advocate for women are expressing outrage that a las vegas company claims to be charging men up to 10 000 to use the non lethal but dangerous weapons to shoot naked women racing through the sagebrush but a creator of the
2421610 we dont really sleep at night because we always have to hear for the color red announcement in a car you dont wear a seat belt you dont put on the radio you have the windows down so you can hear it
2421611 we can give these kids a sense of normalcy for a few weeks to get away from the disruptiveness of their lives and were hoping it will pique an interest in our teens to visit israel
2421612 we were talking about their boyfriends and how theyre chamud
2421613 they want to call home every day but if they call every day they wont enjoy this place

2421619 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2421620 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2421621 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2421622 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2421623 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2421624 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2421625 most of the people didnt really know about the possibility that you can transfer your contract to someone else
2421626 it was a lifesaver or else id be out 250 in termination fees
2421627 at first i did not think that anyone would ever contact me to take over my contract
2421628 i was locked into a two year contract and the cancellation fees were like 200
2421629 before no one had anyone to ask to take over their contracts
2421630 it is kind of buyer beware because some sellers are selling plans that are too good to be true
2421631 the floodgates might open when the first bishop goes to jail and when he goes to jail not for his own misbehavior but for abetting the misbehavior of others
2421632 the light of our faith in the darkest of times

2421634 it kind of gets your attention when someone files a lien against your house
2421635 it was most of them it was at least two thirds of them
2421636 the psychiatrists on whom the bishops were relying when they pronounced someone healed and ready to go to go back into ministry those psychiatrists are still consulting with the bishops theyre consulting with them among other things on the programs that are being put in place allegedly to safeguard children let me tell you something those programs are not safeguarding children theyre safeguarding insurance companies those programs are making the children better witnesses if theyre molested
2421637 the people who were acting as gatekeepers in the seminaries and then acting as gatekeepers in the other way swinging open the gates in these treatment places for troubled priests these people have to be brought to account they cannot be allowed to continue doing their damage
2421638 its ancient knowledge that we lost and we lost deliberately because we went after human respect we went after the psychologists with the secular credentials with degrees from harvard rather than notre dame
2421639 i personally think theres something in the order of blackmail happening
2421640 you might have said 20 years ago that there was a conspiracy at st vincents church in manhattan to promote the homosexual agenda well now the parish marches in the gay pride parade thats not a conspiracy thats open rebellion
2421641 we need to be telling people in power as respectfully and charitably as we can that we cannot tolerate people who are working for the other side under the guise of the catholic church
2421642 and the pattern was one of ignoring the problems as they festered of denying the evil of the problem when the evidence was transparently before them
2421643 times there were liturgical abuses and they were presented to the bishops and the bishops said to the complaintants youre the problem because you see a problem with the liturgy
2421644 you complain about sex education in catholic schools and youre told you are being divisive and you realize what the word divisive means is making waves
2421645 they put out a statement a couple of hours before the vote obviously for the public record and not for the purpose of influencing votes
2421646 every member of the knights of columbus in the state senate voted for that every member of the hibernians voted for it we can no longer count on any sort of institutional catholic support
2421647 so that wed be more comfortable so that wed have more power so that wed be able to make more deals so that wed be viewed with the respect that would give us status and now look what weve wrought
2421648 catholics in the course of a century took every institution in massachusetts from a hostile majority
2421649 okay so we did it once we can do it again
2421650 we hold that the diocese is not responsible for criminal acts committed by a priest employee outside the scope of his employment the same as any employer would not be responsible for the actions of an employee outside the scope of his employment
2421651 i really feel brown will do more harm than good for the church
2421652 no one came forward with specific allegations until that time
2421653 its about winning the gold medal she went over there for one reason thats to get the gold in the time trial

2421659 on any course kristin is going to be top five
2421660 in the olympics unless you end up with the gold medal or silver or bronze thats good too nobody remembers you ask anyone what place i got in athens and no one remembers if youre fourth no one remembers
2421661 what the hell is he talking about snow angels in september for
2421662 this is not about a tiny separatist area inside georgia this is not about georgia anymore it is about america its values
2421663 the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2421664 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2421665 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2421666 if this will not be settled the impact would be around p18 per kwh without the net settlement surplus or p8 76 per kwh with the net settlement surplus these are not final figures as we are still discussing and recalculating these can either be adjusted to a lower price or pegged on the national power corp time of use rates

2421685 i am extremely concerned about the allegation of illegal drug use by assessor bill postmus
2421686 i call on the assessor to publicly and personally refute this allegation if it is untrue otherwise the assessor should resign his post immediately
2421687 it gives them more self esteem it gives you more confidence
2421688 publicly and personally refute this allegation if it is untrue otherwise the assessor should resign his post today
2421689 assessor postmus has no comment on either the story that was published today in an area newspaper and he has no comment on chair paul bianes statement that was issued today

2421695 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2421696 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2421697 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2421698 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2421699 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2421700 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him

2421783 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2421784 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2421785 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2421786 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2421787 sono passati 52 anni ma la sicurezza nei posti del lavoro non ancora garantita come ci dimostrano le tragedie della thyssen e le troppe morti bianche
2421788 se est violando la ley con tal de apoyar proyectos que son contaminantes no hay respeto hacia la gente
2421789 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2421790 another three died in overnight attacks altogether 15 peacekeepers have been killed
2421791 het is een doosje waarin een mosselmaaltijd zit zonder de mosselen en de verse groenten

2421793 it is the united states that is to lead the world to our lady of kibeho
2421794 in the mekong delta southern vietnam you eat a lot of snake gecko and turtle
2421795 cobra is a favourite the blood is served with rice wine the heart you knock back in one while still beating bang bang and the meat is served both grilled and as a soup
2421796 you can have a one hour massage for us 45 24 vietnam is the best value in south east asia and we have a 600 metre beach
2421797 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2421798 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2421799 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2421800 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2421801 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2421802 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2421803 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2421804 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2421805 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2421806 yes this day has special meaning for us because we are chinese
2421807 and the shape also symbolizes eternity so we wanted to take some of the chinese luck
2421808 he wanted the wedding today because there are three eights in the day and its easy to memorize

2421811 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace they are also responsible for protecting the population
2421812 uttering just a few phrases through clenched teeth putin reminded investors of the risk threatening any investment in russia
2421813 the mechel case shows that ex president putin who formally resigned in may is still the man whose speech is listened to by foreign investors
2421814 putin talks investors listen and medvedev does nothing despite an earlier promise to refrain from interfering with the economy and to prove that russia is friendly towards investors
2421815 the soviet regime fell into oblivion but the russian authorities collusion with hypocrisy and violence continues to exist in different forms making solzhenitsyns slogan as vital as ever
2421816 russia is worried about military threats feeling as though it is surrounded by enemies who plan to subdue the country economically politically militarily and geographically russian leaders have always used the image of a foreign enemy to strengthen authoritarian rule today its nato again just as in the soviet era
2421817 it was not by accident that using offshore zones for price setting has been raised again in 2007 the probable effects of raising taxes on the metallurgical industry were researched perhaps it was an attempt to find ways to compensate for cutting the value added tax and oil industry levies russia currently has three candidates for additional taxation the timber industry which is difficult to manage because it comprises too many players gas but gazprom is too important a player to be affected and metallurgy
2421818 scientists of tartu university attempted to find out if the so called
2421819 solzhenitsyn paid attention to lithuanians he used his foundations to provide aid to residents of kaunas who participated in the human rights movement and the lithuanian helsinki groups activities
2421820 this action was not prompted by the belarusian government but by the belarusian leader
2421821 russia has been aggressively pragmatic in bilateral economic relations lately but in attitude russia is closer to the belarusian leaders than the western countries with their constant demands for democracy and human rights choosing the eastern contractor though will deprive belarus of a chance to build a bridge to europe
2421822 ukrainian and russian politicians have hit upon another excuse to stage a petty row moscow has set in motion its entire inventory of measures from a raid by radicals on the ukrainian embassy in moscow to a foreign ministry statement that kiev is disrespectful to russian clergy until kiev and moscow agree on supplies and transit of russian hydrocarbons politicians will find dozens of reasons for violent public quarrels
2421823 the prospects for integration are linked not only with partner and allied relations with the member states of these international alliances but also with russias policy of neo imperialism or revenge seeking
2421824 moscow has been able to create a super network of agents which feeds russias influence on ukraines political process and personnel policy this system is powerful enough to drastically review ukraines foreign policy this has led to a paralysis of ukraines euro atlantic integration policy
2421825 de jure ukraine is a sovereign state but in political reality it is not all key decisions are taken in the washington politburo all basic problems nato a common economic space with russia the status of the russian language and orthodox unity between russian and ukrainian believers have two perspectives one shared by the ukrainian people and the other by the washington politburo and on all these issues the ukrainian president sides with the washington politburo rather than the people
2421826 protests staged by separatists in komrat have been inspired by moscow and camouflaged with anti communist slogans their aims are to foment antagonistic feelings between the ruling communist party and separatist leaders put greater pressure on the authorities and exploit the situation for further talks on the transdnestr issue
2421827 there is a view that the holding will exert its best efforts to make all cis countries in the next two to three years switch to world prices for gas supplied to them leaving transportation charges as they are gazprom is forcing the changeover to market prices with all its partners that have enjoyed reduced rates until now the countries which pump gas to european consumers ukraine and belarus are at an advantage compared with other cis neighbors because they can dictate their terms to gazprom armenia is more handicapped in its bargaining the country has no transit pipelines and a considerable part of the armenian assets of most interest to gazprom and russian capital has already changed hands and is controlled by russian companies
2421828 among all countries russia is currently in the biggest deadlock russias officials cannot simultaneously accept the independence of ossetia and abkhazia and speak on the status of kosovo since they are perfectly aware that this will work against them they cannot start negotiations with georgia on returning these territories south ossetia and abkhazia to russia which would not be an ideal way out but would perfectly help to buy time for russia in that case georgias president mikheil saakashvili would have nothing to do but give up the territories which will certainly not satisfy him so it will lead to war in some form or another
2421829 russia is enjoying a cash cow period with unfavorable times having changed for the better thanks to world prices for energy resources
2421830 the idea is that such a defense alliance would become a substitute for nato which would eliminate the major discrepancy in current relations between russia and the west the biggest problem is the western countries refusal to cooperate with russia on reconsidering the global security system after the u s s r s collapse now with the russian economy having revived after the chaos of the 1990s moscow is seeking new ways of exerting its clout russia is viewing itself as the biggest country which has managed to become a bridge between europe and asia and has enough strength and abilities to win a global influence
2421831 moscow says it intends to humanize its policy in some way but actually the kremlin is only changing its mask and this is not promising anything good
2421832 astana is supporting the united states on all major international issues
2421833 a preventive call from the kremlin has resulted in a top level meeting involving the head of the russian gas giant who has not received any invitations to the presidential palace in ashgabat lately at the end of the past week the turkmen president gurbanguly berdymukhammedov and russias gazprom ceo alexei miller have agreed on the principles of price formation for turkmen gas with the turkmen side proposing the scheme of sale and purchase for its gas moscow wants russias oil and gas giant to monopolize all turkmen gas exported to the north which lets ashgabat set its own terms that the kremlin has to take into consideration the turkmen presidents likable and seemingly promising smile is nothing but a feature of top level diplomacy hiding a solid intention to pursue his own interests

2421835 the occurrence of events that happen at the same time by accident but seem to have some connection
2421836 it was decided the most expedient thing to do was for the vessel to get to tilbury and have facilities waiting for them
2421837 after a great deal of consideration and consultation with local people with tesco management and with essex county councils built environment team i have come to the conclusion that the proposed development is simply not in keeping with the historic unspoilt town of manningtree
2421838 we cannot have an out of town superstore plan dumped on the end of manningtree high street but that is all that tesco is currently offering
2421839 this is a once in a generation chance to shape the built environment of manningtree for the better
2421840 it gives a great boost to our campaign to have this sort of opinion come through now we knew that it was going to be difficult for him to come out before he had the chance to hear what the people of the town were saying
2421841 this would serve as a barrier to the town rather than a gateway as tesco claims
2421842 what was agreed was that the county council would come back to us with their thoughts after which we agreed we would sit down to discuss these issues and thus far we havent received any drawings from them
2421843 we are willing to discuss the issues that mr jenkin has raised
2421844 het was onze bedoeling om via deze promotiecampagne op te vallen blijkbaar is dat goed gelukt trouwens van klachten zou ik niet spreken het gaat meer om negatieve reacties van mensen die nu eenmaal graag overal kritiek op hebben
2421845 goed er zijn ook wat reacties gekomen van mensen die het financieel moeilijk hebben en door de brief geschrokken zijn die mensen hebben we met de nodige excuses duidelijk gemaakt dat het niet om een echte aanmaning ging

2421860 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2421861 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2421862 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2421863 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2421864 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2421865 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2421866 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2421867 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2421868 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2421869 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth

2421893 i think there are a lot of democrats who are nervous
2421894 i think they thought this election would fall into their laps
2421895 i predict that will be translate into a vote for obama
2421896 any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics sex or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement

2421898 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today
2421899 in that building existed little more than a bunch of companies which
2421900 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
2421901 there was no significant loss of life in those towers their own evil

2421907 she was unsteady on her feet her eyes were glazed and i formed the opinion that she was drunk while speaking with her she said the child in the pushchair was hers
2421908 she told me she was out in the town celebrating her birthday but she wasnt drunk she started to get aggressive in her manner so she was arrested
2421909 she was quite stroppy in her manner and she said she was taking the child home she was unsteady on her feet her speech was slurred and i could smell alcohol on her breath
2421910 i know when i am drunk because i feel sick and tired
2421911 a member of the public contacted the council offices to advise someone was strimming grass on simpasture walk and was cutting newly planted hedging
2421912 this was immediately investigated and found to be a probation service work team
2421913 while the council had given permission for litterpicking and strimming in 2004 we were not aware of current operations in the location
2421914 fortunately the intervention of the member of the public stopped further damage hopefully there may be regrowth if not some replanting may be required
2421915 the area that was strimmed was in an area that was overgrown with grass and we did not know it had been planted at the time the supervisor apologised and we offer our apologies again
2421916 we work throughout county durham for a lot of different local authorities effectively doing this kind of work
2421917 she loved it and wanted to go back the next day she was strong and she could do it
2421918 the club captain wanted jess and her sister because they had the aptitude and with them being twins he knew they would form a crew because in rowing you need to be there at the same time and getting everyone there at the same time can be difficult
2421919 the first time they were selected to represent the country we got a letter in the post that said both had been selected to row for great britain in nantes in france
2421920 it said please send a cheque for 400 each and have your boat in london at 9am on monday morning
2421921 we ended up having our summer holidays wherever they were competing
2421922 we did not know what we were going to do but we had the most wonderful time
2421923 we are all very excited we had to take a chance and book it a year ago without knowing whether she was in
2421924 we would never have got anywhere to stay if we had left it
2421925 we have paid five times the normal price to rent an apartment for two weeks
2421926 it will be worth it though especially if she comes back with a gold medal
2421927 ive learnt a lot about myself some of it good some of it bad climbing is my demon but it is also my cure
2421928 ian was an experienced climber and was emerging as a talented alpinist
2421929 he had a bright future at university ahead of him his eternal optimism and complete lack of ego will be a great loss to the climbing community
2421930 of course i am worried about him but franco and his climbing friends are unstoppable franco said that if he returns now he might never climb again
2421931 ian franco and the other climbers on the trip are very mature
2421932 there are always risks but ian was experienced and he knew what those risks were
2421933 ian was a very athletic 19 year old who was not into drinking or smoking he was just a lovely young man who would not cause any harm to anyone this is tragic
2421934 the three day festival includes something for everyone with concerts ceilidhs outdoor events and sessions across durham with a wealth of talent drawn from the folkworks summer schools and beyond
2421935 we are travelling without a political religious or social agenda
2421936 the whole thing started nearly four years ago as students at cambridge there was a bunch of us wanting to do this journey and write a book about it
2421937 then a producer became involved and the idea of a television series came about
2421938 i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2421939 especially since its the first gold medal of the olympics i feel amazing
2421940 as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2421941 im more proud of her than if i was to do it myself
2421942 i did my part i mean half of my job is done
2421943 i know i would do good even if he wasnt here if he couldnt be here for some reason i know he would do great if i wasnt here for him
2421944 the second set was probably the best set ive played in the last four months or so
2421945 it just clicked in and the ball started doing what i wanted
2421946 this is probably as optimistic as ive been after match in quite awhile
2421947 i felt like i could get some serious matches under my belt and its a tournament i felt i could win
2421948 that 1 0 game was big having a break and being up 40 15 and losing that
2421949 i felt like mentally he was almost ready to check out if i had won that game
2421950 and when he broke my serve in the seventh game of the first set i started playing much better after that i played very good
2421951 okay whats coming up that you should be planning for
2421952 hi i am calling to let you know that david is up and walking around
2421953 you just told me that he is fine you tell me do i need to speak to a priest

2421957 i ll be making up for lost time since the food was fantastic service very good and athmosphere was wonderful
2421958 this restaurant is little secret in the northwestern suburbs that you should try if you like indian nepalese food very interesting and tasty dishes
2421959 an extensive menu offers many mouth watering delicacies most of them not vegan friendly and some dishes especially crispy pata require manual dexterity
2421960 burgers are really good so is the beef and combos polish is good too pasta taste great too just too much sauce get it on the side
2421961 mediocre food mediocre service there are better greek restaurants to be had in chicago
2421962 the food is very good and the service is nice too
2421963 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2421964 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best maybe half of the team dont have that mentality
2421965 the addition of manny and now of penny is a big lift for us

2421972 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2421973 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud
2421974 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
2421975 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
2421976 i felt really awkward the first couple of at bats really from both sides but it came back quick
2421977 i was feeling very rusty early on that is to be expected going 15 days without seeing a pitch and no rehab i didnt expect to be right on but it came back pretty quick
2421978 so many people expect us to get gold medals and its really a great pressure for us
2421979 sometimes i feel its hard to breathe or even cry under the pressure but once the competition begins i will think nothing and just strive for my best
2421980 we were not planning to protest at first as we didnt want to upset the horses or the crowd
2421981 we just wanted to hold up the tibetan flag and show our support for them but as soon as we lifted it up the security guards jumped on us and dragged us out of the arena
2421982 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2421983 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2421984 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo

2422003 i need a holiday im going to call in a few favours and ask the others to cover for me
2422004 you have to put your cards on the table and tell her that you want a pay rise
2422005 when there are arguments she just sits on the fence and says nothing
2422006 when he was taken on sarah took him under her wing
2422007 my predecessor showed me the ropes so i felt quite confident
2422008 he was thrown in at the deep end with his new job no one helped him at all
2422009 the atmosphere between the two departments is terrible theres a real them and us situation
2422010 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2422011 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2422012 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2422013 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2422014 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2422015 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2422016 those who take the first step and sign up for individual welfare reform would then be provided with the four other steps of opportunity by government and the private sector
2422017 i had a rough month of july so ive been looking to get back on track and try to end the season on a positive note
2422018 i was making some quality pitches consistently throwing good strikes with my fastball
2422019 the umpire made me feel pretty comfortable with the way he expanded the zone
2422020 i dont think it was necessarily fatigue it was a little bit of nerves
2422021 tonight was a pretty peculiar game a lot of times they were getting into fastball counts but they were taking defensive swings maybe it was because i was able to throw some quality breaking balls in those counts
2422022 jake fox is hot right now and hes a good hitter
2422023 i thought if i got past him id have a chance to do it
2422024 i was sitting there kind of replaying some things in my mind
2422025 i snapped back to reality when the bases got full
2422026 the main thing is you cant sit there on dwell on the perfect game because we have to focus on winning the game

2422084 its funny i see them the nigerians around the hotel and i remember them from that great game
2422085 during our game here it was all business but after the whistle it was like a reunion with us all shaking hands and exchanging some memories of that game in kerkrade in 2005
2422086 the draw was not the worst result in the world but i think we can play better than we did that day
2422087 the draw was probably a fair result but well be hoping to get the goals going when we meet the americans
2422088 they are good but i think we match up against their direct style more than we do against the technical creative style of nigeria
2422089 if we keep the ball on the ground and get it moving around i think well be ok

2422094 everyone loves a rebel and their mystique only adds to the attraction
2422095 and these artists share a political edge and a wry sense of humour which appeals to a new generation of collectors
2422096 if you work in this world you probably like taking risks but youre still part of the establishment its quite conservative you cant rebel at work but you can buy rebellious art thats shocking or subversive

2422105 we just couldnt get anything generated offensively we had a few penalties and a lot of third and long situations

2422126 how many variations are there of we meet again dr jones
2422127 in 1985 when i became one of the artists in residence at the national museum of science and technology in ottawa i dreamt up this project about a chair that would fall apart and put itself back together again
2422128 i wanted my chair to be very generic and yet i wanted it to have this capacity to fall apart and put itself back together
2422129 because its outside of what we normally know i think everyone has come at the chair with a particularly interesting take kids cry in front of it people applaud it people laugh at it people are cynical about it theres such a range of emotions that go on in front of this thing that its been overwhelming i thought i was making a sculpture and i realize that we have created a performer
2422130 i still have my accent but i feel much more free now
2422131 we can do this if you want but i trust where youre going with the character
2422132 there are still people who think olney is a community theater
2422133 how can a professional theater be plunked down in the middle of this place it doesnt make any sense
2422134 and i guess it really doesnt it makes no sense whatsoever
2422135 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2422136 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2422137 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2422138 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2422141 im not too upset about it what was it a bunch of singles and three doubles im just not real upset about it im just going to move on and ive already done that
2422142 youve got to get better the next start hes got some work to do and well get him ready
2422143 he got behind in some counts and they made him pay
2422144 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2422145 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2422146 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2422147 im not sure i had a political career for the future any way and im not sure politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2422148 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2422149 believes he should stand alone when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him

2422152 it establishes western washington as a national leader in protecting water quality and building responsibly
2422153 its a national precedent its the first time a hearings board anywhere in the country has said that low impact development techniques will be required
2422154 to make low impact development work we have to remove the regulatory barriers to it create incentives for builders to use it and educate the public about the features they could use
2422155 it depends on how you interpret the language the board gave us
2422156 that can mean very different things depending on what someone wants it to mean
2422157 the biological health of puget sound is declining and a major cause of the decline is stormwater runoff
2422158 this decline carries with it a variety of environmental economic and social costs
2422159 the costs associated with navigating a system of land use regulation and development that was not created with low impact development in mind
2422160 the feedback weve been getting from developers and people involved in the business is it may not work every place every time everywhere and there has to be some flexibility
2422161 we recognize there could be sites where it is infeasible to use low impact development
2422162 its our hope were going to see a new way of doing business a new way of development its the kind of green building that a lot of consumers are asking for
2422163 the city of seattle has been and remains deeply committed to low impact development we are arguably as invested in that as any other city in the nation
2422164 our main interest in intervening in this process was to make sure the board had all the information it needed
2422165 were going to take them at their word that they care about this problem and are going to be using the most effective approaches to solve it
2422166 and well be watching to make sure they do that
2422167 so long as these applications are not pending no city permits are required for removal of the trees
2422168 this is just a schoolyard bully here theyve shown their true colors
2422169 its really shocking that they would go through this type of maneuver
2422170 is deeply disappointed in the decision by seattle public schools to cut trees at ingraham high school without further city review or public input
2422171 the school district should stay within the regulatory process and act in good faith
2422172 we expect good stewardship of our trees from all our residents and from the school district
2422173 its out of safety concerns for the students we need to do this when school is not in session and when its not during the wet weather season

2422210 the complete ceo is a fascinating book while it wont turn the average ceo into warren buffett it does contain a wealth of uncommon common sense wisdom which will take him or her a number of steps in his direction
2422211 the ultimate test of a ceo is value creation yet few are prepared for the task this book will be of practical help to anyone who seriously takes up this challenge
2422212 i believe that the high performance model described in this book will be of value to any business leader but especially to one new in post or one who has good reason to introduce change
2422213 the high performance model at the core of the book moves from a clear and insightful discussion of what drives the creation and maintenance of a winning business model into a decomposition of the role of the ceo the authors have worked with a number of highly successful ceos and former ceos to understand the essence of their success and the actions they have taken day to day to drive it and the result is a practical easy to understand guide

2422231 because of this change in policy i decided to purchase a family membership in order to support the museum both with my artistic energy and financially i was excited to begin spending regular time exploring and documenting the museum unfortunately i should have known better than to really believe that the san francisco moma was serious about opening up the art and architecture entrusted to them to the general public after purchasing my family membership and visiting the museum today i was forcibly thrown out of the museum by two museum security guards at the direction of the director of visitor relations simon blint my crime taking a photograph from the second floor stairs in the sfmomas atrium an area where the sf momas own website explicitly says photography is allowed

2422250 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2422251 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2422252 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2422253 det b rjade med att mannens mor var p bes k i sverige sista kv llen hade modern pratat med sonen om hur d liga kvinnor i sverige r som g r som de vill sv rmodern anv nde sonhustrun som exempel d b rjade mannen sl sin hustru en g ng misshandlade han henne s sv rt att han h ll p att strypa henne hon hamnade p sjukhus efter upprepade br k d mannen ocks stulit d ttrarnas pengar separerade makarna
2422254 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2422255 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2422256 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2422257 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2422258 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2422259 our goal is to ask what benefits can we get out of this technology and how can we protect peoples privacy at the same time
2422260 we want to get a handle on the issues that would crop up if these systems become a reality
2422261 what if rfid readers were everywhere and everything had rfid tags what are the pluses and minuses what do you do with all that data
2422262 in computer science we try to create a future world that doesnt exist yet wed like to get some experience rather than just conjecture about this
2422263 even if you wanted to study just privacy or just utility youd have to study the other as well
2422264 people are more likely to give out information if theres a benefit to them you cant really separate issues of privacy from issues of utility
2422265 its a perfect memory system that records all your personal interactions throughout the day
2422266 you can go back a day later a month later and see what did i do that day
2422267 we want to observe how a group of people uses these tools whether they find them useful how they adapt them
2422268 we worry that these technologies are being implemented too quickly and with this system we want to explore it in a controlled environment to inform the public and policymakers about issues we might face

2422332 first we would like to know approximately how many hours a week you spend at your job or occupation and that includes keeping house or going to school as well as working for pay or profit
2422333 in general how loyal do you think that companies are to their employees today very loyal fairly loyal just somewhat loyal or not too loyal

2422342 they still think the future of newspapers is bright and demonstrated it by buying the connecticut post i think they employees are excited about the opportunity to work for the hearst corp
2422343 were not about to give up on that who will watch city hall
2422344 so as much as one of the concerns for naysayers was the hospitals arent enrolling just today we signed five
2422345 weve said for the last couple of weeks that its not unusual for there to be time consuming negotiations i think the proof is in the pudding today
2422346 i still think we can take the deep breath im requesting get together and work this thing out
2422347 its not like access to providers under husky right now is or has been perfect
2422348 however at the moment access is in the vicinity of reasonable access to existing provider networks will be largely destroyed in favor of what we know are extremely limited charter oak networks
2422349 our position is the governor needs to put the brakes on this a little bit until were sure kids arent going to be harmed
2422350 i know we want to open as soon as possible with a splash and press coverage but all the pieces have to be in place i dont want to open a program that embarrasses the governor doesnt meet her commitments has fatal flaws at the start and gets shut down due to inadequacies
2422351 this is a very exciting day particularly for the residents
2422352 were off to a great start and its time there are people with chipping ceilings in their rooms

2422354 this decision is a positive move forward on this project
2422355 its going to be hard to administer the school when its spread out to four different locations but what can you do

2422357 closely monitor the progress of the project with the goal of receiving the temporary certificate of occupancy as quickly as possible
2422358 im not going to make an absolute statement about anything
2422359 i cant confirm or deny anything all i can say is were moving ahead with the contingency plan
2422360 for the 31 million dollars plus that the town has spent that building should be sparkling like emerald city by now

2422375 i need not say that i have confirmed it watson
2422376 only that his name is a household word in society
2422377 well i can tell you a little more than that he has rather a reputation for arranging delicate matters which are to be kept out of the papers you may remember his negotiations with sir george lewis over the hammerford will case he is a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy i am bound therefore to hope that it is not a false scent and that he has some real need for our asistance

2422386 our standard nose test and educate the app on how to ventilate the unit for 24 hours then follow up with app to see if that helps
2422387 my eyes started to burn and a headache soon followed
2422388 these data show that both the osha and niosh limits were exceeded
2422389 the agency received multiple warnings about dangerous levels of formaldehyde in fema trailers but refused to conduct testing of occupied trailers because testing would imply femas ownership of the issue
2422390 to be moving forward with plans and consulting with other agencies prior to vetting this internally could seriously undermine the agencys position and that is not acceptable
2422391 theyre not designed for long term use we all know this
2422392 as soon as fema headquarters was made aware of the situation fema began acting accordingly
2422393 to me the effect of what fema has done is taking longer than recovery from the storm
2422394 our informal testing has indicated that formaldehyde levels of indoor ambient air of occupied trailers fall below for instance the osha standard of 75 parts per million
2422395 the problem was and is confusion among government agencies not some conspiracy by trailer manufacturers
2422396 i think when we have to abandon trailers its not just the government that should pay for it
2422397 sierra club began testing fema trailers in march 2006 and immediately found widespread formaldehyde contamination
2422398 the sierra club has received complaints about indoor formaldehyde air contamination from across the country and not just from people in emergency housing
2422399 congress has shown leadership in investigating the formaldehyde tragedy that has left many natural disaster victims facing illnesses at a time when they are still struggling to recover financially from losing everything
2422400 clearly it is far past time for a formaldehyde fix in this country weve known for decades how toxic formaldehyde can be and now it is time to resolve this problem once and for all japan europe and china all have stronger formaldehyde regulations than the u s american families deserve the same protections
2422401 we can take two attitudes in government we can take the attitude that we want to try to look good or we can take the attitude that were here to serve the public
2422402 this not only sets an important precedent for accountability but frankly this congress has a solemn obligation to make sure we get to the bottom of this our job here is to protect the people we serve and not to protect government officials
2422403 the bush administrations response to katrina was not only a logistical failure it was a moral failure
2422404 instead of deploying the resources necessary to save lives and rebuild communities we find another report that the bush administration cut corners and buried the truth this amendment will initiate an investigation into why the administration failed to respond to reports of a toxic gas contaminating fema provided trailers and whether this environmental hazard continues to pose a threat to the victims of katrina
2422405 it shouldnt take an act of congress for fema to act in the best interest of those it should be serving but it has
2422406 i am pleased to join senators mccaskill and obama in moving this matter to the forefront and standing up for the health and welfare of hurricane victims
2422407 we must make sure that disaster victims are safe from deadly carcinogens when they rely on the federal government for temporary housing
2422408 it is gravely troubling that fema would distribute trailers that they knew to have unacceptable levels of formaldehyde this amendment will require a necessary report to determine the health risks in fema trailers so that victims some of whom have lost their homes and all of their possessions are not housed in a trailer that is dangerous to their health
2422409 americans ought to be able to trust that their government wont knowingly expose them to risk
2422410 this amendment will get us the answers we need to determine whether fema exposed evacuees to dangerous toxins
2422411 in march of 2006 i pushed to have these mobile homes put to good use in indian country more than a year after the process started and almost two years after hurricane katrina we find out that the manufacturers built mobile homes and travel trailers that may be toxic fema clearly has a problem with emergency housing they have not addressed this directive will force the agency to take care of the problems before these mobile homes and travel trailers are sent to indian country or future natural disaster victims
2422412 thats the way i see it things are bound to pick up
2422413 people talk about recovery but on one level were still responding
2422414 manufacturers of travel trailers and the government agencies that influence their design should consider using construction materials that emit lower levels of formaldehyde as well as designs that increase outside air ventilation
2422415 are not outfitted for adequate ventilation and are tighter than would be desired for housing with such small volume
2422416 found to be higher sometimes much higher than what is typically found in residential environments
2422417 the combination of these factors is likely to be the cause
2422418 you appear to have been complicit in giving fema precisely what they wanted however what fema wanted and what you approved giving them was not the whole truth regarding formaldehyde it was not based on best science nor did it provide trusted health information to the katrina survivors
2422419 i am concerned that this health consultation is incomplete and perhaps misleading
2422420 formaldehyde is classified as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen as such there is no recognized safe level of exposure thus any level of exposure to formaldehyde may pose a cancer risk regardless of duration failure to communicate this issue is possibly misleading and a threat to public health
2422421 femas initial contact came directly to me nine months ago on this issue
2422422 i reviewed the proposed statement and specified that they had neglected to address longer term risk including cancer
2422423 yet even after you were specifically told about the scientifically flawed and potentially misleading information in this report and apparently agreed that it should be amended your agency did not revise this health consultation until seven months later in october 2007 your lack of urgency in this matter is remarkable
2422424 despite that mission fema insisted that atsdr produce a report that would meet femas legal and policy goals not the public health issues of the residents some of them ill of those trailers incredibly atsdr obliged as a result atsdr stands discredited we have no confidence that the new testing protocols and sampling design agreed to by fema and atsdr for the current testing are any more trustworthy than the previous one
2422425 this agency has and continues to take responsible steps to address formaldehyde in its direct housing units fema has been proactive in reviewing the situation has recommended a wide range of actions to travel trailer residents that reduce health risks and has been working with experts to better understand the health environment and to investigate additional short and long term solutions the health and safety of residents has been and continues to be our primary concern
2422426 at this point all we can do is wonder whether fema is taking this seriously nobody should be living in housing that will make people sick there are still tens of thousand of people mostly along the gulf coast still being exposed its another example of politics trumping science
2422427 if people had known about the possible long term consequences perhaps more of them would have made an effort to find more appropriate housing for the families that have been stuck in these fema travel trailers for two and a half years
2422428 as people moved out there hasnt been a system set up to track people if you are worried about the long term possible consequences it would have been nice before people moved out to create a database to track the long term health of families that stayed there for an extended period of time its going to be much harder now to track people down

2422450 the ultimate fighter 6 will see coaches matt hughes and matt serra collide that night while it is all but announced that former ufc light heavyweight champion chuck liddell will get his long awaited match with former pride champion wanderlei silva
2422451 according to sources close to the silva he had planned to be in town by now along with the other ufc 77 fighters but there were delays in the issuance of his work visa apparently due to a recent holiday government offices in brazil were closed this past friday and monday thus delaying his visa being issued he evidently did receive the visa on wednesday and hopes to arrive in cincinnati on thursday most ufc fighters typically arrive four to five days prior to an event to fulfill the necessary media and production requirements as well as getting acclimated to their surroundings and finish any last minute weight cutting with silva arriving just two days prior to his fight as long as there are no further delays questions are sure to abound as to whether or not it will affect his performance come saturday night
2422452 the winner of the brandon vera tim sylvia fight on saturday at ufc 77 in cincinnati will meet antonio rodrigo nogueira for the vacant heavyweight title sometime early next year
2422453 as far as the decision to not be on the main card the ufc has told me that it has nothing to do with me it has to do with the fact that okami is a boring fighter they know ill try to put on an exciting fight in fact as i felt the hotel on thursday i ran into joe silva the matchmaker for the ufc and he asked to talk to me to express that again and apologized in advance to me

2422491 given the nature and dynamics of the presidential general election there are significant risks associated with conducting a concurrent countywide election on nov 4

2422493 the taxpayers will have to pay for these costs and that is something i will not allow to happen

2422516 dozer gets a piece of hot dog and the kids get candy
2422517 it makes it easier for them to take the ball from him and turn it in for candy
2422518 usually little kids go get them but we have a dog go get them
2422519 he loves to fetch things up he likes to be competitive
2422520 ive been bringing him to games since he was a pup hes the one who takes his leash and walks himself he can hear the difference between a well hit ball and a foul tip
2422521 one went over the fence the other day and i told him to go get it
2422522 so dozer stole one out of the batting cage and brought it to me
2422523 theyll tell me hey you run that ball down just like dozer hes real smart too he can even track the ball off the bat
2422524 hes saved us a lot by going to get them
2422525 its been 15 years since ive been to an outdoor concert
2422526 weve loved mofo for about four years since we saw them play the big woo in geneva minnesota
2422527 i cant believe we got to see mofo here in montana
2422528 if im gonna be away from home im glad its somewhere as pretty as this state and a place where the people are so friendly
2422529 the goal of the pace program is to intensively manage the participants so they can stay in their own homes
2422530 the beauty of it is it really maintains frail elderly individuals in their home and community as long as theyre able to hopefully forever
2422531 people in pace programs stay in their homes longer and they tend to have better health
2422532 all disciplines will see participants in one center physical therapy occupational therapy nursing social workers dieticians
2422533 its purely the license plate and the placard then the registered owner of the vehicle gets the citation no matter who is driving it
2422534 theyre not just people we handed a ticket book to
2422535 by the time we get there the vehicle is gone
2422536 this is a proactive quality of life issue we can address through the volunteers
2422537 so were kind of glad to see this because its a lot more to do
2422538 i try to do anything to get them excited about science
2422539 its about getting kids interested in something other than sitting in front of the tv
2422540 its not out of a book which helps bring it to life
2422541 they dont get to see this stuff on a normal day
2422542 ill keep doing it as long as theyll have me back
2422543 by the time we got there the four children were already out and three children were reported to be trapped in the back bedroom
2422544 an attempt was made to rescue both the other two children and the back bedroom flashed in fire which made it impossible until it was extinguished
2422545 its been my experience that trailer houses can be fully involved in fire in four to seven minutes
2422546 were talking about one of the most technologically advanced sophisticated energy projects on the planet
2422547 in my country we have a record of people who have visions and dreams and make them happen
2422548 not the six or seven or eight dollars an hour they are making now just to get by youre looking at 70 000 80 000 even 100 000 a year jobs
2422549 developers have been saying well do something about carbon but theyve been unwilling to put it into their permits its been a lot of empty promises
2422550 you have the optimum oil scenario playing out with prices skyrocketing but you have the bottom dropping out of wall street
2422551 its been tough sledding to try to get the money to build these plants
2422552 you hear about the problems in the capital markets but what people dont hear is there are dozens and dozens of projects hundreds of projects being funded
2422553 its not a typical business practice its just because what weve chosen to do during this period when we have some inventory we are trying to sell
2422554 its a mystery to me as to why thats on there
2422555 our tax base is diverse enough that there isnt enough delinquent money there to affect government a delinquency rate of 1 3 percent is pretty darn good in a tax situation
2422556 it has been higher lots higher we had a real downturn in the late 1970s and early 1980s
2422557 we can predict that theres going to be about a 1 5 percent delinquency in taxes
2422558 we expect to lose about 150 000 based on that my business manager told me its very predictable were able to merge all of our revenue sources so we can cover for a period of time any delinquent taxes that may be paid late
2422559 in the last couple of years more people are responsible for paying their own taxes
2422560 they refinance and choose not to escrow lots of times they forget that taxes are due twice a year
2422561 a lot of people get really spooked that an investment company may come in here and take a tax lien on their property
2422562 the delinquency clock in montana is 36 months if you cant pay its 36 months before yellowstone county issues tax deeds either to ourselves or whoever puts a tax lien on the property
2422563 certainly yellowstone county doesnt want property for failure to pay your tax bills we try hard to work with delinquent taxpayers if there are problems with appraisals or other problems weve been real progressive in that attempt
2422564 ive been working with mustangs hitting coach tony jaramillo a lot just working on staying back and letting the ball come to me
2422565 it paid off tonight i put some good swings on it
2422566 my curveball helped out a lot tonight and i was just basically trying to fill up the strike zone and put the ball in play
2422567 my defense definitely helped out well with that thats my whole game plan just throw strikes and fill it up
2422568 you definitely hit a rhythm and when you get in that rhythm you just block everything out and pitches start popping the mitt in the right spots
2422569 its one of those knock on wood type deals and hopefully we keep playing as good
2422570 if something does happen the guys are playing good enough that theyre going to get out of the rut pretty quick
2422571 were talking about a 70 year plan can you imagine
2422572 i wont realize the income from it myself it will be our grandchildren
2422573 its kind of scary i hope they invest it wisely
2422574 this project will stand up under its own financial feet its enormously expensive
2422575 this county big horn is one of the poorest counties in the nation according to the last census
2422576 coal to liquids sounds pretty good with gas prices so high
2422577 if the coal belongs to the crow tribe i believe the money should go directly to them
2422578 the crow nation has 2 million acres and theres no development theres one restaurant in 2 million acres and no grocery store well two little ones
2422579 weve got wind lumber clean coal so it is going to work
2422580 this project could have been built elsewhere but this project has been selected to be built in the crow nation
2422581 with the unemployment rate at 50 percent on the crow nation we have the crow workers ready willing and able
2422582 bloomington is getting an all star in eugene a guy who is a perennial double digit performer in sacks and tackles for loss and theyre getting a quality defensive back in courtney

2422621 lo que ha hecho lourdes flores es canalizar esta insatisfacci n de la poblaci n si esto les parece al apra una alianza con el humalismo tenemos que decirles que no estamos radicalizando la posici n sino simplemente manifestando una realidad que la puede comprobar cualquier peruano
2422622 m s all de calificar las expresiones el gobierno debe recoger la cr tica o los planteamientos que se les llegue a realizar y empezar a actuar sobre ello de nada sirve tener un modelo que permita un crecimiento en el pa s si ste aleja a un sector de peruanos que hoy se mantiene en la extrema pobreza

2422662 the true shepherd is one who knows even the path that passes through the valley of death one who walks with me even on the path of final solitude where no one can accompany me guiding me through he himself has walked this path he has descended into the kingdom of death he has conquered death and he has returned to accompany us now and to give us the certainty that together with him we can find a way through
2422663 if any man would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever would save his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it

2422675 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that sen mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president
2422676 the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2422677 all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2422678 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2422679 the viability of georgia as a state their viability as a responsible member of the world community
2422680 russia has to stop harassing its neighbors and attacking its neighbors and if not the next will be ukraine next the baltic states and then we will be back in the soviet union
2422681 you cant stop them but you can get out of their way
2422682 if there were the investment in voting infrastructure that there should be we would be totally unnecessary
2422683 we have already been seeing attacks in the wild for the past two weeks
2422684 playing russian roulette with a gun that has 100 bullet chambers instead of six
2422685 should be to take the gun out of peoples hands
2422686 they are relying on infrastructure that was not intended to do what people assume it does
2422687 what makes this so frustrating is that no one has been listening to what we have been saying for the past 17 years
2422688 dnssec is not an overnight solution for the kaminsky problem but its the right solution in the long run

2422690 we have concluded based on lab access records witness accounts and other information that dr hatfill did not have access to the particular anthrax used in the attacks and that he was not involved in the anthrax mailings
2422691 they have got to get some technically competent people to talk about the science

2422693 no subpoena was ever issued for your telephone toll records
2422694 no investigative use was made of the records and they have now been removed from the fbis databases
2422695 i thanked director mueller for calling and informing us of this and apologizing
2422696 i told him that we would be asking our general counsel to look into this
2422697 wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future
2422698 the u s must understand the strong relationship between drug production and terrorism and should therefore recognize the need for strict action against drug production in afghanistan the u s administration must redefine its priorities in afghanistan and realize that the elimination of drug economy is an issue of peace and stability and a sine qua non for its success in the war on terror
2422699 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2422700 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2422701 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2422702 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2422703 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2422704 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2422705 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2422706 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2422707 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2422708 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2422709 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2422710 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2422711 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2422712 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2422713 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2422714 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2422715 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2422716 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2422717 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2422718 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2422719 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2422720 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2422721 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2422722 there is a different way that you approach spending it that can take you on a smooth path
2422723 there is a way that you organize the spending and align it into certain key issues and sectors and what you will get is maximum pay off
2422724 it is spending at all levels of government that causes inflation
2422725 so it is important in ensuring that there is coordination of the whole fiscal decentralization and fiscal responsibility this is about the issue of the effectiveness and efficiency of the spending when you look at the procurement system are you getting value for money across board all of this aggregate together to ensure that spending does not wreck your relative macro economic stability
2422726 as a license to go into unbridled expenditure but actually leverage it well in away that it doesnt take youout of balance there is a way that you spend the excess crude that can immediately take the country out of balance
2422727 one of the things that nigeria did in the last years of its democracy was to put in place that important building block macro economic stability you dont want to lose it so ensuring that you continue to manage public finance in a way that enables economic stability when you look at the boom in the oil revenue it must not become a temptation for doing things that would unbundle the macroeconomic stability what drives theprivate sector out of the door the most is an environment that is unstable and volatile

2422735 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2422736 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2422737 the researchers note that the simulation does not model any forms of normal matter such as stars or planets
2422738 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2422739 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2422740 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2422741 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2422742 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2422743 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2422754 ive been ready for a new olympic experience for four years now
2422755 what were trying to now is to bring back the honor and respect to usa basketball and to change the perception of how some may view us
2422756 were on a mission if they people view us in a negative way we want to make it a positive way
2422757 you know a lot of the reaction to that team in 2004 was unfair
2422758 that 04 was a team that was put together because other people didnt want to go you had to ask certain younger guys like myself lebron carmelo carlos boozer onto the team
2422759 it was just a team that we thought we were going to go over there to greece and win this team knows we have a very tough task but we also understand that we have the ability and talent to win
2422760 we laughed and joked about it but on the inside it was kind of hurtful for us to get booed we are supposed to be the best basketball players in the world for us to go somewhere and get booed it didnt feel right on the inside
2422761 i think now with this team we have a chance to put that mark back where its supposed to be for usa basketball thats what has made this special to come over here to china and get one of the warmest welcomes that anyone could get it wasnt like this in greece
2422762 we were put together in about 2 weeks and we werent prepared for what we were getting into no excuses we lost to better teams at the time but now some of our guys have been together for three years we know coach ks system we dont have to think about what were running its instinctive
2422763 we had a lot of intangible stuff that led to us not winning in 04
2422764 the biggest thing is we just werent ready we were under prepared
2422765 but the dream team didnt play the competiton that were going to be playing this game of basketball has caught up there are going to be games where were going to win by 10 win by 12 win by 1 maybe win by 38 who knows at the end of the day all theyre going to remember is if you win
2422766 if we win the gold medal and they say the usa won but they only won by one i dont care well take it

2422771 we must have more cooperation with each other and its our job because we are fighting the war for ourselves
2422772 we found the council tower and paid a small entrance fee to climb to the top from here there is an excellent view over the city in all directions and also down to the three intersecting squares around the tower these are a delight and reminded us of many italian squares that we have visited caf s and restaurants lined the edges outside beautiful old buildings
2422773 we tried to find typical romanian cuisine for lunch but failed because the city is dominated by italian cuisine in the end we both had pizza although my marinara was quite different from others that i have had in italy and elsewhere it had a large amount of garlic scattered in amongst the tuna and capers but i must say that it was delicious i must try to reproduce it when we get home
2422774 sibiu is a very cosmopolitan city with large german and hungarian speaking communities
2422775 after lunch we investigated the lower town and it was clear that although much of the centre has restored and work is continuing one only needs to move a few hundred metres away to find the more authentic city this still has many historic buildings but they are in a poor state of repair and are inhabited by much poorer people i suspect that given a few years this area will also be prettified

2422781 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too

2422891 celexa is generic now and costs 4 00 a month and it works well for me
2422892 celexa is the old version and some people use it as an appetite suppressant and when their patent ran out they reformatted the drug and called is lexapro so your doctor might try to sell you on that but its not really any better according to the internet and its much more expensive so you might want to consider trying the cheaper one before you take lexapro

2422930 weve got a lot of work to do in this campaign and im the underdog my friends
2422931 there was a time before this time a year ago where most political pundits didnt think the former governor from a small southern state nor this guy from arizona whose campaign had imploded had much of a chance
2422932 i want you to know with the utmost sincerity he really was my second choice to be president of the united states

2422948 for him to come out and throw the ball the way he did for him to want the ball in the seventh inning with the pitch count where it was he made some great pitches and keep putting zeros up there
2422949 its unacceptable on my part giving up two home runs
2422950 the counts were 0 2 1 2 those are things that just cant happen i put my team in a real tough position right there right from the get go
2422951 i felt good going back out there for the second inning
2422952 i was able to get into a rhythm in the first inning i just tried to get ahead of hitters and be aggressive

2422964 many people thought the olympic games should be a good opportunity for the rule of law and political system but the government just want to use olympics games as a chance to show how powerful they are
2422965 but i think if more and more people know the truth about china that would be helpful if you go to beijing you can see beautiful buildings and flowers and smiling faces but thats not the real china maybe only one part

2422975 son you have worked earnestly and served me well this tells me that the experiences will be good for you on the sea i will speak of this knowledge though i do not share it easily as these lessons are meaningless for those who want the riches without the work
2422976 there are three lessons you must heed the first is that a full wind singing in your sails is useless even a dangerous siren if you do not have a rudder that is well kept and attended by one who steers it true the currents and winds on the seas are strong treachery is their nature and they feast on those who desire speed without control this first lesson tells us that correct steering is more important than speed have a strong rudder and use it with great care
2422977 these are the three secrets that have served me well follow the heavens steer correctly then look for strong winds to increase your speed when good conditions are not present rely on your anchor do not be afraid to wait
2422978 now go my son and may the winds be with you
2422979 i have waited long for your return as i seek employment on your vessel again our ship left port with a sturdy rudder good sextant and anchor but less than a week from this port we were caught in an unexpected fierce storm we floundered in hurricane winds and raging seas all was lost i still wish to become my own master but must start at the beginning again can you give me work and more training to help me avoid such storms

2422986 today blood is shed and people are killed in south ossetia and my heart deeply laments over it orthodox christians are among those who have raised their hands against each other orthodox peoples called by the lord to live in fraternity and love confront each other
2422987 stop dont let more blood shed dont let todays conflict boil over show wisdom and courage come to negotiating table to respect traditions outlook and hopes of georgian and ossetian people
2422988 buy up buildings and build camps where the psychological brainwashing of children took place
2422989 cooperate is too strong a way of putting it during the years that the fsb has existed it has not held the reins of power inside the russian orthodox church but nowadays only that organization the fsb can stop the funds that come into russia from abroad that are aimed at dismantling society religious sects are directed specifically towards doing that both the church and the fsb in this respect have the same goal to keep our society whole we dont want to make sectarians into martyrs but the religious lives of sects ought to stay within the bounds of their churches
2422990 therefore the appearance of an american prophet inside the closed city had the effect equivalent to a bomb exploding
2422991 especially because the infiltrator didnt bother to hide himself but instead gathered city residents for his preaching
2422992 seeing a foreigner in our city especially one who is agitating for some kind of religion wasnt possible in the past
2422993 there are off limit sites here which our fellow citizens are not allowed to visit and here a foreigner is all of a sudden in your face
2422994 the moment he put the small crowd into a trance and they started speaking gibberish
2422995 did not find any dangerous items or things that would belong to a spy
2422996 the murmansk and monchegorskaya diocese has regularly warned regional and city officials about the illegal activities of this totalitarian and anti government sect
2422997 this sect has followers in almost every major population center of the murmansk region the number of its adepts exceeds several thousand people
2422998 the city administration along with orthodox residents are concerned that thousands of followers of alternative churches have converged on novoshakhtinsk from all over southern russia
2422999 but only half of the amount has so far reached the state coffers as most of the violators are too poor to afford the fines
2423000 about 80 000 rubles in fines for employing an illegal manual laborer is quite a big burden for most employers but the penalty is worth it as it makes an employer think twice before taking the risk
2423001 judging from random raids our inspectors carry out the violations revealed are only a tip of the iceberg
2423002 we are fighting a war which is almost impossible to win when employers are running for cheap laborers in pursuit of quick and big profits forgetting the fact that illegal immigrants live in this city at the expense of tax payers
2423003 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
2423004 in terms of the effect he has had on history solzhenitsyn is the dominant writer of the 20th century who else compares orwell koestler and yet when his name comes up now it is more often than not as a freak a monarchist an antisemite a crank a has been
2423005 shocked readers by describing the savagery of the soviet state under the dictator yosif stalin it helped erase lingering sympathy for the soviet union among many leftist intellectuals especially in europe
2423006 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
2423007 the split in todays world is perceptible even to a hasty glance any of our contemporaries readily identifies two world powers each of them already capable of entirely destroying the other however understanding of the split often is limited to this political conception to the illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces the truth is that the split is a much profounder and a more alienating one that the rifts are more than one can see at first glance this deep manifold split bears the danger of manifold disaster for all of us in accordance with the ancient truth that a kingdom in this case our earth divided against itself cannot stand
2423008 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
2423009 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
2423010 theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil
2423011 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
2423012 in the midst of exhausting prison camp relocations marching in a column of prisoners in the gloom of bitterly cold evenings with strings of camp lights glimmering through the darkness we would often feel rising in our breast what we would have wanted to shout out to the whole world if only the whole world could have heard us
2423013 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie
2423014 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2423015 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2423016 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2423017 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2423018 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2423019 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2423020 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2423021 i hadnt really made up my mind about the whole framing issue up until now i have been somewhat skeptical of the idea as related by some of its practitioners mainly because i felt that they did not properly understand the religious landscape they were trying to operate in the despicable hit piece on pz over at framing science pretty much decides it for me i think the piece is a perfect example of the anti rationalism and obfuscation that has largely propelled the republican war on science the post owes much to the willie horton ads in the juxtaposition of a scruffy looking pz with the nattily dressed dj grothe a vile despicable trick if you ask me but this is a perfect example of the strategy that framing embraces truth is irrelevant as long as you can swindle folks into accepting what ever nonsense you fling their way
2423022 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2423023 we have a lot of high profile cases we are presently working on and his georges own is likely to be one of them
2423024 you see people should stop being mischievous bode george is back i have rested enough my systems are working very well all the checks i did not do for many years that nearly resulted to ill health ive done them now and i feel well too in fact i feel like an 18 year old ready to launch back on the plough there is no problem at all i am happy to be back
2423025 i will go if efcc calls me am i not a nigerian what is there to answer on me is it not in the last six years that they are asking how can a part time chairman of the nigerian ports authority be responsible for anything there whoever is making the wuru wuru there they know i am sure the minds there now would clear it
2423026 rather than follow the normal channel of assigning responsibilities in the authority the board management politicians and even the contractors resorted to using all kinds of ways to process contract proposals thereby short circuiting existing regulations and procedures
2423027 an in depth investigation on all contracts awarded by the npa from 2001 to 2003 and examine all outstanding bills from its creditors ascertain whether or not such contracts were awarded in accordance with extant government rules and regulations governing the award of contracts and identify the culprits and apportion blame as applicable
2423028 the board and management of npa during the period under review are responsible for the flagrant violation of the extant government rules and regulations on award of contracts
2423029 financial recklessness disregard for due process guidelines gross and massive inflation of contract prices and excessive contract splitting
2423030 the npa is regarded as one of the parastatals where irregularities and malpractices have become deeply entrenched
2423031 the inability of the efcc to arrest george in the past few years is one of the things that i crucified nuhu ribadu for and for which i supported his demotion by the police service commission
2423032 with bode georges arrest waziri has opened a new vista for prosecution of suspected corrupt leaders and will convince the whole world that she is worth her salt
2423033 efcc should go ahead and prosecute him but until he is proven guilty we cannot assume that he is guilty

2423040 soy una persona y es normal que tenga sentimientos variados aunque a veces no me gusten y por ello tratar de cambiar aquello que me hace sentir mal
2423041 the cost of living in la is high its hard
2423042 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
2423043 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2423044 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
2423045 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
2423046 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
2423047 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
2423048 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
2423049 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
2423050 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
2423051 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
2423052 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
2423053 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
2423054 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
2423055 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
2423056 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
2423057 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
2423058 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
2423059 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2423060 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
2423061 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
2423062 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
2423063 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
2423064 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
2423065 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
2423066 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
2423067 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
2423068 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
2423069 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
2423070 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
2423071 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
2423072 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
2423073 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
2423074 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2423075 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
2423076 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
2423077 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
2423078 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
2423079 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
2423080 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it

2423082 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
2423083 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2423084 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
2423085 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
2423086 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

2423090 this was against the islamic values as well as those of the establishment and the revolution and what the government claims to be accomplishing
2423091 putting a woman on the front is telling the world that we are not for the promotion of the islamic values
2423092 as i have also mentioned before the attendance of the iranian women in the international events and exhibiting them outside iran is against islamic values however not only we are sending them to the events they are put on the front as well

2423096 we are not a side who will sit back and bask in our achievements there is a hunger for more
2423097 it comes from the top the manager the senior players they never settle for one trophy they are all looking for the next one

2423117 my initial reaction was right when pedroia threw it to me was to go get him and try and tag him before cabrera scored
2423118 he was further away than i thought i didnt even think to look home because i thought i was going to get him on the tag its just a play that i made a bad read on and i cost us a run
2423119 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like

2423122 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2423123 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2423124 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2423125 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2423126 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2423127 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2423128 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2423129 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2423136 he had a few pieces of the wreckage that he later donated to museums
2423137 is in better shape than we thought it would be
2423138 it will be a year before we make a conclusion about what happened
2423139 then the rotor struck another tree and the aircraft crashed on its side
2423140 this is like storytelling passed down from person to person
2423141 lost all my money but a two dollar bill and im on a long journey home
2423142 but based on this data do we have issues yes
2423143 is hurtful to the larger community because people are not going to call the police when something goes wrong
2423144 because there was a small light near my license plate that was out then they get deep into interrogation theyre trying to figure out if youre here legally
2423145 we need to find out why theyre doing it and if we find out its more the new officers than those with five to 20 years experience that tells me theres a lack of training when it comes to policing black people and latinos
2423146 most of the stuff we do is very legitimate and some of the stuff we do innocent people get caught up in
2423147 i have vice presidents and executive board members of the naacp that have been stopped on their way home
2423148 refreshing that theyre releasing statistics that show what blacks and latinos have been saying for a long time its a first step in doing something about it
2423149 driving while black would pass over the years but growing up in sacramento it got worse it got to the point where i knew which outfit i was more likely to be pulled over in
2423150 i was wearing a hooded sweat shirt plus i was in a mercedes plus being black
2423151 to stay calm cool always be respectful and play nice make sure they know im not what they think i was when they pulled me over
2423152 theres been an enormous population growth in placer county the number of older people who have moved into the area has increased enormously with all these senior communities
2423153 its really bad the european union has proposed a ban on it
2423154 im worried about all the children at the school i rode my bike up there and you can look over the retaining wall the school is right there
2423155 im just concerned that this is going to be next to me
2423156 we dont really seem to have anything in place that will protect the kids and the neighborhood
2423157 there are other funeral homes in placer county and we have not required permits nor have we had complaints or concerns from neighbors
2423158 the gorkhaland demand is purely a matter between the west bengal government and the central government we have nothing to say on this and we should not be unnecessarily harassed in the event
2423159 the state suffers a loss of rs 3 crore 7 lakhs every day whenever the nh31a is forced closed
2423160 the state government has also plans to set up a lepcha museum near the structure of the stairway he added
2423161 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
2423162 i dont think hes going to be making a living in politics any time soon
2423163 the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown
2423164 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2423165 she is the finest human being i have ever known
2423166 i was trying to keep this mistake i had made from becoming public
2423167 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2423168 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2423169 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing nothing could be further from the truth

2423173 the longing for a man to make each of us feel necessary surrounds young women is sedimented stubbornly in our most fundamental emotional fibers the contradictions of romance and feminism form the very curl and thread of our cultural dna
2423174 the college educated class may be hip to the exploitation of womens bodies as sex objects cheap labor incubators and most of us girls know something about

2423176 pas un bonheur davoir des amis qui viennent de loin
2423177 this co ordinated approach with our well trained units is completely intelligence driven these officers especially those with the niu have been trained to act with brute force
2423178 we want to stop atm bombings before they happen and thats exactly what weve started to do
2423179 we need highly trained and heavily equipped police units that can deal with heavily armed bombers its the only way to solve the atm bombing problem two police officials in a patrol van cant be expected to deal with a group of 10 criminals
2423180 criminals virtually set up an ambush situation and almost expect police to arrive it was unrealistic to think they could deal with such violent and calculated crimes
2423181 we have real concerns around the country we have increased student numbers but we are finding it difficult to fill lectureships because we cannot compete with salaries in the private sector which are 50 percent higher
2423182 we are battling with a lack of resources there are not enough studios and lecturers a lot of the students need extra attention there is a great demand for more graduates but how do we meet this need with resources we dont have its difficult to fill posts because many of the graduates go into the private sector
2423183 but it will not necessarily stay this way because of diminishing resources there has also been a deterioration in the calibre of high school students coming through we have to get our act together right across the board
2423184 this is a wake up call there were 2 000 vacancies in municipalities in the country that is why we have sewerage and water problems its of real concern
2423185 my friends first approached me about the list it was so humiliating
2423186 it says that my close friends and i who are also on the list are loose once we get drunk we look around for guys with lots of money to sleep around with
2423187 firstly i dont drink and secondly i am just not that way inclined and neither are my friends we dont go out looking for males to fall prey on we have our dignity
2423188 we think we know who it could be and if we are right it is just plain jealousy i think the culprits should be taught a lesson and an example should be made of them
2423189 i cant believe people would assume such things about me they list my nickname but a couple of my friends are on the list as well
2423190 its mean and hurtful i do hope they get caught
2423191 the defamatory lists were maliciously created saved and forwarded to the personal contacts of the user s who created them these users in turn forwarded this attachment to their personal contacts and so on

2423197 the expectation has increased year on year now we are fa trophy holders
2423198 i am expecting that the experience of last year has installed a belief into the players of what they can achieve we hope to feature in the play off places i genuinely think we have a great chance of being in the mix for promotion which would be a fantastic achievement but we will need to have our fair share of luck
2423199 it sounds like they have had a rough time in the past few years but i think they have signed three or four players and billy mcewans side will be strong we will be working on tactics and making sure that we will be ready for them
2423200 i inherited ashley when i first started managing the mens field hockey side about three years ago and it didnt take much for us all to see that he was an exceptional talent
2423201 he was named the most valuable player at the hamburg masters in september 2007 so a lot of people know he is a special talent hes mercurial
2423202 i would rather people see him as ashley jackson rather than compare him to stars from other sports it would be great for him to help raise the profile of hockey in this country
2423203 hes had three years of listening to me so there was not much advice i could give to him before he left for beijing other than to enjoy himself and make sure he comes home with a medal
2423204 ashley was an ice hockey star at a younger age and also played cricket at a county standard so hes obviously a very talented sportsman
2423205 i think he and fellow east grinstead and olympic hopeful glenn kirkham are both very excited and looking forward to the challenge
2423206 i dont think either will be nervous they both like playing under pressure and thats what ashley is all about
2423207 there wasnt much advice i could give mel because shes far more experienced than me shes been there before and she knows what its all about
2423208 theres probably nobody more dedicated than she and winning an olympic medal would mean everything to her thats why she plays hockey and thats why shes out there
2423209 canterbury is a big club so im sure there will be lots of groups of people getting together to watch the games
2423210 it will be great to see players like mel and jen in action and well all be rooting for them
2423211 i think thats a question best left to the discretion of the mechanics in the shop dont you after all theyre the ones hard at work fixing your car
2423212 is that setting an arbitrary deadline from the counter of this auto body shop is the surest guarantee that your car will break down as soon as you drive it out of the shop that wont just be a disaster for you it will disrespect all the hard work the mechanics have been doing on your car
2423213 we think its important to support our mechanics to the fullest

2423251 these people who contributed to who i am they are with me wherever i go and as history gets rewritten in small ways with each passing day my love for them only grows because the truth is it was the best of times mistakes were made hearts were broken harsh lessons learned but all that has receded into fond memory now how does it happen why are we so quick to forget the bad and romanticize the good maybe its because we need to believe that the time we spent together actually meant something that we were there for each other in a time in our lives that defined us all a time in our lives that we will never forget

2423294 we cant wait to get started on our welcome to london in four years time
2423295 it will be good for me to be able to get out there and really watch the game and study it
2423296 but again its too early we are just getting our first looks at it
2423297 i was running around the outside and went to turn up and just couldnt do what i normally do
2423298 we all trust those guys they will do whats best for me to get back as fast as possible without risking injury again
2423299 as we have done in the past we will probably err on the side of caution
2423300 im not that concerned about the results of the mri
2423301 i saw the injury when it happened obviously everybody responds differently so his bodys response will be a little bit different from anothers but one thing i think and believe is hes a pretty quick healer
2423302 ronnie did a great job thursday coming in and running the offense so i dont think well miss anything
2423303 those guys respect him and hes got control of the huddle and hell do a good job hell keep the offense on track and im able to take mental reps when im out there seeing the same things he is im just not able to make the throws so if anything it will be good for me to be able to get out there and really watch the game and study it
2423304 i get reps with the starting unit anyway so it wont be any different
2423305 thats important to get that kind of timing and get those guys in their right place
2423306 but more than anything else if those guys know what to do well be ok if they know how to do their job when he gets back well be fine
2423307 it puts us up with the elite bcs schools and we are very happy to be there because i think thats our rightful place
2423308 its not the top of the top in the elite but obviously three times better than the previous deal is significant

2423333 yesterday at about 12 51 mr nasheed entered the office
2423334 i believe that the national executive committee have already decide that the mdp should not meet with president gayoom therefore i believe that mr nasheed wont meet president gayoom as chairperson of mdp
2423335 i believe that this act by the chairperson of mdp was very selfish and this is an pattern of dictatorship when he does something like that he should inform the partys national executive committee he should at least have informed the president he should have done this after consulting other ranking officials of the party
2423336 mdp is the heart of chairperson mr nasheed i have no more to say

2423340 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain

2423342 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2423343 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2423346 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that

2423375 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2423376 the biggest shiite threat to both the iraqi government and the u s led coalition
2423377 children especially pre adolescent children use land lines whenever possible keeping the use of cellphones for essential purposes only limiting the length of cellphone calls and using headsets or hands free options whenever possible
2423378 while scientists were pretty dismissive of any risk years ago with the accumulation of studies it appears people who have been using their phones for a long period of time are at greater risk of certain kinds of brain tumours there is a pattern emerging
2423379 generally calls should be limited to five or 10 minutes
2423380 perhaps the most alarming issue we are seeing with black henna tattoos is the increase in the number of children even children as young as four who are getting them and experiencing skin reactions
2423381 kids make up a significant portion of the population that receives temporary tattoos because parents mistakenly think they are safe since they are not permanent and are available at so many popular venues catering to families in fact nothing could be further from the truth
2423382 each exposure to ppd re challenges the immune system so each time you get a black henna tattoo or use a hair dye that contains ppd there is an increased risk of having a reaction
2423383 many people are sensitized to ppd but dont have a reaction to it however each time you are exposed to black henna you increase your risk of developing a lifelong allergy to it
2423384 unless the artist can tell you exactly whats in the tattoo dont get one
2423385 the balance of your pockets i mean the balance of your rewards
2423386 we do not deny that the situation in iraq is difficult but he directed the green card writer to the web sites describing how to apply

2423393 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2423394 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2423395 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2423396 tremendously talented musician with a subtle sense of poetry and musicianship he wasnt loud he wasnt flashy but very sensitive
2423397 behind the scenes innovator on the folk scene for decades
2423398 walk right in sit right down daddy let your mind roll on

2423400 pete never swung the way erik could swing his banjo could take command and carry everybody along with it

2423402 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman that we could all identify with
2423403 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2423404 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman that we could all identify with
2423405 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2423406 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2423407 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2423408 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2423409 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2423410 elogio a rapidez e prontid o da pol cia a chegar ao local dominando o cen rio do crime e evitando a morte dos ref ns

2423419 santa ana now has a lot more buildings parking lots and streets which absorb and hold heat some of it through the night
2423420 the increase in temperatures in santa ana as well as an increase in extreme heat days and in heat waves is primarily about 60 percent due to the urban heat island effect
2423421 santa ana is embedded in the dramatic urbanization or extreme makeover of orange county more homes lawns shopping centers traffic freeways and agriculture all absorbing and retaining solar radiation making santa ana and orange county warmer
2423422 on a larger scale orange county is atmospherically connected to our ever expanding and warming southern california megalopolis
2423423 it might be in your interest to enslave us but how is it in our interest to be your slaves
2423424 well ummm perhaps it might be better to be independent but we arent so sure but we think we might be able to do better so there is a possibility a chance not 100 sure but still
2423425 the debate for scottish independence has degenerated into a car boot sale bargain session and it is mainly based on economic grounds like how much money for the north sea oil or the european subsidy or the tax raising powers or the level of investment in public sector or stuff like that that is so disappointing and boring it is like negotiating a contract for sewerage services or recycling service level agreements
2423426 mr rove helped secure two white house terms for george w bush by the lights of his profession he was a success america is in no mood to thank him for it
2423427 batan badan tenaga nuklir nasional sudah menyampaikan rencana pembangunan pltn itu ke pemprov banten dan kami menyambut baik rencana itu

2423434 its tough to call one week a trend but we feel a little more comfortable in saying there is a developing trend coming we believe that weve seen the top of oil prices
2423435 what this really means is it has a big impact on peoples sentiment on how its going to affect the consumer
2423436 that sentiment that if gas prices come down maybe the consumer wont die as we thought
2423437 the fundamentals are coming into play for oil and they are terrible

2423454 in fact the georgian president breached the sovereignty of russia and committed a war crime that could not be forgiven he had crossed the line which normal politicians were not allowed to cross
2423455 obviously saakashvili hoped that the world would be focused on the opening of the olympic games and the georgian aggression would draw less attention

2423472 ten years ago the government used a similar charge of sodomy against anwar ibrahim and kept him in jail for six years the conviction was ultimately overturned
2423473 in 1998 amnesty international considered anwar ibrahim a prisoner of conscience today there are again indications that the government is not playing by the rules in this case
2423474 we are also concerned about the safety of all the witnesses in this case particularly dr mohamed osman and we call on the government to provide adequate protection to them

2423499 thariqah jalan hidup nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dimana beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para shahabat berada di atasnya yang selamat dari syubhat dan syahwat
2423500 ahlus sunnah itu orang yang mengetahui apa yang masuk ke dalam perutnya dari makanan yang halal
2423501 tidak diragukan bahwa ahli naqli dan atsar pengikut atsar rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan atsar para shahabatnya mereka itu ahlus sunnah
2423502 mereka pada mulanya tidak pernah menanyakan tentang sanad ketika terjadi fitnah para ulama mengatakan tunjukkan nama nama perawimu kepada kami kemudian ia melihat kepada ahlus sunnah sehingga hadits mereka diambil dan melihat kepada ahlul bidah dan hadits mereka tidak diambil
2423503 siapakah ahlus sunnah itu ia menjawab ahlus sunnah itu mereka yang tidak mempunyai laqab julukan yang sudah terkenal yakni bukan jahmi qadari dan bukan pula rafidli
2423504 mereka para ulama menamakan ahlul jamaah karena jamaah itu adalah ijtima berkumpul dan lawannya firqah
2423505 pada hari yang di waktu itu ada muka yang putih berseri dan adapula muka yang muram
2423506 adapun orang orang yang mukanya putih berseri adalah ahlus sunnah wal jamaah sedangkan orang orang yang mukanya hitam muram adalah ahlul ahwa wa dhalalah
2423507 jika sampai khabar kepadamu tentang seseorang di arah timur ada pendukung sunnah dan yang lainnya di arah barat maka kirimkanlah salam kepadanya dan doakanlah mereka alangkah sedikitnya ahlus sunnah wal jamaah
2423508 jika dikatakan ahlus sunnah maka yang dimaksud dengan mereka itu adalah asyariyah dan maturidiyah
2423509 ketahuilah bahwa pokok semua aqaid ahlus sunnah wal jamaah atas dasar ucapan dua kutub yakni abul hasan dan imam abu manshur al maturidi
2423510 adapun al firqotun najiyah yang terpilih adalah orang orang yang rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam berkata tentang mereka
2423511 ahlus sunnah adalah abu hasan dan abu mansyur al maturidi dan orang orang yang mengikuti jalan mereka berdua mereka berjalan di atas petunjuk salafus shalih dalam memahami aqaid
2423512 maha suci allah yang telah memperjalankan hamba nya pada suatu malam dari masjidil haram ke masjidil aqsha yang telah kami berkahi sekelilingnya agar kami perlihatkan kepadanya sebagian dari tanda tanda kebesaran kami sesungguhnya dia adalah maha mendengar lagi maha melihat

2423515 ibu lebih penyayang dari bapak dan doa orang yang penyayang tidak akan sia sia
2423516 barang siapa yang diuji dengan sesuatu dari anak anak perempuannya lalu dia berbuat baik kepada mereka maka mereka akan menjadi penghalang baginya dari api neraka
2423517 aku bertanya kepada rasulullah saw siapakah yang lebih besar haknya terhadap wanita
2423518 sebaiknya kalian semua tidak usah ikur berziarah dan tidak ada pahala bagi kamu tetapi tinggallah di rumah dan berkhidmatlah kepada suami niscaya pahalanya sama dengan ibadat ibadat orang laki laki
2423519 wahai fatimah untuk setiap wanita yang mengeluarkan peluh ketika membuat roti allah akan mejadikan 7 parit diantara dirinya dengan api neraka jarak diantara parit itu ialah sejauh langit dan bumi
2423520 wahai fatimah bagi setiap wanita yang memintal benang allah akan mencatatkan untuknya perbuatan baik sebanyak utus benang yang dibuat dan memadamkan seratus perbuatan jahat
2423521 wahai fatimah untuk setiap wanita yang menenun kain allah telah menentukan satu tempat khusus untuknya di atas tahta di hari akhirat
2423522 wahai fatimah bagi setiap wanita yang memintal benang dan kemudian dibuat pakaian untuk anak anaknya maka allah akan memberikan pahala sama seperti orang yang memberi makan kepada 1000 orang lapar dan memberi pakaian kepada 1000 orang yang tidak berpakaian
2423523 wahai fatimah bagi setiap wanita yang meminyakkan rambut anaknya menyikatnya mencuci pakaian mereka dan memandikan anaknya allah akan memberikan pahala kebaikan sebanyak helai rambut mereka dan menghapus sebanyak itu pula dosa dosanya dan menjadikan dirinya kelihatan berseri di mata orang orang yang memerhatikannya
2423524 ya fatimah barang mana wanita meminyakkan rambut dan janggut suaminya memotong kumis misai dan mengerat kukunya allah akan memberinya minum dari sungai sungai serta diringankan allah baginya sakaratul maut dan akan didapatinya kuburnya menjadi sebuah taman dari taman taman syurga dan dicatatkan allah baginya kelepasan dari api neraka dan selamatlah ia melintas titian shirat
2423525 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore
2423526 vacation all i ever wanted vacation had to get away
2423527 durch die macht der wahrheit habe ich als lebender das universum erobert
2423528 unser land ist reich warum klappt das n tigste nicht
2423529 why where is it give it to me i beg you i am on my knees and my mouth is open
2423530 they were concerned enough to list it as a fire and life safety issue and they were given the money to address it
2423531 you do have a fire alarm in there but its not up to state code
2423532 if theres something that critically needed to be done right now it would be done
2423533 if a buildings unsafe were not going to put people in it we dont want to see anyone get hurt
2423534 first magnus did not believe the relationships with the builders and real estate companies referenced in the report to be a violation of respa
2423535 unaware of the substance of the allegations in the inspector generals audit report we have only recently obtained a copy of the report and are reviewing it
2423536 its inappropriate and its wrong but unfortunately there are a lot of people who think that way
2423537 the customer needs to have an opportunity to select from a variety of sources not just one
2423538 if we built any portion of it in mexico then obviously we are going to remove it
2423539 because it was underground it was a little trickier than perhaps we had first anticipated
2423540 we support the efforts of the ibwc boundary commission to resolve this the ibwc is particularly well placed for helping to resolve this issue in a constructive manner
2423541 im very proud of my players we play a good match with a good rhythm
2423542 we learned a lot from the world grand prix we play we win and we lose and we are getting used to the ups and downs and all the changes
2423543 we have made full preparation for the match psychologically and physically
2423544 we are sorry aguero cant be here but her absence actually drive us to be more united and work even harder
2423545 the players lost their attention at the court and we have problems in defense and the reception is not good either especially at the third set
2423546 we have kept telling my players to be prepared for tough matches but it seems that i fought here alone its a issue of attitude
2423547 missing the major international competitions turned out to be a loss for us and we lost the chance to play with strong teams and to be more prepared
2423548 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
2423549 in florida in 2000 and ohio in 2004 we witnessed the obstruction and manipulation of votes by election officials and possible tampering with computer voting machines but equally insidious is the malapportionment of electoral college votes which disenfranchises whole sections of the voting public
2423550 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
2423551 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
2423552 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
2423553 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2423554 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2423555 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2423556 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2423557 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2423558 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2423559 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2423560 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2423561 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2423562 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2423563 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2423564 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2423565 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2423566 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2423567 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2423568 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2423569 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2423570 el se or zapatero se est quedando sin dinero para financiar nada
2423571 si atacaran todos los d as la casa de pedraz a ver c mo lo interpretaba
2423572 have we not all one father has not one god created us
2423573 you saw everyday people living and fearing and dreaming the same things you do
2423574 when you see the world through the eyes of another your own world will never be the same
2423575 were not pushy but when people ask about us we say there are good people at church
2423576 but i found out about them being protected birds and i felt a little guilty
2423577 i studied about it and when you do you get this mental picture of them and how they fly all the way to venezuela in the winter and you think oh my gosh these poor little birds but i thought theyd find other chimneys
2423578 im really learning to appreciate wild animals that take care of themselves if you just give them a little help
2423579 i just want to know if we can do something
2423580 thats our latest model it sells for about 6 000
2423581 give shirley 10 and she will do your whole familys christmas shopping
2423582 i think this research does to some extent call some of those assumptions into question
2423583 it certainly shows that stepfathers or even unmarried social fathers can be quite productive in rearing children
2423584 have to work harder to fit in and to have a useful productive role
2423585 if there were no proper control here blood leaving the mothers blood vessel would trigger release of serotonin platelets would aggregate vessels constrict and the fetus wouldnt get what it needs
2423586 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
2423587 were professional players i mean if you find somebody that says aw were comfortable and these games right now dont matter i will slap them right now every day as a professional player you try to win every day and thats what were doing
2423588 that team is so good i mean they can grind you to death
2423589 were very comfortable with who we are and what were doing but i think it was 1978 that boston coughed up a 14 game lead to the yankees and lost in a one game playoff to a bucky dent home run in 95 the angels spit up an 11 game lead in mid august and last year you saw what happened to the mets down the stretch so nothings a lock
2423590 no lead is safe with those guys they could go off at any time
2423591 i left a couple of pitches out over the plate that i wish i could take back
2423592 i wasnt sure if melky hit me or the wall its a good thing i didnt have to throw the ball right after that
2423593 when they look into the future and raise 200 million dollars and build a new academic facility thats a plus for them
2423594 imagine 2 people in 2 airports getting on a plane and
2423595 the flyer was going against the sun and taking fortune away from singapore
2423596 we are quite confident that air quality will have no negative impact on the athletes
2423597 it wasnt the denver nuggets it was a usa team
2423598 we feel we have a team that has the capability and the talent to compete for a gold medal the team was picked to play the international game not the nba game
2423599 the versatility of our team and the quickness is what we have tried to focus on
2423600 calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation of tibet
2423601 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2423602 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2423603 the chinese government will not be allowed to use the olympics to hide the reality of its harsh rule inside tibet
2423604 the biggest factor affecting the success of recycling is the lack of convenience if there was a recycle bin next to every general rubbish bin in the world it would be blatantly irrational and utter stupidity to not use it until we improve the convenience there will be complacency
2423605 he said its nothing too serious he reckons the attacker was drunk
2423606 the hotel is highly embarrassed a complaint has been lodged and they are doing a sweep of the area
2423607 my mother died and that was 20 years ago thats what matters to you
2423608 she was alive one day and dead the next thats the worst thing thats ever happened to me this is not really up there with that
2423609 you are in this game to win when the players and fans suffer disappointment you suffer along with them
2423610 i still feel it as much as it did when it happened 15 or 20 years ago that never goes away from you if you are competitive then thats what happens to you
2423611 managers always take the responsibility for it thats a managers job and what he does
2423612 we will just get up and get on with it to make sure we dont let it cause us a problem starting on sunday at falkirk
2423613 thats something we have to bear in mind more than anything else people can criticise managers players or whoever but now we have to make sure it doesnt create a more upsetting circumstance
2423614 none of the players playing for rangers right now have let anyone down
2423615 yes losing the european games was a big disappointment to everybody but if you take into consideration our overall achievements coming from where we were 18 months ago to where we are now then i dont think anybody can say theyve let anybody down
2423616 the players havent let anyone down everybody felt let down the other night the players the staff ourselves and we all take responsibility for that
2423617 but overall the vast majority of players in the group have handled playing for the club extremely well
2423618 i think the players that we have got coped quite well last season there is no reason to suppose that the players are now going to struggle simply because of one or two bad results
2423619 they showed last season they can handle that but like every other player and every other manager we now need to go out and do it again
2423620 ive been getting closer to writing things that could be called autobiographical
2423621 im finding stuff closer to me than i used to
2423622 thats 100 the truth i couldnt have made that up
2423623 i always hated the word irony but its the only word ive ever been able to use to describe what i do people are better about it now because there are more shows like the simpsons and the office the audience has become more sophisticated
2423624 when lyndon johnson was president there was this feeling that it was all going to work out
2423625 then this benign neglect kicked in but jackson kept going he was still writing about nuclear power in the 1990s
2423626 falta una copia de los pasaportes de los ni os debes sacar una y luego d rmela para que las lleve otra vez al ayuntamiento
2423627 ante esa situaci n procuren tener a mano sus papeles y pasaportes es lo mas importante que deben salvar
2423628 al principio cuesta convencer a los padres que sus hijos tiene que ir a la escuela para ellos un hijo representa una fuente m s de ingreso y por eso tampoco controlan la natalidad
2423629 la marginaci n en las escuelas es uno de los inconvenientes especialmente cuando los ni os van sucios o son violentos en algunas los han recibido bien pero en otras les han puesto pegas
2423630 la gente cree que porque los ni os est n en la carretera pidiendo limosna s lo est n ah para robar los rechazan y tienen miedo de ellos los medios de comunicaci n han hecho que la sociedad los estigmatice como peligrosos
2423631 un d a me dirig a a la iglesia y empez un tiroteo tuve que refugiarme detr s del contenedor de la basura
2423632 no podemos echarlos y aunque lo hici ramos no se ir an entonces debemos aprender a convivir con ellos
2423633 we have to play as a team and we have to win as a team
2423634 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2423635 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best our best no matter how many games we are behind
2423636 maybe half of the team dont have that mentality their only thing is to finish strong individually and put up numbers thats great but that affects us you know as a team that doesnt work out
2423637 you never want to be in this position especially for us as pitchers
2423638 if i go there and be hard on somebody im going to look bad
2423639 im going to look bad because people are going to say he cannot handle it when bad moments come
2423640 i dont know but felix and wash we are very competitive i can tell you very competitive i dont know if they feel the same way i do but im sure they are pretty close
2423641 with his history and competitive success we know he is going to come around we know it is going to get better
2423642 we are with him for the long haul he doesnt hang his head he feels terrible about the hits hes giving up the runs but the way hes getting after it is the way we want everyone to
2423643 if indiana jones wasnt in it youd have to call it
2423644 the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea
2423645 and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant come up with another object for him to chase hopefully well come up with something
2423646 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them
2423647 but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2423648 its the kind of thing thats a real head scratcher to find
2423649 our maintenance staff is working overtime this weekend to repair the elwha and trouble shoot the problem so that we can get this ferry back in service as soon as possible
2423650 we know that august is an awful time for this to happen in the san juan islands and we are working to minimize the impact as much as we can
2423651 existen opciones que contienen progest geno drospirenona que pueden ayudar al tratamiento del acn y del hirsutismo as como a evitar la grasa en la piel
2423652 a partir de la d cada de los 80 y hasta la actualidad se utilizan en mujeres con este trastorno un anticonceptivo oral en el que se combina el estr geno con una progesterona especial llamada acetato de ciproterona la cual produce una mejor a importante sobre el acn evidente a los pocos meses de iniciado el tratamiento
2423653 ive worked very hard to make lincolnton a great place to live if they can do a better job and the voters think so then so be it
2423654 i think the voters liked what we had to say
2423655 and they did a great service by coming out and voting tonight
2423656 i dont know if these results even mean anything because theyre so few people who actually voted
2423657 ive seen all these birds in my yard or the school yard
2423658 this is a terrible example for the students of the city
2423659 the school district is playing the role of a schoolyard bully
2423660 as long as these applications are not pending no city permits are required for removal of the trees as none of those trees constitute exceptional trees under city codes
2423661 the school district should stay within the regulatory process and act in good faith
2423662 we expect good stewardship of our trees from all our residents and from the school district
2423663 a woman who was minding her own business whose life was taken in an instant as you saw yesterday
2423664 martinezs driving was so bad and so dangerous even if he wasnt drinking and driving he would still be guilty of second degree murder
2423665 go home and kiss your loved ones because it could be over like that
2423666 this house is supposed to be a place where people come and enjoy it but its a home its family what better way to symbolize the governors mansion as home and family than to have a wedding
2423667 i hope that will signal to the partnership that they can afford to be a little bit bold here
2423668 there are lots of folks that are going to say its always feasible
2423669 theres going to be other folks that say theres only limited circumstances and heres why
2423670 simply to win political approval from snohomish county and to induce it to drop its objections to brightwater
2423671 and other capital projects unrelated to brightwaters actual impacts as the price for snohomish countys approval of brightwater use of king county funds for these extraneous purposes is not authorized by law and is not appropriate
2423672 we were focused on the brightwater project and things related to it to the environment and we told them thats what we needed to focus on
2423673 were still trying to piece things together and process the crime scene
2423674 growing up it has always been part of the culture
2423675 chinese we dont like the number 4 it is death
2423676 is that this is very deep in their culture all magical beliefs give a person a sense of control in an unpredictable impersonal and complex world
2423677 the principle of similarity lies at the root of many superstitions and magical thinking and the discovery of mirror neurons helps to explain that
2423678 in the case of the number 8 in china the word sounds like prosperity and thats where the brain makes the connection the similarity of sounds
2423679 from a scientific view i dont believe in the 4 or 8 thing
2423680 in real life if you ask me for my preference i pick 8
2423681 the car is going to act like its haunted if it could have been fixed it would have been fixed
2423682 lemon law resale notice of nonconformity or serious safety defect
2423683 this house is supposed to be a place where people come and enjoy it but its a home its family what better way to symbolize the governors mansion as home and family than to have a wedding
2423684 serves as just another confirmation that the zoos elephant breeding program is a tragic failure
2423685 if i could throw half as good as he does when im 38 id be happy
2423686 his arm feels good the biggest thing is to keep the rest of him going
2423687 are you kidding me it takes five innings to get ready to pitch one
2423688 used to be id grab a ball throw the ninth inning and go home not anymore its a lot of work but its worth it to be with this team going where we are
2423689 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2423690 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best maybe half of the team dont have that mentality
2423691 if i could throw half as good as he does when im 38 id be happy
2423692 his arm feels good the biggest thing is to keep the rest of him going
2423693 are you kidding me it takes five innings to get ready to pitch one
2423694 used to be id grab a ball throw the ninth inning and go home not anymore its a lot of work but its worth it to be with this team going where we are
2423695 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should play better than this
2423696 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best maybe half of the team dont have that mentality
2423697 it was a great way to start especially against them
2423698 theyve got a great defense and theyre strong up front weve had some trouble starting out well on the road in the past but i thought this was a great start and a lot to be happy about
2423699 considering he wasnt a center until three weeks ago id say he did fine
2423700 thats what the preseason is for to work these kinks out
2423701 there are things we need to improve on and this will be a good measuring stick
2423702 our first unit early on we moved the ball pretty well and kind of mistake free there
2423703 thats one of the things you look for in an early preseason game and i like the way we ran the ball
2423704 we feel very comfortable with our running game but we wanted to get our pass game a fresh start
2423705 when you heard that a rabbi was going to be speaking today how many of you expected somebody like me
2423706 i thought youd have one of those big huge hats curly sideburns and a torah
2423707 today all you get is me me with my goatee my rei jacket and a hint of a chicago twang im sorry to disappoint you
2423708 i knew the grease would probably catch fire pretty quick i needed to get help as fast as i could
2423709 but i woke up pretty fast once i realized what was going on
2423710 you could see some puffs of black smoke rising up over the house as soon as you got out the door
2423711 when i got that door open it was like a miracle
2423712 there was coal black smoke all around the house but it was like she had a halo around her none of the smoke got on her or in her lungs
2423713 it didnt matter what happened to me i would have lived on in another life but if something would have happened to her i couldnt have lived with myself
2423714 trailers like that generally only take about three to five minutes to burn completely down
2423715 in my 27 years of firefighting experience ive never seen anybody do anything like that thank god he did or things could have gotten very bad
2423716 its been the best and worst week of my life
2423717 i dont have any insurance and ive lost everything but without ed i would have lost the biggest part of my life
2423718 evidence that the police were collecting started to point to someone else
2423719 he was a really good guy and it was sad to hear what happened to him
2423720 he was friendly hard working and very nice he was just down on his luck
2423721 talking to friends when the car hit us the bus shook really hard and the back went up in the air and threw us all around everyone started screaming and crying
2423722 the back of the bus lifted in the air and it felt like it was going to tip over
2423723 but it fell back down and the bus driver starting asking if everyone was ok
2423724 its completely untrue ridiculous ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known

2423729 trophy hunters do not go after the very rare cougar that is causing a problem
2423730 im very grateful for my career but i worry for the girls after me for the opportunities they get the way they get treated and this is one of the reasons i still do what i do
2423731 i dont do so many shows anymore but i do count how many girls of color they use in the shows it happens to be last year new york was the worst
2423732 now at paris haute couture there was only one black girl out of all the shows it cannot be a trend
2423733 for me it is something that is history making something that im going to keep forever
2423734 without the program if someone were to skip bail and they have no social security card or identification card theres nothing we can do we have no way of keeping tabs on them
2423735 this program works because it gets the criminal element off of the streets but it also forces the government to do something with these people once we catch them
2423736 ice wants to make sure you are serious about the program and that you have the facilities population size and demographics that would necessitate having it
2423737 we are accountable and its something that they are assisting us with not necessarily the other way around
2423738 immigrants are beginning to see ice and the court system as the same entity
2423739 they are going to be less likely to call the police because theyre afraid they may be deported or they may have their citizenship questioned
2423740 weve been working hard to educate these communities about what the program is and what it does
2423741 they want to get rid of this criminal element as much as we do and these communities have shown a willingness to work with us so far

2423767 i was going well but had some problem with my body movement i sort of stabilised myself but that cost me some time and i was under pressure subsequently
2423768 i could not have shot faster in the first two series that would have hampered my rhythm but at the same time i had to speed up
2423769 i did not expect a miracle here but anyway its water under the bridge now
2423770 once i shot a nine in the third series it really unnerved me suddenly i realised i could not afford to make any more mistakes and that affected my subsequent performance
2423771 i think i lacked that mental strength the competition standard was in fact lower than say world cup but i just could not be in full control of my mind
2423772 still it was a good experience and now i know the areas i need to work on

2423785 perhaps in the olympic history people in the world have never before witnessed such a solemn modern unique and attractive opening ceremony nearly 20 items performed by chinese artists at the birds nest national stadium have thrilled viewers
2423786 the image of hundreds of boats on the silk road and strange stylized dances have made viewers think of the chinese boat going to the big sea
2423787 opening ceremony of beijing 2008 olympic games lights friendship and genuine sports spirit
2423788 under the talented guidance of director zhang yimou and wonderful performances a cultural flow through 5 000 years of the chinese history from the ancient to modern time is shown on grand and smooth music backgrounds
2423789 after seven years of preparation things chinese people expressed at the opening ceremony have conquered the whole world
2423790 the opening ceremony is a feast of solemn images praising itis unnecessary the performance has gone beyond imagination of both an ordinary person and a stage director
2423791 in my opinion the form of the beijing olympic games opening ceremony last night has reached a very high standard i dont know when we can do such a work regarding the content i and maybe many other directors realized that chinese people have sharply expressed the quintessence of their 5 000 year old culture by a very modern language
2423792 i wouldnt say its an easy job it can only get worse if you look at it that way
2423793 ive had more good days than bad days so far in my career i just have to keep enjoying myself and trying to improve but its no surprise that i keep improving because i wake up every single morning trying to get better
2423794 i didnt think so because before the game i still did the right things and the right amount of work i normally do
2423795 i just had to spend the extra time with the other players to build the confidence which kept me a little bit longer at training
2423796 but in terms of batting you just have to go out and bat you cant be a captain when youre batting you just have to go out to score as many runs as you can
2423797 i dont like to make mountains out of molehills i just like to be as simple as i can i built an innings played straight played in my areas played a few shots which were funky i suppose but just got on with it
2423798 it does mean more because of the scrutiny but in terms of me and how ive been playing i have been getting hundreds and scoring runs
2423799 in terms of my relationship with the players i have to keep growing that that has come on leaps and bounds in the four days i have been in charge
2423800 im getting to learn a lot more about how the guys operate and you have a really different perspective you really want them to do well for them for you the team its really a holistic thing
2423801 all you have to do is try you dont have to be perfect

2423814 thou shalt not kill for life is given to all by god and that which god has given let not man take away for i tell you truly from one mother proceeds all that lives upon the earth therefore he who kills kills his brother and from him will the earthly mother turn away and will pluck from him her quickening breasts and he will be shunned by her angels and satan will have his dwelling in his body and the flesh of slain beasts in his body will become his own tomb for i tell you truly he who kills kills himself and whoso eats the flesh of slain beasts eats of the body of death for in his blood every drop of their blood turns to poison in his breath their breath to stink in his flesh their flesh to boils in his bones their bones to chalk in his bowels their bowels to decay in his eyes their eyes to scales in his ears their ears to waxy issue and their death will become his death

2423820 the latest rasmussen reports telephone polls in the buckeye state shows republican frontrunner leading clinton by a statistically insignificant percentage point 44 to 43 clinton leads another republican hopeful fred thompson by the same insignificant margin 44 to 43
2423821 during election 2004 ohio narrowly cast its electoral college votes for george w bush providing him with the final votes he needed for re election two years later in election 2006 gop statewide scandals and the situation in iraq led democrats to victory in statewide races fifty two percent 52 of ohio voters say that democratic governor ted strickland is doing a good or an excellent job thirty two percent 32 say fair while 13 believe strickland is doing a poor job
2423822 quinnipiac university polls of voters in florida ohio and pennsylvania the big three electoral college swing states found voters by large margins more likely to see the endorsement of a gay rights group as a reason to vote against rather than for a candidate that is especially the case among independent voters often the key to winning these critical states and much more so among men than women and republicans than democrats the endorsement of abortion rights groups was a net negative although not as much among independents as the support of gay rights in ohio 10 percent of voters said being endorsed by homosexual activists would make them more likely 34 percent said less likely a more than 3 1 ratio among independent voters perhaps the key to the states 20 electoral votes 12 percent said it would make them more likely while 28 percent said less likely
2423823 more than 3 to 1 ratio of voter movement cited above
2423824 a chinese rights activist has been sentenced to four years in jail for subversion after posting politically sensitive essays on the internet his lawyer said friday
2423825 we think the sentence is totally unreasonable he was only expressing his opinion and that is within his rights under the constitution
2423826 it would be hard to view fred thompson as being hip deep in the republican presidential campaign
2423827 he also has to prove his critics some of them his friends wrong he has to show he isnt the lazybones hes been portrayed as being giuliani and romney are working hard as are some of the second tier candidates including mccain and huckabee
2423828 i like you as a friend and dont want to jepordise that by taking it any further
2423829 the national assembly session has been summoned at 5 00 pm 1100 gmt for monday

2423831 a notice for impeachment will be served on president musharraf during the session starting monday
2423832 not earlier than seven days and not later than 14 days
2423833 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed
2423834 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania

2423836 these people dont care about you and they dont care about your quality of life and they dont care about food safety and they dont care about true security
2423837 we are pleased to report a very strong second quarter with demand for gold reaching unprecedented levels in a number of markets
2423838 which candidates plan would give the largest tax cuts to the middle class
2423839 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family
2423840 forbes is right that obama voted for a resolution that would have allowed tax rates to return to their pre 2001 levels
2423841 placing too high a tax burden on business does two things causes some businesses to close down and increases costs to consumers neither of which are good for the economy
2423842 the big issue economically is whats going to happen to taxes
2423843 democratic nominee barack obama regularly professes disdain for the bush tax cuts suggesting that those growth spurring measures may be scrapped
2423844 the u s will go into a big recession a nosedive
2423845 this would be devastating to the world economy to the united states and it would be i think political suicide
2423846 the most important thing that could be done with respect to tax rates now is to make the bush tax cuts permanent eliminating that uncertainty would be more important than pushing for a further cut in the income tax rates anyway
2423847 but havent the tax cuts put more of the burden on the backs of the middle class and the poor no i examined the treasury department analysis of how much the rich would have paid without the bush tax cuts and how much they actually did pay the rich are now paying more than they would have paid not less after the bush investment tax cuts for example the treasurys estimate was that the top 1 percent of earners would pay 31 percent of taxes if the bush cuts did not go into effect with the cuts they actually paid 37 per cent similarly the share of the top 10 percent of earners was estimated at 63 percent without the cuts they actually paid 68 percent
2423848 so he still lied stupid what part of lie do you not understand
2423849 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
2423850 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution

2423856 the final outrage is that obi wan just leaves anakin to die so you re telling me that you re just going to walk away from the second most dangerous man in the galaxy without making sure he s dead it s not like obi wan wasn t aware that there is such a thing as prosthetics that just because anakin has been disarmed doesn t mean he can t be fairly easily rearmed hell anakin already had a prosthetic hand at that point you don t just leave someone like that alive it s absolutely ridiculous

2423861 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2423862 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2423863 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2423866 unification for the sake of unification is not the path we decided to go down
2423867 in the end what matters most is what consumers are looking for but having too many people on the design phase especially early on would have hurt the project you could have three different user interfaces and a couple of application layers that doesnt make sense
2423868 a lot has happened in the last 12 months to push us in this direction
2423869 from our perspective creating a platform in a mobile space is not like building for the pc with mobile you are fighting for every spare 500 kilobytes you can find we know because we are building handsets right now so instead of adding in compatibility for everything we think it is important to clarify for developers the best possible direction and make it open source so it is available to more people
2423870 to have some type of coalescence is necessary whether the application is a game or interacting with the cloud
2423871 we also work with microsoft and symbian and our interaction with other groups is helping with standardization in the industry
2423872 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2423873 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2423874 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2423875 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2423876 n sten alle par med uforklarlig barnl shed vil f en eller begge af disse behandlinger men ingen af de behandlinger er markant mere effektive end at fort lle parret at de blot skal g hjem og arbejde p det hvilket er meget billigere og mere sjovt
2423877 capitalize a noun followed by a number or a letter that indicates sequence exceptions
2423878 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2423879 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2423880 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2423881 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2423882 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them
2423883 we want people to change their behavior and use more water efficient products for landscaping
2423884 it never occurred to me that in a state that has an extreme water shortage every city wouldnt do everything they possibly could to save water
2423885 ill go ahead and take the state and national level i know some people on the city council here
2423886 turf or acceptable dry climate ground cover is allowed in the frontyard
2423887 i knew i was wrongfully accused i just had to wait it out
2423888 when we put it all together it became clear to me at that point there was reasonable doubt and in fact it was likely they didnt commit the crime
2423889 if someone is in custody improperly we have to release them as soon as possible
2423890 this is a case that weighed so heavily on my heart
2423891 every once in a while you have a case that just doesnt add up
2423892 they were in the wrong place at the wrong time
2423893 its nice every once in a while to see everyone is on the same page as to justice being done
2423894 he pretended to be wealthy but i noticed he used to show up hungry
2423895 his sports jackets smelled like they needed a visit to the dry cleaner he drove an old brown datsun or toyota it was hardly the car of a wealthy young man

2423900 there has been a sequence of missteps and failures and this is not the end they miscalculated the valuation of aol and this is the first time theyre admitting to it
2423901 for youtube from a user and consumption perspective it continues to gain market share and thats been a critical goal
2423902 there is still a risk and challenge in monetizing youtube and well have to see how it pans out but its still too early to tell
2423903 at any point moore may make a modification but at this point the regional forester is basically overriding all those decisions
2423904 each and every time you send people out to aggressively fight a fire you put their health and safety at risk
2423905 its causing extreme morale problems amongst the fire teams in california
2423906 theyre sitting on their hands unable to do their jobs or theyre going out on suppression assignments doing what they know to be the wrong thing
2423907 its driving our fire chiefs nutty out on the forests
2423908 if something were to go wrong with fire use those resources are already on other fires
2423909 it would not have been smart for us had it been approved on the forest anyway
2423910 did you ever think they could be dead pixels or if not idk

2423975 i was a plus size woman myself and i knew this was a market that was untapped when we started dabbling on the internet we found an incredible base of people around the country and throughout the world
2423976 we found a huge reach and a huge need we offer everything that a fredericks of hollywood or a victorias secret would have and more but for the plus size women
2423977 we carry specialized bras with sizes up to double d and we also go fuller than that
2423978 what are seemingly routine activities for most americans becomes an arduous and upsetting situation for the estimated 38 million americans who are significantly heavier than what is considered average i believe full figured women have a right to feel sexy too we have the right to shop for and purchase full figured and plus sized lingerie in the comfort and discretion of own homes
2423979 we realized we that need to put what we do for our clients into normal terms well use examples well show examples of other peoples stuff to give a better idea or send a link to a website to show someone what were talking about

2423992 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2423993 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2423994 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2423995 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2423996 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act

2424002 the first game in this kind of tournament is very tight and you have to compete
2424003 im very proud of them because the first game is never easy and you never know how it is going to be you train for three weeks and you try to find the right recipe about how the team will play it was important to get the three points

2424007 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2424008 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2424009 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2424010 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2424011 he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
2424012 we feel our reporting and our investigation have been vindicated
2424013 it took so long because edwards was just so bold in lying about it
2424014 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2424015 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2424016 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2424017 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2424018 the fact that we know we can access it means we can go forward with the architect to finalize the plans
2424019 even though the groundbreaking is going to be significantly delayed it allows us to start the process
2424020 we dont have all the details yet and we dont know exactly when well get our money back or if we get our interest back but its our understanding well get the principal back
2424021 theres going to be some resolution but its premature to be assuming that theres a truck thats going to be pulling up full of cash
2424022 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby
2424023 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2424024 i think people are searching for a sense of belonging we all are
2424025 baby boomers are aging out of these big houses they want smaller one level houses with limited yards that way they get privacy and reduced maintenance
2424026 if the management of the games goes well i think it will have a positive effect on chinas global diplomacy and confidence of the government it will likely make them more receptive to international cooperation and multilateralism
2424027 conversely if the government receives a lot of negative media coverage and the games are mismanaged or there is an incident it will only fuel the more xenophobic and less cooperative elements in the chinese government
2424028 it will spread over to the world and become an international nightmare because china will feel humiliated and this will add to that suffering
2424029 china will feel very defensive about the human rights issue and if anything it will start paying more attention to this issue and why it has attracted so much criticism from the rest of the world
2424030 the greatest potential change in chinas international situation may not be its orientation to the world but the worlds orientation to it
2424031 should conditions in beijing both in human rights and air quality terms continue to be poor
2424032 chinas ambition to be an attractive nation with soft power legitimacy will take a hit even in the developing world
2424033 there were some balls that should have been caught they were close to being routine ground balls that should have been outs we didnt make the plays he did his part but the defense failed him
2424034 the organization decided to put him in the bullpen for a change and to see how hed react and hes done great as for why hes done good i dont know maybe he doesnt have time to think about his outing hes tough and the quality of his pitches are good
2424035 matt dominguez you can see him getting better and better throughout the season
2424036 he faces tough pitching and takes good at bats hes doing outstanding
2424037 i talked to him after he threw out the first pitch
2424038 hes been helping minor leaguers for years he was the president when i was playing in the league in 1982 he knows that hes been a big influence not only in the south atlantic league but all leagues in the minors mr moss cares about the players he goes a step further from his own job and cares about the players and thats why he is who he is
2424039 they think its great but if they bust on me i bust on them right back
2424040 a lot of fun getting scrutinized from all our friends
2424041 when he told me it was in north carolina i thought no thats not good way too far away to zip up there on a weekend after much thought thats when i knew i had to be with him
2424042 i have my life going the way i want it to be i dont think what happens on the field will bother me that much
2424043 rattling off his dreams he said wouldnt it be cool if i could kick in the jaguars stadium and lo and behold his dreams came true
2424044 if not thats not a big deal ill get the classifieds somewhere and get out the highlighter
2424045 at this point im thinking of presenting a new formula to expand and launch a new perspective to raise the speed of the process
2424046 they call me a tyrant tyrants govern without laws were making laws and all those laws are for the benefit of the country
2424047 many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife
2424048 i dont know if im being naive but i dont feel that way
2424049 i have done a bunch of interviews and they are like were you nervous to throw the ball or let it loose
2424050 it always hurt to practice but it just didnt feel right
2424051 this is my 12th nfl camp and im not going to 12 more

2424069 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2424070 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2424071 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2424072 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2424073 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2424074 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2424075 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2424076 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2424077 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2424078 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2424079 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2424080 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2424081 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2424082 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2424083 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2424084 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2424085 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2424086 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2424087 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2424088 you like to win the first game they feel pretty good and we did that
2424089 but they cant feel real great because they made a number of errors that we can coach to but thats kind of what you want in a first game win the game but also correct some things in some meetings
2424090 we have had some trouble starting out on the road in the past but i thought there was a lot to be happy about
2424091 that will help me with my confidence and my playing and my game and just trying to go out here and contribute and be a part of this team
2424092 the hispanic population in buchanan county grew from 2 397 people in july 2006 to 2 980 in july 2007 a 24 percent increase the majority of the growth occurred in st joseph where a 21 percent jump was the largest by percentage in the nation
2424093 our peacekeepers and units subordinate to them are now carrying out an operation to force the georgian side to peace
2424094 another three died in overnight attacks altogether 15 peacekeepers have been killed
2424095 it was a little disconcerting to see all the problems with the signatures
2424096 the last couple of days ive been checking the registrations myself on the computer
2424097 i want at least one debate with all four candidates so that nancy pelosi has to answer for her record
2424098 one of the first things we need to do is hire a professional accountant to deal with those reports
2424099 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2424100 i think if hed take his shoes off hed be a stud
2424101 i think its fundamentally changed a lot of peoples views of the canadian economy
2424102 while the public sector jobs tend to carry decent incomes and spending power its the private sector that signals the economic turning points
2424103 i take that as a sign that young people were leaving the labour force because employment just wasnt available
2424104 i think well probably see some further softening in the labour market ahead further job losses and a rise in unemployment
2424105 i think in ontario and quebec were already in recession
2424106 that is the worrisome thing for canada its very hard for us to get by when americans just stop buying our stuff
2424107 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2424108 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly

2424141 i dreamt about this day since i was a little girl on a ranch in alaska
2424142 it was relaxed and romantic i wore a traditional wedding gown and diamonds and he wore jeans and a button down shirt tys definitely my perfect prince

2424144 the situation reached the point that georgian peacekeepers have been shooting at russian peacekeepers now women children and old people are dying in south ossetia most of them are citizens of the russian federation according to the constitution i as the president of the russian federation must protect lives and the dignity of russian citizens wherever they are those responsible for the deaths of our citizens will be punished
2424145 they are for each other like no one else on earth
2424146 i have no country to fight for my country is the earth and i am a citizen of the world
2424147 you will consider the question of ending the war as soon as possible
2424148 certainly before 31 december 1945 and in all probability before 1 november 1945 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2424149 to enable us to assess accurately the effects of the bomb the targets should not have been previously damaged by air raids
2424150 no man in our position and subject to our responsibilities holding in his hands a weapon of such possibilities could have failed to use it and afterwards look his countrymen in the face
2424151 its an expensive sport no doubt but the premiership is where everyone wants to be
2424152 it costs money because all the teams are good so do you have to spend yes are we prepared to spend absolutely
2424153 when you get to the premiership the level gets raised and you have to do it justice and we will do it justice
2424154 lets get promoted then not get relegated then let us be super competitive
2424155 lets not say champions league football because that is not realistic for now we would be spitting in the wind
2424156 things will take time and money and that will come
2424157 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

2424160 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2424161 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
2424162 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
2424163 i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
2424164 he gets to keep his love of learning alive the world is his classroom
2424165 this court was under pressure they did it to protect themselves and their reputation those judges want to be supreme court judges they want to move up theyre not going to do anything to upset their careers
2424166 educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd circuit
2424167 it preexisted this state it preexisted us parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning
2424168 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
2424169 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction
2424170 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful

2424172 hes kind of been in the shadows for a while this is his opportunity and he needs to make the most of it
2424173 julius didnt quite get the opportunities we wanted the way the game worked out
2424174 we wanted to see him run the football but it didnt work out that way
2424175 overall i think im going to like what i see but its really early
2424176 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2424177 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2424178 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2424179 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2424180 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2424181 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2424182 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2424183 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2424184 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much
2424185 you hit it right where youve looked whale away if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2424186 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2424187 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2424188 there were multiple points along this road where usa swimming usada and the u s olympic committee could have acted to prevent this situation or make it right once events had swung into motion
2424189 i dont care if we are 40 games behind we should have played better than this
2424190 maybe half of the team wants to do the best they can
2424191 take the starting rotation every time we cross that line we want to do our best no matter how many games we are behind but maybe half of the team doesnt have that mentality they are only thinking of finishing strong and to put up their numbers thats great but that affects us as a team that doesnt work out
2424192 maybe chief has to go and grab somebody from his neck and throw him into the wall and somethings going to change
2424193 im very close to doing that so write that down
2424194 instead of moving over a runner they want to get a base hit because of their numbers
2424195 instead of maybe looking for a ground ball they want to strike him out because of the numbers
2424196 its tough man its tough because you never want to be in this last place position because especially for us as a pitcher its going to kill you especially as a starting pitcher thats going to affect you so much
2424197 were not going to be happy with a couple of good performances in the lineup
2424198 the way he gets after it is the way we want everyone to do it
2424199 at times ill be bored at times ill be tired at all times though ill be happy
2424200 of course i dreamed of becoming an olympic volunteer i have a little brother back home who wishes he was me i want to make him proud
2424201 there are 1 3 billion people in china and only half a million volunteers
2424202 its our job to give out of towners directions to help sick and disabled people were taking this seriously

2424277 an upscale rental community with outstanding amenities designed to attract young professionals
2424278 we feel this brand new upscale community represents the highest and best use for the site
2424279 every town wants upscale professionals upscale retail upscale lifestyle centers
2424280 of course they took a flea market they dont want poor people and they dont want businesses that serve poor people
2424281 i dont know if it would hurt less if they had succeeded with a hockey arena
2424282 but to lose everything for an apartment complex that burns

2424295 theres a lot of free stuff out there so its like with anything how does fee compete with free
2424296 what weve found is adult users like television and they like the high quality video big screen format that can be located in the bedroom and its a perfect platform to watch with a partner
2424297 for us the big issue on the internet side is all these free tube sites and that hurts the broadcasting internet and dvd sales when you have all of these people putting up these sites stealing content and giving it away for free
2424298 what that tells us is that consumers are willing to pay a premium for television content but not premium internet content
2424299 the internet may provide a better value proposition for consumers theres a lot of free sites out there but those looking for more quality look at cable
2424300 i think watching tv online is a gateway to the future but im not so sure that its the way of the future

2424323 the idea behind lettuce link is that people should take care of their own communities

2424325 even on a surprisingly crazy week we used to get maybe 135 families and wed be so exhausted
2424326 people are having a heck of a time filling up their tanks and more and more its the middle class families who are struggling to make ends meet
2424327 we love lettuce link they show up and its like magic
2424328 the demand for food in general has gone up we just need every last bit of food we can get our hands on and this is as good as it gets
2424329 theres more and more interest because of the cost of food
2424330 people are freaked out over the cost of food and where their food is coming from
2424331 this is the first year that our volunteers are taking us up on the offer to reimburse their mileage in coming here
2424332 bees are responsible for one in three bites of food you eat

2424335 i can open my own door thank you very much
2424336 you look like you could use the seat more than me old man
2424337 i would rather be treated as an equal than treated as something less and treated with all these courtesies
2424338 i think its a nice gesture when people are willing to extend that courtesy forward to other people
2424339 it can be read both ways which is why its such a difficult thing to know how to react to
2424340 were in a moment when people look at this very differently so inevitably you have these tensions
2424341 whoever needs the help should get the help regardless of gender

2424343 my father used to remember things like the entire sajra e nasab family tree by heart
2424344 collecting this information is easy because i am invariably present on any event of the village
2424345 i take care of every one and do what ever i can and people of the village look after my family and me
2424346 i live on trust village folks share their personal secrets with me and even consult me like a family member while deciding the marriages of their children i have always kept my ears to the ground i register every bit of information but divulge only what is necessary and when asked for me each member of the community in jalla balla and their relations living elsewhere are equally honourable and they all care for me i know all those who have relations in our village
2424347 i still accompany the barats marriage processions and before that carry the messages to and fro but i think have to give up this duty because i am getting old i am also losing my eyesight and cannot see at night i have no issue who can carry on what i have been doing for all my like but i also see things are changing very fast may be newer generation will need services like mine
2424348 anybody who goes to the city does not come back gradually they sever their roots with the village

2424360 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2424361 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2424362 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2424363 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2424364 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2424365 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2424366 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody shoulda told him im a f in rock star
2424367 im like life aint fair chill baby girl my girl is here
2424368 getting the crowd excited for the second sequel to one of the cornerstones of his lauded catalog of classics rumors of the album began this january when but jays reps denied that the song was new
2424369 i walk into the dressing room and kanyes like lets do a record lets do this im like cmon man but you know i couldnt tell him no its his show that was the idea he wanted to perform a new record
2424370 we spoke about doing an album it just was premature
2424371 surprise n a it was bound to happen sooner or later
2424372 yeah i went green and 26s on the hybrid smoke so much green that i cant open up my eyelids

2424376 were in the works of doing a whole lot of very creative stuff
2424377 the whole album every song is a movie thats basically how it comes down i dont even have features on the album the first single is not even featuring chris brown and sean garrett its co starring chris brown and sean garrett thats what i have on this album its all stars basically its co starring people because its a movie every song is a movie creatively and conceptually i think people are definitely going to understand that this is something that was very creatively put together it took a minute but every song is very serious
2424378 we found pictures that we really loved on the computer and then we put them on the shirts and then we started designing them
2424379 it was all worth it because we got to see the jonas brothers
2424380 it was horrible when we went to the train station there was rats outside the park people were shoving each other there were a lot of fights
2424381 we wanted to get the best seats and we wanted to have fun camping out
2424382 well we go to hear their new songs too which was amazing the jonas brothers are worth camping out for any day
2424383 they really put everything they can into their music and they really love their fans so they deserve it
2424384 theyre great inspirations to kids theyre a very wholesome band and they put everything they can into it
2424385 only one of us could make it over the wall
2424386 when you make love to a woman you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life
2424387 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2424388 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2424389 i dont think the show is about being the best dancer
2424390 its almost becoming like a novel at this point like this generations a tale of two cities or oliver twist
2424391 didnt seem to fit the world that i thought stephenie meyer created
2424392 you see the punch coming that doesnt mean its not gonna hurt when it hits
2424393 theres no way to make everybody happy when i do one thing that a lot of people want theres always the opposite reaction
2424394 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2424395 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2424396 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2424397 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2424398 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2424399 i should have known that people would feel that way
2424400 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2424401 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2424402 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go
2424403 i got my artist tay dizm and ive already got his single beam me up featuring me and rick ross ive also got young cash coming out right now jay lyriq ive got a lot of stuff coming on my nappy boy label
2424404 i just worked on ciaras album me and kanye did it again we did another hook like two days ago
2424405 i got two records with t pain that are retarded
2424406 if you wouldve come to my wedding you would have heard the records at my reception everybody was going crazy its this one record we got thats called talk that its phenomenal everybody is like you rapping like that i been doing that its nothing for me
2424407 that record i wont put on my lp cause its so much of a smash
2424408 its so phenomenal you would be like well why wouldnt you put it on your record if its so much of a smash because i would give it to my sister my sister needs that record more than i would need that my sister which is missy if missy had that record shes gone shes gone
2424409 justice obviously was a huge record for us we took the ride the lightning and master of puppets concept as far as we could take it
2424410 there was no place else to go with the progressive nutty sideways side of metallica and im so proud of the fact that in some way that album is kind of the epitome of that progressive side of us up through the 80s
2424411 theres a certain kind of specific sound to that record peculiar sound whichever adverb you want to choose thats given it a kind of life of its own and a little bit of a vibe all its own there have been a lot of great musicians we admire whove come up and talked about what a great inspiration that album has been to them and to their sound its obviously awesome to be part of that that album also sent us on this whole other merry way because when we came back from touring on that record in 1989 we were like we have nothing more to offer on this side of metallica and that set us off on some other adventures when i think of the nine records weve put out its impossible for me to think of the music without thinking of the experience and when i think of the experience i have warm and fuzzy feelings but i also have questions obviously justice is well revered especially among a lot of our peers
2424412 that album songwriting wise it was just us really showing off and trying to show what we could do
2424413 weve jammed six riffs into one song lets make it eight lets go crazy with it i listen to some of that stuff and its pretty progressive sonically it has its shortcomings but that is the one where we were able to step forward from
2424414 we mixed that record while we were on the road
2424415 thats not an excuse for the way that it sounds but our ears were beat anywhere i go whenever i ask someone what their favorite record is someones bound to say justice its pretty great that across the line someone can jump into your history and feel comfortable
2424416 id have to go song by song i was just listening to 1997s reload and there are a couple of songs on there that i think are absolutely brilliant but as an album itself and as a time justice just isnt a good memory for me but those songs are good i have to try and erase the memory of that experience somehow and let the songs take me
2424417 its always the next one i think the forthcoming is great but theres always a better something the holy grail of guitar sounds i havent got there yet but i will on the next one ill write the ultimate song on the next one the hunger is always there to do it better
2424418 i dont have an excuse i just need a little help
2424419 due to various reasons it wasnt working out with us and him
2424420 we felt his heart was no longer in it after expressing his want to leave on numerous occasions this year which showed when he played live

2424429 people have different opinions on that type of thing i told you what mine is and i think for each person you do whats right for you for me part of the reason that i have anxiety is the fact that i feel like people are always staring at me so its important for me to make sure that i have my friends and vacation and what i do at home with my family and that type of thing stays private

2424435 aquellos que abogan por el vih y la salud global tienen suficientes enemigos comunes el m s importante de ellos es la complacencia pol tica y los recursos humanos y financieros inadecuados
2424436 en la lucha por el reconocimiento del cuidado de la salud como un derecho humano somos socios naturales
2424437 si la urgencia del sida y la gran magnitud de las p rdidas humanas que experimentamos en la actualidad no es suficiente para obligarnos a suministrar aunque sea el nivel m s b sico de cuidado de la salud a aquellos que viven en pa ses de bajo ingreso entonces nosotros como comunidad global estamos moralmente quebrados

2424541 what about the hanes boxer briefs i asked for did you get those

2424563 okay get your drinks get in your pairs and start asking the questions provided and everyone please keep an eye on mad dog well probably have to shut him off in about twenty minutes
2424564 well my partner was manny ramirez he plays baseball for the boston red sox his favorite food is peanuts
2424565 his pet peeve is people who dont like the number twenty four and the one thing he would most like you to know about him is that if he could be any animal than he would be a squirrel
2424566 thees is my new fren alex he play for the yankees
2424567 uhh his pet peeve is all who make fun a him and the one thing he want you to know about him is that he is not gay
2424568 okay um that was interesting next up kobe and tom
2424569 my partner was tom brady he plays qb for the patriots his favorite food is
2424570 uh yeah his pet peeve is anyone who likes peyton manning and the one thing he wants you to know about him is that hes had more women in his life than youve had all time in your imagination
2424571 cant argue with that just kidding peyton you the man
2424572 okay my partner was kobe bryant he plays basketball for the lakers and is most known for his comparisons to michael jordan
2424573 his favorite food is wheaties and his pet peeve is when anyone sucks at anything and he is good at it which is everything that annoys him uh what mark
2424574 i think i speak for everyone when i say that no one has ever compared kobe to michael jordan or ever will thank you
2424575 bullshit i hear it everyday in the paper on the internet
2424576 the one thing that he would like you to know about him is that hes liked gambling and hanes underwear his entire life and doesnt like it just because michael jordan does
2424577 peyton the man is on the colts and is a qb dare i say hes better than tom
2424578 his favorite food is football because he eats it for breakfast and dinner uh did i get that right peyton
2424579 aw dude im sorry i didnt mean that man i messed it all up im sorry
2424580 dude rocket im so sorry i must have ate too many yodels dude im so sorry
2424581 okay ladainian you need to finish yours and rogers you have to do it you just have to sorry
2424582 its okay roger didnt answer any of my questions anyway he just kept telling me vizios sucked and sometimes he thought i might be retarded he didnt mean it though guy had like three beers i think he was crazy but about me shucks where do i start i learned the value of hard work and being classy early on i was barely walking and already i was running around the yard little football helmet on working out and being polite i was always trying to get better and i was polite to everyone in my town they all knew me as polite classy ladainian i used to get so many free cookies
2424583 ladainian did you know this show is sponsored by sony
2424584 what do you mean why would they pick sony over vizio
2424585 are you seriously from like a comic book universe where they injected you with vizio and classy juice is that why you always talk about that stuff i would seriously believe you if you said that was true
2424586 i think its somewhere down here lets try down the hall
2424587 maybe thats why he woke up at one o clock today do you think hes sad he got let go by the steelers
2424588 well no sense in worrying about it now lets take this booze upstairs and par tay

2424591 11 songs i think should have made vh1s greatest songs of the 90s
2424592 but the way they said some of these things happen it could be a lot worse this is really the best case scenario
2424593 hope so got to hope so and work to get back but well see im trying to get back before that so i can practice
2424594 my thought is we have a guy like mitch and a guy like aaron that can jump in and take their shots at this thing until marks back in here and battling with them
2424595 this is an opportunity and how we deal with it and how we handle it is important not the fact that something happened
2424596 these two guys are more on the athletic side they really like to get out of the pocket and do things out of the pocket
2424597 we hate that it happened we hate for it to happen like that especially but we got an opportunity today to kind of show what we could do and had to take care of it
2424598 report all suspicious persons and activities to the police department
2424599 take up everything as an art and try to be an artist only then will success see you
2424600 now for the special news my partner of 19 years and i are getting married in october we are asking you to help defeat proposition 8 which could annul our marriage if passed by making a donation in our names to eqca equality california we are listed on their online wedding registry

2424610 the split decision overturned a previous court ruling and has temporarily denied attempts by tribes and environmental groups to stop arizona snowbowl ski resort from expanding development and making fake snow from treated sewage effluent on the holy mountain
2424611 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2424612 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2424613 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2424614 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2424615 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2424616 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2424617 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2424618 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2424619 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2424620 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2424621 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2424622 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2424623 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2424624 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2424625 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2424626 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2424627 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2424628 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2424629 halls of justice painted green money talking power wolves beset your door hear them stalking soon youll please their appetite they devour hammer of justice crushes you overpower
2424630 one is frustrated this has taken so long then there is a sense of pride im seeing what has happened it was worth the wait
2424631 we knew where he was and he knew where we were
2424632 of course a lot of the trail wasnt finished we had to bushwhack
2424633 this has more enduring social value than a round of golf
2424634 i was going broke buying film because arizona is so beautiful
2424635 every time i saw a cactus i was taking a picture
2424636 the best jobs i have are the ones i dont get paid for
2424637 is unreasonably broad unenforceable provides no administrative appeal process puts the nation at a competitive disadvantage and fails to address the real problem on the navajo nation of underage smoking
2424638 the revenue generating potential is huge and we simply cannot afford to risk this potential with well intended legislation that will put the nation at a competitive disadvantage
2424639 we had hoped the president would sign the bill into law
2424640 in previous years and more recent the presidents activities and words in public seemed to indicate that he would be in favor of such a measure
2424641 so this isnt the last day for this kind of measure
2424642 im very disappointed that the president of the navajo nation has vetoed this landmark legislation
2424643 he of course knows that it is all about the health of the navajo people but hes basically putting money before health
2424644 i would do whatever it takes to improve the management of the elections division
2424645 they had two meetings where you could go and ask a question but there were no department heads present
2424646 from what ive observed he leads the board not the other way around
2424647 until the judge tells us what to do these people are not going to get this horse
2424648 set a regional and national standard for preservation of the environment
2424649 the limiting resource in our region is not land it is water
2424650 the health care delivery system regionally and nationally is not working
2424651 it seems even the most ruthless of smugglers would figure out that killing your cargo is bad economics
2424652 it just surprised us a little bit how long that small an amount of mercury can stick around in carpet
2424653 it depends on your family situation if youve got young children in the home then i would strongly recommend considering pulling out the carpet
2424654 i have to have at least 20 of them in my house
2424655 if i have to go through that once or twice a year with the money i save its worth it
2424656 i think this technology is phasing out its an interim technology

2424659 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2424660 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2424661 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2424662 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2424663 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2424664 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2424665 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2424675 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
2424676 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2424677 when you crawl in bed with someone you not only need to think about your wife and kids
2424678 but you need to think how it affects the livelihood of people who are in the trenches and stand on the porches of voters and say it cant be
2424679 had this party in his hands he was wildly popular and all the time in the back of his head he knew the other shoe would drop
2424680 how do you go out and ask people to be part of your vision
2424681 egregious even predatory because his wife was suffering from a very serious condition and nationally they put themselves out there as the family
2424682 whats particularly disturbing is that john edwards put himself out there as a populist an angry fighter for the ordinary person whom politicians have been so out of touch with
2424683 he was their guy their champion the person who would give them a voice
2424684 the idea for many democrats was that he and obama would stay together and he would end up as attorney general
2424685 hell be lucky if he gets away with his car his hairbrush and his travel bag
2424686 i dont think theres any coincidence he decided to put this out between news regarding the trade of quarterback brett favre and the beginning of the olympics late on a friday afternoon
2424687 the story was a fire that either had to be extinguished or as the case turned out to be the damage limited by getting this out right now
2424688 engaging in the proverbial casting of stones by those living in glass houses
2424689 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2424690 it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2424691 many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife
2424692 unlike any politician who had ever run for president in the history of the land
2424693 follow this wherever it goes and peel this guy like an onion
2424694 a state in which no more can be said or done
2424695 1000 places to see before you die a travelers life list
2424696 at this point im thinking of presenting a new formula to expand and launch a new perspective to raise the speed of the process
2424697 they call me a tyrant tyrants govern without laws were making laws and all those laws are for the benefit of the country
2424698 enough the phony leaders dead end movements and culture of failure that are undermining black america and what we can do about it
2424699 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2424700 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2424701 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2424702 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension

2424707 masterpieces of the past are good for the past they are not good for us we have a right to say what has been said and even what has not been said in a way that belongs to us a way that is immediated and direct corresponding to present modes of feeling and understanding able to everyone
2424708 the bourgeois theatre is the finished theatre the bourgeoisie knows what the world is like and it able to present images of this complete and finished world
2424709 when a people are corrupted playhouse are good for them and that when that people are uncorrupted playhouses are bad
2424710 the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth
2424711 comic and tragic actors are not the same yet these things are but imitations
2424712 if madness is forbidden then neither may they copy the behavior of a madman
2424713 it is precisely for its backwardness that the opera going public adores opera an influx of new types of listener with new appetites has to be reckoned with and so it is

2424721 the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter
2424722 democracy is a form of government that substitutes election by the inept many for appointment by the corrupt few
2424723 a variety of industry analysts in the ecommerce space advocate improving personalization offering secure buying options and providing quick transactions to turn visitors into customers
2424724 etailers need intuitive products that can impact conversion rates interspire products wrap all the features and options needed into one package so our customers can get up and running quickly and sell more
2424725 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2424726 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2424727 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2424728 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them
2424729 give russia the message that invading the territory of a sovereign state and bombing its territory is unacceptable in the 21st century
2424730 the latest tragic developments should become the last step toward the recognition of south ossetias independence

2424735 theres nothing to worry about the park is completely safe
2424736 it is a trap if anybody tried to protest at these parks they will be arrested
2424737 maybe they felt that with the opening ceremony happening it was not an appropriate time to protest
2424738 are you a newbie or an established name with an audience
2424739 if you are a newbie are you writing fiction or non fiction
2424740 if you are writing fiction do you have a niche market ready and willing to buy the book
2424741 i write sci fi and there is a huge market for sci fi therefore ill self publish
2424742 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2424743 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
2424744 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
2424745 i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
2424746 he gets to keep his love of learning alive the world is his classroom
2424747 this court was under pressure they did it to protect themselves and their reputation those judges want to be supreme court judges they want to move up theyre not going to do anything to upset their careers
2424748 educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd circuit
2424749 it preexisted this state it preexisted us parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning
2424750 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
2424751 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction
2424752 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful
2424753 the people supported him the only ones who didnt were organized crime and officials in state government
2424754 when citizens are desperate for security they will often trade their liberties and due process
2424755 and in the end may create a monster that is as dangerous as the other threat they are concerned about

2424757 it appeared i was put in front of the inquisition and left to be burned at the stake or sent to the firing squad
2424758 its in absolutely nobodys interest to have armed conflict and we hope everyone will realize that quickly
2424759 we can try to get them talking and to stop shooting
2424760 dont want to have a major conflict with the united states over this
2424761 georgia is an important partner for the united states in the caucasus probably the most important
2424762 obviously were not going to march in over the hill to help the georgians
2424763 part and parcel of israels colonial system of oppression against the palestinians
2424764 playing a key role in promoting close alliance between the united states and israel
2424765 whilst we are striking over fair pay students and workers in britain should unite and show solidarity with our palestinian comrades at every opportunity who live in effective open air prisons and denied of basic material security
2424766 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2424767 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2424768 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2424769 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2424770 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2424771 those who take the first step and sign up for individual welfare reform would then be provided with the four other steps of opportunity by government and the private sector
2424772 only about five people outside of my family know i make tunes i think i hope

2424777 i have written to the home secretary because shrewsbury prison repeatedly tops the league for being the most overcrowded prison in the country
2424778 it places undue pressure on wardens in their roles and also the whole infrastructure of the prison
2424779 unless something is done about this urgently i will be calling for a debate on it in parliament
2424780 the government is simply not building enough prisons in the country
2424781 they have got to invest in more prisons because if they dont what is happening is we are seeing extra pressure put on the management of these prisons and prison officers having to deal with more people than they would normally but also the early release of prisoners
2424782 magistrates are less willing to give prison sentences knowing there is no space for prisoners

2424790 you are very toned so taut yet curvy you probably dont run everyday
2424791 i bet when you exit your shower or bath you walk around your apartment naked just passing windows devoid of shade or curtains pouring a cup of coffee in the kitchen or checking your bookcase for something to read yes just casually nibbling on an apple scanning the newspaper giving others something to look at
2424792 i remembered the first time i wrapped my leather around the smooth throat of a woman i had brought a young lady home who needed a place to stay a retreat from a bothersome roomate i met her at a coffeehouse and she looked like a sad little mouse mindy sat in a corner barely registering with reality everytime she sipped her cofee or took a bite from her bagel it was a struggle for her to keep from crying so delicate mindy was so much in need of a friend i invited myself to sit down and she shared so much with me now i know that sounds incredulous given that we were strangers as you and i are but mindy had a vulnerability that she couldnt hide i took her hands into mine and soaked up her sorrow my ears cradled her words as my hands did her face she needed an escape and i wanted to take her in at first mindy was reluctant even after all of my assurances i swear at one point our faces were so close then mindy retreated into her shell and scurried away
2424793 there is nothing called mind to mind transmission at all in zen buddhism
2424794 no make it take it slap two zip game to eleven hey youre pretty good at this for a beginner
2424795 what the hell i still have one more freaking day until i can look forward to the weekend this is bull
2424796 we need to reach out to independents and old guard andnew reagan what we used to call reagan democrats and some that you might call clinton democrats as well
2424797 people see this old fool and have no idea thats going to happen
2424798 at first theyre a little quiet but it becomes an icebreaker after they get it
2424799 we never intended to have a home with a garden we intended this be a home in the garden a fanciful place and what i get to do here is anything that strikes my imagination
2424800 i take easy to maintain common plants that would be boring by themselves and put them together in interesting combinations i have a drawing on my wall using white and yellow daisies blue agapanthus gray dusty miller and blue salvia in front of ornamental grasses well all of those are very common ive made mistakes but ive been more surprised at how things can fit together
2424801 i have a good time imagining things in the garden that would be beautiful to look at and i try to build them
2424802 it was really hot and i was able to take every lily pad leaf and decide whether to keep it the fish would come up and id feed them bugs off the lily pads how can you explain being in a fly fishing floaty in the middle of a pond feeding your fish if someone walks by theyd think youre totally nuts the pond looked like a monet painting when i finished so how do i complain about a life like that
2424803 the little girl got a tour of the garden from a real troll you see its not the gardening thats so significant its the things that happen in it like the little girl visiting its things like getting a peach pie out of my peaches
2424804 i actually really liked it it was a good combination of sweet and salty
2424805 chefs are trying to be more playful and incorporate new kinds of whimsy
2424806 we brought it down to the boardwalk and put it in a case just to see if people would react and they reacted
2424807 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good
2424808 years ago i think food tended to be more traditional and less fun
2424809 its the melding of both these worlds the high end and the low end
2424810 it is suggested that this be done by allowing the mother to work part time or on reduced hours for a number of weeks or months after the maternity leave period and to include those working in the private sector
2424811 a more comprehensive review of the income tax act is necessary to move towards separate tax computations without having just one head of household in charge of income tax related matters

2424813 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2424814 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2424815 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2424816 recently my mother was diagnosed with breast liver and bone cancer given the intensity of her treatments and failing health i started selling healthy xocai chocolate not only to help my family out of our extreme financial hardship but to also show others that it can be done
2424817 i went from collecting and selling aluminum cans for cash to building my own healthy chocolate business i dont want people feeling sorry for me i want them to be inspired by what can be done when you put your mind to it
2424818 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2424819 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2424820 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective

2424823 without such information an attack is unlikely to significantly delay irans mastery of enrichment with gas centrifuges
2424824 irans decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex
2424825 considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2424826 an emphasis on military responses to this conflict has the effect of discouraging iran from allowing more effective iaea inspections something necessary for the successful conclusion of a diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program
2424827 iran is understandably concerned that more transparency on its part could lead to the u s and israeli militaries gaining better targeting information on its nuclear program
2424828 it is time to set aside the military option and concentrate instead on credible diplomatic approaches to end irans growing nuclear weapons capabilities
2424829 could prompt iran to hasten its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons by embarking on a crash program
2424830 iran could then build a small centrifuge plant at a secret location capable of producing weapons grade uranium for one or two nuclear weapons per year

2424843 ive been living in this community for 48 years and this is about the sorriest piece of scum ive ever seen come down the road
2424844 one of the programs we do which is all based on job training and employment of teenagers and artists in the city called artworks and its a mural works project and we painted 17 murals around the city
2424845 the artist scott donaldson presented four different designs and from there the group voted unanimously to select this design
2424846 i think they should act very quickly in getting this covered up and put a mural up there that would associate something of interest to this community
2424847 some of the elements depicted represent businesses and the history of the community
2424848 the cow that beautiful cow is the cow that was lost and roaming through that left the stockyard
2424849 and the pigs represent the meatpacking industry and of course thats a nod to cincinnati in general and our rich history
2424850 schenzs costume design is obviously a reference with the gown and the gorilla
2424851 and the name camp washington with the face of george washington and jacobs manufacturing with the robot
2424852 its art and thats what art is supposed to do its to inspire you to start a new conversation and get creative things going

2424862 i am not aware of anything that happened you will have to wait for bainimarama to return
2424863 like with any magazine crave will have its own unique style and personality which will ultimately be shaped and moulded by our readers feedback
2424864 we aim to provide stimulating and informative articles on a diverse range of subjects and not just entirely gay related after all there is a lot more to life than just sexuality and
2424865 just because a woman is gay doesnt mean that everything she reads has to be gay related
2424866 we have tried to put together a publication that is entertaining good fun and will be a great coffee table read
2424867 people have been incredibly enthusiastic so far and those who have seen samples have been really impressed
2424868 retail giants marks amp spencer are advertising extensively in crave the first time they have ever advertised in a gay publication
2424869 the intent is to support existing sports in the area
2424870 i thought it would be an incredible financial boon to the area
2424871 she has an intimate understanding of the framework which guides the city in several key areas including growth management critical areas protection and shoreline planning kathy has also won the respect of staff and community members alike for her thoughtful and professional approach to planning and public involvement
2424872 promoting a qualified internal candidate gives us a chance to preserve continuity enrich our in house knowledge base and make a statement about the way we value our staff
2424873 as interim director she has already made a significant impact i look forward to her continued contributions
2424874 its entirely unfortunate that three city councilors chose to ignore the citizens constitutional right to initiative
2424875 my dilemma as a councilperson is not being able to ignore 1 100 signatures
2424876 a significant number of people took the time to talk to mr van dyk and sign the petition
2424877 i really believe we cannot lawfully honor this petition because we just do not have the legal authority at this time to entertain initiative and referendum votes
2424878 when we get legal advice from three different sources we should follow that
2424879 this is a broad issue that goes well beyond bainbridge island
2424880 we decided to take a good hard look at ourselves
2424881 we knew we needed to bring our expenses in line with our revenues and show the taxpayers that we are responsible stewards of their dollars we have taken some real cost cutting measures and the good news is that we have brought the deficit down to 650 000 our goal is to totally balance our budget for 2009 unfortunately some of those cuts will affect the services we offer our patrons
2424882 our board of trustees is now looking toward the possibility of a november 2009 ballot initiative we are extremely sensitive to the current economic climate we too are making difficult economic choices
2424883 the inside secrets of how to achieve life changing goals revealed
2424884 the archbishop of canterbury is willing to include and embrace homophobes within the anglican communion but we all know that that he would never seek a similar accommodation with racists and anti semites
2424885 the anglican churchs current divisions over homosexuality are a re run of its previous divisions over evolution and votes for women
2424886 now as then truth and justice will triumph despite the contrary efforts of the church leadership
2424887 since becoming archbishop of canterbury rowan williams has become a prisoner of the lambeth palace mafia
2424888 they have jailed his heart and soul he now puts preservation of the institution of the church before love of his fellow gay christians and before the dignity of lesbian and gay people
2424889 church unity is more important to him than gay equality
2424890 archbishop williams welcomed hardline homophobic bishops to the lambeth conference but not bishop gene robinson he wont reply to bishop robinsons letters
2424891 yet he readily meets anti gay bishops he has taken a partisan stance against the defenders of gay equality and in collusion with the persecutors of gay people like archbishops
2424892 by his attempts to accommodate homophobic bishops dr williams brings shame and dishonor to the office of archbishop of canterbury he has betrayed his own conscience turning back on his years of courageous compassionate support for gay inclusion and equality
2424893 his failure to stand up to anti gay bullies within the church is a failure of moral and ethical leadership
2424894 he is no longer the rowan we once knew i dont know how he sleeps at night
2424895 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2424896 this find will open up an area of paleontological research in the area
2424897 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton like this is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2424898 i want the international olympic committee ioc not to forget that many kosovo athletes met the olympic criteria for travelling to beijing
2424899 they could not take part at these olympics this year but do not forget them lets motivate them by providing the unique olympic opportunity for the best among them in four years
2424900 for 64 percent of those questioned membership in the eu is the most important issue
2424901 attacks on economic interests have a deterring effect on turkey as long as the turkish state insists on war such acts will naturally be carried out
2424902 has required us to boost our resistance in self defense
2424903 this is a very important and unprecedented instance in the annals of greek justice
2424904 more than half of greeks do not know how to swim elsewhere in europe children learn to swim in pools from a very young age but in greece its something one learns alone
2424905 other countries have a policy on the issue in spain for instance the number of drownings decreased spectacularly within a few years because they adopted a comprehensive approach
2424906 most drownings i have seen were due to pathogenic causes such as heart failure or high blood pressure affecting older people such cases are usually fatal young people usually escape death but in talking to them i found that their swimming knowledge was not adequate
2424907 i am followed every single second wherever i go whatever i do whoever i meet
2424908 i came here only to refresh memories of my childhood and that dream was killed by the montenegrin government
2424909 i have a wife five kids eight grandkids in america and i have never been in jail in my life
2424910 he turned out the lights and played mozart and beethoven we found it all very funny
2424911 he would play flight of the bumblebee and had us imagine the bee flying in the dark some people slept some made jokes
2424912 they were completely different people the man who worked for the sarajevo soccer team and the war criminal
2424913 during the first days of the war i just kept thinking how was it possible that it was the same man
2424914 at the time he was a person with no interest in politics
2424915 undoubtedly karadzic was a good communicator he knew how to approach people he did favors for them
2424916 although after spending enough time with him it was obvious he was not much of a man but you could never think of him as a criminal
2424917 i liked him and enjoyed his company we frequently met at the cafe and talked about soccer and our families
2424918 but he was always talking too much about money how to get money and for others to lend him money
2424919 i would like to remind everyone that it was i who went to the supreme court prosecutor asking for an investigation which will lead to the bottom of the case
2424920 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2424921 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2424922 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2424923 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2424924 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2424925 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2424926 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2424927 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2424928 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2424929 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2424930 hes in the gray area but hes not definitely ineligible as we speak
2424931 thought he was going to be ineligible yesterday today we discover hes not
2424932 hes still alive and the reason he is theres a chance they may not have to do an appeal
2424933 not very much wed be short a talented player but hes got some people playing ahead of him right now so well play those and develop others
2424934 its irrelevant because if you dont make it in the classroom you dont get on the field its not even relevant were not going to rep him until he can get on the field
2424935 i knew for sure that i was going to pass because with the coaches and tutors and stuff around i had no choice but to do great i did great and now im here and i can focus on football at this point and get ready for this national championship
2424936 i really appreciate everything everybodys saying but at the same time im very humble i always have to work hard ive got work hard hard hard and thats what i want to do i want to please the fans i want to please the people in lubbock i want to please everybody around here and let them know that im here and im a red raider for life
2424937 not saying we dont go hard but all of us are physically fit weve all been working out together as one and i feel really good on the field
2424938 and i told him come in do your job and compete its an open competition its not donnies a starter automatically and hes done that hes worked his butt off all summer and hes gotten a lot better
2424939 it definitely helped me focus more knowing there was going to be competition coming in its a job that i want doing field goals and stuff so it definitely kept me focused all summer
2424940 donnies showed a lot of calm and coolness right now for a freshman
2424941 he had one bad day came back and was perfect the next day hes got a great leg and hes a pleasure to coach he works his butt off he wants to be great
2424942 tcu does it but with their quarterback in morriss spot
2424943 we may discard it we may keep it i dont know we think its worth messing with
2424944 danny and eric talk quite often so theyll kind of compete to see who can catch the most
2424945 according to eric dannys only gotten five his arms are a little short
2424946 it all sounds the same to me so we stick to solid rock we will never follow trends
2424947 we want to get some gigs put out a decent demo and maybe do a british tour
2424948 and we always put on a really good live show
2424949 we didnt like having the first three letters of that name associated with the band
2424950 ive been playing for 10 years in lots of different bands and this is the first one ive been in where everything just clicks
2424951 it just feels like everything fits into place like things are just coming together i havent felt like that about the band before
2424952 some of our songs are pretty heavy i mean we are on the verge of being a metal band but we dont go that far
2424953 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2424954 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2424955 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2424956 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2424957 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2424958 he jugado la mejor temporada de pista dura de mi vida hasta el momento
2424959 ser n mero uno es un regalo por tanto trabajo realizado en el pasado

2424967 if brett favre is a brat then what does that make john elway both quarterbacks wanted to play football and wanted their own way both men ended up forcing a teams hand favre did so at the end of a distinguished nfl career elway did so as an unproven draft choice so whos the bigger brat
2424968 it was terrible when the broncos let kicker jason elam go but this treatment of john lynch is my last straw in the love for the team the way coach mike shanahan treats players irritates me i hope the teams where elam and lynch john elway cried when he retired from the nfl but was man enough to stick to his word denver post file photo are this season beat the broncos
2424969 team sports are all but dead everyone is playing for himself from lynch to shanahan i will be displaying a new bumper sticker ex bronco fan the little czar has gone too far
2424970 whats really disturbing is many of these developments with the rockies were foreseeable at last years world series franklin morales looked like a scared rookie who wouldnt blossom jeff francis looked very beatable clint hurdle looked too conservative to guide a team with big expectations despite all that the rockies had a chance to trade for some great arms either in the offseason or in july yet sat idle
2424971 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2424972 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2424973 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2424974 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2424975 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2424976 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2424977 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2424978 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2424979 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2424980 the fact that we know we can access it means we can go forward with the architect to finalize the plans
2424981 even though the groundbreaking is going to be significantly delayed it allows us to start the process
2424982 we dont have all the details yet and we dont know exactly when well get our money back or if we get our interest back but its our understanding well get the principal back
2424983 theres going to be some resolution but its premature to be assuming that theres a truck thats going to be pulling up full of cash
2424984 our method appears to be the most efficient conversion of cellulose into simple hydrophobic organic compounds described to date
2424985 it also surpasses the carbon yields of glucose and sucrose fermentation furanics could be established as both the automotive energy source and chemical starting material of the future
2424986 if the management of the games goes well i think it will have a positive effect on chinas global diplomacy and confidence of the government it will likely make them more receptive to international cooperation and multilateralism
2424987 conversely if the government receives a lot of negative media coverage and the games are mismanaged or there is an incident it will only fuel the more xenophobic and less cooperative elements in the chinese government
2424988 it will spread over to the world and become an international nightmare because china will feel humiliated and this will add to that suffering
2424989 china will feel very defensive about the human rights issue and if anything it will start paying more attention to this issue and why it has attracted so much criticism from the rest of the world
2424990 the greatest potential change in chinas international situation may not be its orientation to the world but the worlds orientation to it
2424991 dig his heels in for a fight and bank on the army high command he should read the writing on the wall and quit immediately
2424992 everyone will be a loser the country most of all
2424993 there were pro musharraf leaders in the party for instance mr amin fahim but there were also those who hated his guts for instance senator raza rabbani
2424994 needed an acceptance of its economic performance at the mass level on the basis of party loyalties
2424995 so it decided that if it could bring the pml n back into the cabinet it could weather the public storm against rising prices and the universal complaint of a
2424996 after sindh where the ppp wants to consolidate itself by indirectly opposing the mqm it is balochistan where the ppp sees itself emerging as a credible arbiter of extremist politics by dumping president musharraf
2424997 because it is to be done by a joint session of parliament while removing article 58 2 b doesnt because it has to be done by separate 2 3rd votes in each of the two houses
2424998 it was scared of mr sharif but now it may also be fearful of mr zardari
2424999 beyonce knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2425000 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonce
2425001 skin is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
2425002 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process
2425003 a central clause of the players central contract has been violated so a ban for a certain number of matches is likely
2425004 nothing is final as yet but we are holding talks to secure the services of dr durgan
2425005 i dont think so because doping offences are the sole responsibility of an individual asif is responsible if he has failed a dope test in the ipl not the board and i dont think his actions reflect on our cricket
2425006 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys the daily telegraph quoted terian as saying
2425007 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2425008 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2425009 and watching him the boys would scream and say watch the child jesus what he does over the waves of the sea many would gather there and watching him would be amazed
2425010 but the apocryphal story shows that for a ball game even jesus would forget work and would go to have fun with the boys he said
2425011 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2425012 this could be what underlies addiction dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2425013 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2425014 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2425015 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2425016 people of china have every right to host the games olympics because these people the majority of them are not exposed to such openness and such ceremonies and they should enjoy this kind of ceremony but at the same time what we are worried about is that a lot of people are still subject to human rights violations and subject to unbearable torture and repressive measures
2425017 we are here to support the tibetan freedom movement because korea was invaded by japan we experienced the colonization that is why most koreans know the sufferings of being ruled by force many koreans were killed by japanese same thing same dirty history repeats itself again and again that is why i support the tibetan independence
2425018 i am here to make a contribution for peace and for freedom of the tibetans both inside and outside occupied tibet
2425019 people at that time thought you were limited but we thought we could go beyond what our fathers and mothers did
2425020 one out of three of you guys will be in vietnam in a very short period of time
2425021 as scared as i ever been in my whole life
2425022 if they killed mlk and rfk what are they going to do to me
2425023 it becomes part of our identity part of who we are
2425024 remember you used to sell them for 80 cents to me girl
2425025 the tension was so high and in the midst of the riots you were in a state of disbelief
2425026 but we had our parents there to support us and at that time we took it as a big setback but we knew we had to continue on
2425027 we graduated from high school on june 4 and of course there were parties that night and im sure i had to be in at 12 midnight because i was always told nothing good happened after 12 midnight in my perfect protected little world of course i was furious
2425028 well the next morning i woke up to the blood curdling screams in the den of my dad and brother they had just seen the news that robert kennedy had been assassinated i ran in there and saw my brother sobbing and my dad throwing pillows and i said what in the world and they said robert kennedy is dead it marked the era and it marked me my little innocent protected world turned on a dime
2425029 with protests on college campuses and the race riots the status quo was disappearing and it all was a little bit frightening but with nasa and the thought of man walking on the moon it was this whole new frontier thing
2425030 we thought all the worlds frontiers were used up and with nasa you thought no theyre not
2425031 i got a letter that i had to go to charlotte for an examination before the draft
2425032 when we went back home to greensboro on the bus it was real somber
2425033 something really bizarre is happening in the skies over the uk ive been dealing in sightings for 30 years and we currently have something very real which mankind cannot explain
2425034 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry
2425035 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2425036 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2425037 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2425038 he just couldnt live with the constant pounding from the tabloids
2425039 we feel our reporting and our investigation have been vindicated
2425040 it took so long because edwards was just so bold in lying about it
2425041 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2425042 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2425043 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2425044 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2425045 if they new zealand come here and play the series they would be more than welcome but if they want to skip then it would be their decision we are not desperate for the series
2425046 weve already played around 20 one dayers and will play more in the champions trophy so there is no desperation over the new zealand series
2425047 he was due on the seventh so its almost as if he waited for the exact time to make his appearance hes our first child so obviously he was always going to be special but this has made him unique
2425048 we will make him fully aware of how special he is when he is old enough to understand he was smiling straight away
2425049 he looks a lot like his dad i dont really have any ambitions for what i want him to do when he grows up he can be whoever he wants to be
2425050 theres been a real buzz on the ward we were joking in the morning that maybe one of our new arrivals would be at 8 08am but we never dreamed it would happen it has to be highly unusual that it all fell into place its a real fluke
2425051 the current test is uncomfortable not entirely accurate and difficult for the elderly children and people with disabilities
2425052 past the age of 60 every person has to go for this test every two years before renewing their drivers licence people tire from it quickly and it reports false information on a large number of people who are unable to sit still in the machine
2425053 the vip was appreciated by all of the doctors who wanted to test it for themselves they know the problems with the current visual field test and welcome a new solution
2425054 earlier we had decided to take part in the all party meet and place our viewpoint before them but the very presence of three major
2425055 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia
2425056 two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day
2425057 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2425058 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2425059 this practice is devoid of any ingredients that would render the transactions transparent since the proferring of contracts among staff members and its institutions creates bases for conflicts of interest irregularities fraud and or corruption
2425060 in this case the army had hired three cars from the maid who incidentally was the wife of a senior functionary in its core
2425061 systems would be instituted to discontinue hiring of vehicles which are owned by members of the force
2425062 british growers are supplying 100 of our potatoes now so we need to secure supplies
2425063 but we know there has been massive instability with costs so we have employed an independent firm of business consultants to track all vital costs for potato growers including pesticides fertiliser fuel labour land rents and storage costs especially electricity
2425064 it is worth looking at some fw front covers to get a feel for what works close ups will probably work better for a cover shot than a long distance one
2425065 well also need the original file size to be of a big enough quality so make sure you take the picture on the high quality setting on your camera

2425078 this passage shows how slaves coming form africa preferred to die or down themselves than getting to the
2425079 the slaves that were captured rather have died than suffer through horrible treatment
2425080 this man is a witness of the harsh conditions of slaves on boats traveling through the middle passage who starved and would prefer to die than continue the voyage
2425081 the elements of culture that survive the disruption of slavery is the cultural diffusion and the traditional ways
2425082 some of the enduring elements of african american culture is their traditions
2425083 t he real cause for the abolition of slavery was black and white activism
2425084 the speaker is a japanese shogun who is stating that japanese ships are forbidden to sail to foreign countries or the owner will be put to death
2425085 tokugawa ieyasu is the speaker he states that anybody who leaves in a ship and returns is put to death japanese ships are forbidden meaning nobody may use them they will die if they try
2425086 the speaker must be a shogun explaining the negative consequences of global trade they shoguns feared that global trade would corrupt japan and that the daimyos would form alliances or receive weapons from outside sources
2425087 the speaker is a tokugawa shogun and his point of view is that h e does not want relations with the outside world since it can destroy japan or even be conquered like the philippines
2425088 prejudice in favor of or against one thing person or group compared with another usually in a way considered to be unfair
2425089 the point of view is of a man who witness ed the increase in slave trade in africa
2425090 t he portuguese were very friendly but then the portuguese destroyed them
2425091 it was transformed because the portuguese brought along their religion and their culture with them and they imposed it on them
2425092 the kingdom of kongos contact with the portuguese allowed for contact with the other world which brought in new things and different cultures to the kongo kingdom
2425093 the kingdom of kongo was transformed by its contacts with the portuguese because since they gain ed numerous amounts of goods numerous goods were gained such as weaponry for their kingdom

2425095 i only met my brothers family once the year they invited our family over to share thanksgiving dinner since we were basically a group of strangers looking to make a good first impression the table conversation was nothing more than friendly idle chitchat

2425116 you always hope for a chance to play in a game like this
2425117 when you are in the championship you wonder if there will be a play off final then when i was at reading in the premier league we were hoping for a cup run
2425118 now as i come to the end of my career ive been given the chance to play at wembley which i never thought id get
2425119 it was never on my mind so signing for portsmouth was a lucky break
2425120 we are all looking forward to the game and i want to play a part
2425121 i dont want a player who thinks he should be playing somewhere else
2425122 i want players who are fully committed to getting reading back in the premier league
2425123 alan has heard nothing from everton he knows keegan wants to keep him
2425124 confidence is high because we have great players and it is important for us to carry on winning every match and win more trophies
2425125 we have all the conditions here at this club that we need to improve and win trophies for the club which is important both for the club and ourselves because everyone feels better when we win
2425126 we have the quality and we are expecting trophies this season we have had a good pre season and i look forward to starting for real now
2425127 roy is a player i know very well having tried to get him from cork before his move to sunderland
2425128 in fact he might have been one of my first signings for dundee united had it not been for interest in the player from the premier league i tried to obtain him on loan last season and am absolutely delighted to eventually get him to tannadice
2425129 he is a very direct player with lots of pace and is a natural and proven goalscorer
2425130 although he can play wide right and midfield i see him as a striker and im sure hell be a big success in the spl im also certain that united supporters will enjoy seeing him play for the team
2425131 hell benefit greatly from playing regular first team football at the highest level in scotland and therefore this deal is not only good for dundee united but will also be to the advantage of the player and his club
2425132 all transfer dealings these days particularly those involving a large sums of money do take time
2425133 i never had any doubts the transfer would be completed
2425134 it was hilarious the lads wanted cristiano to know there was no tension after all the transfer talk
2425135 they sorted the shirt out earlier this week and couldnt wait to give it to him when he reported back for duty cristiano took it in very good spirit
2425136 the lads love playing pranks on each other dont forget rio ferdinand even did his own tv show of wind ups and this was up there with the best
2425137 it was the perfect way to put an end to all the speculation about whether ronnie was going or staying
2425138 chelsea have made a formal offer for robinho but i dont know the amount
2425139 robinho is very angry because of the way reals directors are behaving
2425140 he calls me every day to find out if someone has informed me something about his future and i am forced to tell him they are not answering the phone
2425141 i have been trying to talk to a madrid director for three days and they have disappeared
2425142 we have been told of a doping violation found by the greek doping authorities
2425143 this athlete is now not coming to the games as a result of this finding
2425144 i was not in the pre season tournament with the team and its frustrating to stay at the training centre and work alone but it is for a good cause
2425145 i know what i am doing today will allow me to be better tomorrow
2425146 i have always said i am always in chelsea its a great team with great players and a great coach and a president who has ambition
2425147 i do not talk about it i am in chelsea everything goes well there
2425148 i still have two years of my contract if my employers do not want me to leave ill be a chelsea player today they made me understand they want to see me playing again for the team
2425149 the senior police officer came in and asked who is the english guy here and i put my hand up and he said you are free you are out of here and everyone jumped up and cheered and started to clap
2425150 there were 22 in the cell yesterday and we were jam packed but they split us up one half in one cell and one half in the other

2425171 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2425172 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
2425173 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
2425174 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
2425175 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2425176 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2425177 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2425178 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and non lead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
2425179 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased

2425192 well ms customer we did provide you with the terms amp conditions upon opening the account and it clearly states that upon signing the account agreement you give us full and express permission to screw you royally its listed on page 666 and its not a bank error that you dont know latin

2425197 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist
2425198 but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
2425199 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2425200 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2425201 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2425202 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
2425203 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
2425204 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2425205 those books have created a subliminal language and i think judgments will be made unconsciously about barack obama
2425206 na ve cynicism in election 2008 dispositionism v situationism your brain on politics
2425207 hiiii i havent heard from you in a while just thinking about you i miss you and yada yada yada
2425208 either way i knew he was wrestling with his feelings
2425209 the theme of the convention was based on 2 peter 1 4 he has given us his very great and precious promises that through them you may partake in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world
2425210 but 350 came the organizers were under sweat as they made arrangements for this unexpected number
2425211 everyone in the convention expressed their desire to have this kind of event once or twice a year
2425212 we are so happy that god protected us we are rejoicing here with the lord but pray for our bodies we were beaten quite badly please pray that we would receive healing
2425213 how they are must live to lay hands on money for life
2425214 at times ill be bored at times ill be tired at all times though ill be happy
2425215 of course i dreamed of becoming an olympic volunteer i have a little brother back home who wishes he was me i want to make him proud
2425216 there are 1 3 billion people in china and only half a million volunteers
2425217 its our job to give out of towners directions to help sick and disabled people were taking this seriously
2425218 think of the government as a circle think of the foreign guests as a circle the government and the foreign guests overlap only slightly in the middle of our circle
2425219 what appears to be the chinese way is not to empower the front line employees
2425220 i was so excited i felt the same as everyone else proud of my country and ready to volunteer
2425221 there was an event for volunteers to sign a pledge i didnt go thats when my school got involved
2425222 i gave up my spot at an academic competition in seoul to volunteer
2425223 i sort of regret it on the other hand after what china has gone through this year i couldnt abandon my country
2425224 im doing this for my country not for the world
2425225 i visited switzerland and someone asked me if all chinese still ride horses and wear robes so you see i cant wait for the olympics
2425226 look all thats happening and there are experienced people on the campaign side coming into the system very quickly
2425227 for example tony nutt former prime minister john howards campaign adviser will play a supporting role and there are others from here and around australia chipping in
2425228 thats part of the opportunistic way hes gone about it
2425229 but well pull our campaign into order very very quickly and we start that today by announcing our shadows and spokespersons
2425230 its wrong if labor is trying to suggest the liberal party doesnt have policies
2425231 theres been a lot of work done on policies across all the various portfolios
2425232 i think what well see in a short campaign is that well have to concentrate on the key policy issues and the points of difference
2425233 law and order will be right up there as number one education and health and we will go into other areas as well
2425234 were not just going to confine it to that and also the long term future for western australia
2425235 almost they switch off so we will try to make a point of highlighting the differences between liberal and labor
2425236 and now with the internet we will put the more detailed material on the website
2425237 i respect the decision of the people in the referendum
2425238 im not about to simply ignore the will of the people even though i think the referendum was a mistake to have gone down that path my general view to deregulation of any industry is that it should be done carefully over time in a series of discreet steps
2425239 there might be special cases for special classes but basically well be dealing with weekday or weeknight trading
2425240 weve got four ministers carpenter ripper mactiernan and logan falling over themselves in confusion over our major industry mining and theres a 17 000 backlog of approvals for mining tenements
2425241 and you can go on alannah mac tiernan what are we doing having the transport agency releasing confidential information about people in wa david templeman lead poisoning in esperance the parlous state of aboriginal kids in wa the drop off in kids attending government schools
2425242 this has been a poor government and essentially dishonest even the calling of this election when alan carpenter and jim mcginty literally the day before are demanding we come back to parliament to deal quickly with truth in sentencing legislation where is the honesty and integrity in that
2425243 aww i dont know about a slogan ill emphasise honest government and integrity throughout the campaign
2425244 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2425245 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2425246 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2425247 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2425248 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2425249 those who take the first step and sign up for individual welfare reform would then be provided with the four other steps of opportunity by government and the private sector
2425250 it was the largest rain dispersal operation in china and the first time that such technology has been used to ensure the weather conditions for the olympic opening
2425251 nuestros pacificadores y las unidades que les apoyan est n realizando en estos momentos una operaci n para imponer la paz a la parte georgiana
2425252 which is giving me flashbacks in our case i dont have to worry much about this in particular and the advisors are good enough to let me know that i might

2425254 nach einem weiteren frustrierenden wochenende f r red bull in ungarn sind wir hinter renault auf platz sechs in der konstrukteursweltmeisterschaft gerutscht und haben den anschluss an toyota verloren das ist nicht gut aber auch nicht das ende der welt die ausgeglichenheit der kr fteverh ltnisse im mittelfeld l sst ein team im saisonverlauf nach oben schwingen
2425255 in den verbleibenden sieben rennen kann sich noch viel ndern
2425256 andererseits m ssen wir auch die tatsache erkennen dass wir in den vergangenen beiden rennen keine punkte gewonnen haben das l sst die vermutung zu dass unsere gegenw rtige pace im vergleich zu vor einem monat oder so abgefallen ist
2425257 unsere performance hat sich vielleicht um ein halbes prozent verschoben im endeffekt sind wir stehen geblieben w hrend alle teams um uns herum einen schritt nach vorne gemacht haben im gegensatz dazu waren wir im fr hen saisonverlauf diejenigen die sich vorw rts bewegt haben
2425258 aber so ist eben die formel 1 sie ist ein sich st ndig bewegendes ziel und wir m ssen stets zur stelle sein
2425259 wir m ssen einfach versuchen zu verstehen warum wir dieses bruchst ckchen an relativer pace verloren haben und wieder auf den fruchtbareren entwicklungspfad zur ckkehren den wir noch vor ein paar wochen eingeschlagen hatten alle teams m ssen ihre ressourcen zwischen 2008 und 2009 aufteilen aber in unserem fall geht die entwicklung des rb4 genauso eilig weiter nachdem unser ziel noch immer in platz vier der konstrukteure besteht
2425260 lacys superb access allows for rich observations of the human dynamics behind the tech wall of silicon valley much of what she relates would be familiar to people with valley experience but its illuminating for the general reader
2425261 some of the reporting is impressive in its sheer detail lacy obviously spent a great deal of time with these celebrated entrepreneurs her explanation of how venture capital works is instructive and clear perhaps one of the best yet written for a general readership
2425262 all of lacys perceptiveness and explanatory prowess doesnt obscure the fact that the organizing principle of her book is inconsistent lacy also profiles facebook wunderkind mark zuckerberg who was too young to be lucky in the late 1990s his first opportunity is right now and so far hes proving lucky and good at once therefore lacys selective presentation of the web 2 0 landscape given a subtitle that intimates a much broader exploration is the most troubling aspect of the book
2425263 we have reviewed the coordinate reference system used by microsoft google etc and believe that it is technically flawed we will not devalue the epsg dataset by including such inappropriate geodesy and cartography
2425264 along with his commitment to clean air and water and to conserving open space he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore by addressing this problem responsibly john mccain believes we can meet our obligation to be proper caretakers of creation in a manner of which we can be proud by protecting our country strengthening our economy and addressing the challenges of our time rather than leaving a much worse problem for our children

2425273 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
2425274 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
2425275 the commercial was produced by a local automobile distributor based on its own judgment and nissan motor has nothing to do with the commercial
2425276 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
2425277 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day

2425282 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam even though a host of independent nonpartisan organizations have said this attack isnt true senator mccain continues to lie about senator obamas plan to give 95 of all families a tax cut of 1 000 and not raise taxes for those making under 250 000 a single dime the reason so many families are hurting today is because weve had eight years of failed bush policies that senator mccain wants to continue for another four and thats what barack obama will change as president

2425291 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2425309 ze waren niet op zoek naar mij maar naar een andere bewoner die niet aanwezig was deze heeft zich later gemeld en zat korte tijd vast
2425310 ik heb nog met de politie staan praten maar ze waren helemaal niet in mij ge nteresseerd ik heb er ook nooit iets van gemerkt dat de politie mij als een verdachte zou hebben gezien

2425312 we lost by 28 points in the first game against puerto rico in 2004 and it did more than just get your attention it blew us all away
2425313 it was like a big red light out there flashing
2425314 hes the only gold medalist on our team hes someone our young players look up to and because of his experience and leadership we felt he had a role
2425315 i just try to share my experience of 2000 because we havent had the success weve wanted the last couple of years
2425316 the worlds gotten better at the game of basketball we all understand that so were ready for the challenge
2425317 you can put the best players together but we all understand that we dont need kobe to score 30 we dont need lebron to score 30 we just need to be a team and play for that extra pass and when you look at the point guard situation in chris and deron we have that leadership that we didnt have in 04
2425318 basically weve destroyed medecos key control because we can make plastic keys for any of their m3 locks and a lot of their biaxial locks which is their last generation of locks
2425319 vor der em gingen die berlegungen eindeutig in die richtung dass ich aufh re da deutete alles darauf hin dass ich sicher und endg ltig aufh ren werde habe ich aber nie gesagt
2425320 nat rlich wollte ich nicht mit einem derartigen misserfolg aufh ren das war sicher ein argument
2425321 wenn eine weitere reduktion auf 15 erfolgt wird man fragen m ssen inwieweit das mit den milit rtaktischen berlegungen bereinstimmt
2425322 kapfenberg ist eine kampfstarke mannschaft und hat gegen austria wien und salzburg zu hause zwei unentschieden erk mpft
2425323 wir sind jedenfalls gut auf den gegner eingestellt und wollen drei punkte
2425324 das spielt keine rolle sturm ist k rperlich super drauf
2425325 wir haben gewusst dass es am anfang so sein wird aber ein dreier w re f r uns ganz wichtig auch wenn diese hoffnung gegen sturm etwas vermessen klingt
2425326 wir wollen drei punkte holen egal ob der gegner kapfenberg oder rapid hei t
2425327 ein spiel gegen rapid ist immer etwas besonderes da braucht es eigentlich keine extra motivation
2425328 mir w re es lieber gewesen sie w ren weitergekommen
2425329 wir m ssen uns konzentrieren so weh das auch tut man muss das verdr ngen
2425330 die ausgangslage ist ganz anders es geht um meisterschaftspunkte und wir wollen ganz normal punkten
2425331 wir wissen dass es sehr schwer wird sie sind mit dem publikum im r cken aggressiver und gef hrlicher als ausw rts aber wir haben im heimspiel gegen famagusta eine tolle leistung gezeigt und wenn der einsatz und die laufbereitschaft stimmen dann bin ich optimistisch
2425332 er ist zu mir gekommen und wir haben gesprochen ich glaube auch nicht dass seine stellung innerhalb der mannschaft angekratzt ist die sache trifft ihn genauso hart es w re der gr te fehler jetzt das zu tun was alle erwarten
2425333 wir m ssen gegen mattersburg unbedingt etwas ernten eine schwache leistung wie gegen sturm ist dem publikum nicht mehr zuzumuten
2425334 dass wir nur einmal zu hause so schlecht spielen k nnen
2425335 der krisenstab ist unvermindert intensiv darum bem ht die beiden verschleppten wieder in sichere deutsche obhut zu bringen
2425336 ich glaube er wird es in den n chsten stunden unterschreiben
2425337 it has been observed that some of the sections dealing with creation of local government and boundary adjustment in our constitution for example have been noted to be impossible to implement
2425338 your excellencies and very distinguished participants ladies and gentlemen at the inception of this administration in may 2007 mr president informed all nigerians of the desire of government to review a variety of laws that have not helped our country to develop as we wish
2425339 prominent among these laws were the land use act let me use this opportunity to reaffirm the administrations commitment towards amending or repealing all such laws that are not in sync with our aspiration for a society governed by the rule of law and respect dignity
2425340 the whole essence of the constitution review is money after the constituioon is amended we have to insist and get other people to accept that derivation is an obligation and not an option
2425341 the worst problem we have is the oil and gas law which does not protect our crops and land making the region the worst in terms of development
2425342 why should we be dependent when we should be independent why should we go to abuja to share allocation when the resources are here if not for god we would not be alive today no light no water and no proper accommodation this is a situation in which one would wish to be dead than live this way
2425343 these boys require force because they are not ideological i will bring resources to back the agitation if it is ideological i have said it before unless the law is enforced things would not change the problem is that we have lost value orientation these boys cannot work because they get more money from criminal activities

2425345 je ne compte pas partir dici avant d tre r gularis
2425346 what the hell good is forgiveness from god if nobody wants to treat you like youve been forgiven
2425347 when i turn on the faucet of confession it needs to flow fast and constant otherwise if i have to put my arm up the faucet and extract the truth one drop at a time it will be miserable for us both
2425348 the lords servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone able to teach patiently enduring evil correcting his opponents with gentleness god may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth
2425349 why are we the only family who doesnt play video games whenever we want to all my other friends can play whenever they want to
2425350 since you have heard about christ and have learned the truth that is in jesus throw off your old evil nature and your former way of life which is rotten through and through full of lust and deception instead there must be a spiritual renewal of your thoughts and attitudes you must display a new nature because you are a new person created in gods likeness righteous holy and true
2425351 sin by letting anger gain control over you dont let the sun go down while you are still angry for anger gives a might foothold to the devil
2425352 since god chose you to be the holy people whom he loves you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy kindness humility gentleness and patience you must make allowance for each others faults and forgive the person who offends you and the most important piece of clothing you must wear is love love is what binds us all together in perfect harmony
2425353 never pay back evil for evil to anyone dear friends never avenge yourselves leave that to god for it is written i will take vengeance i will repay those who deserve it says the lord instead do what the scriptures say if your enemies are hungry feed them if they are thirsty give them something to drink and they will be ashamed of what they have done to you dont let evil get the best of you but conquer evil by doing good
2425354 dad as the sad sounding music played when s man died it showed me how useless it is to keep trying to kill bad guys cause you always end up getting killed yourself
2425355 we didnt do anything to get saved god saved us apart from anything i did are you nuts
2425356 believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved
2425357 stop doing what you are doing now stop thinking the way you are thinking now and start doing what jesus tells you to do start thinking the way god tells you to
2425358 becoming a believer became synonymous with making a decision and proving that decision by taking physical action it is important to note that this system is entirely foreign to the scriptures
2425359 synomyous with making a decision and proving that decision by taking a physical action
2425360 how the gospel applies to christians refusal to take communion
2425361 i submit that it is possible one may actually be committing a sin that was just as heinous as the corinthian matter when one does not partake of communion because of guilt and sin
2425362 it is not easy to preach the truth that we are saved by the grace of christ alone and that is through the vicarious humanity of jesus and in its substitutionary bearing upon faith that we can properly believe but this is what may be proclaimed at the holy communion as nowhere else
2425363 i have found in my own ministry that it is easiest to preach the unconditional nature of grace and the vicarious humanity and substitutionary role of christ in faith at the celebration of the eucharist where the call for repentance and faith is followed by communion in the body and blood of christ in which we stretch out empty hands to receive the bread and wine nothing in my hands i bring simply to the cross i cling
2425364 there at the holy table i know that i cannot rely on my own faith but only on the vicarious faith of the lord jesus in the total substitution of his atoning sacrifice on the cross
2425365 i believe this emphasis in the mission of the church may well be more important than anything else today there is a kind of subtle pelagianism in preaching and teaching that has the effect of throwing people back in the last resort on their own act of faith so that in the last analysis responsibility is taken off the shoulders of the lamb of god and put upon the shoulders of the poor sinners and we know well in our hearts that we cannot cope with it is that not one of the things that keeps pushing people away from the church i think here the reluctance of many people to approach the holy table which happens on communion sundays when people fail to understand the absolutely free and unconditional nature of the grace of the lord jesus christ he came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance through the miracle of his cross he turns our sins and failings into the very means he uses in order to save us and bind us to himself that is precisely what he pledges to us in the communion of his body and blood
2425366 i need to do such and such to get back right with god
2425367 thank you god that ive been obedient enough to partake of communion this time
2425368 tattle tale tattle tale hang your britches on a nail hang em high hang em low hang em on the picture show
2425369 he who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets but he who is trustworthy conceals a matter
2425370 whoever goes around as a gossip tells secrets do not associate with a person whose mouth is always open
2425371 gossip is telling something to someone else when neither of you are part of the problem or the solution
2425372 the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly
2425373 we dont need no education teachers leave us kids alone
2425374 all i know is the way i feel and if its real im gonna keep it alive
2425375 it is only by beelzebul the prince of demons that this man casts out demons
2425376 every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and if satan casts out satan he is divided against himself and if i cast out demons by beelzebub by whom do your sons cast them out but if it is by the spirit of god that i cast out demons then the kingdom of god has come upon you
2425377 no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit
2425378 took him and explained to him the way of god more accurately
2425379 he had been instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in spirit he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning jesus though he knew only of the baptism of john
2425380 when he was at table with them he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they recognized him
2425381 thats what the holy spirit did in the bible he doesnt do that anymore today
2425382 there is power in pain how authority is earned through the cross
2425383 forgiveness is the fragrance of the violet which still clings fast to the heel that crushed it
2425384 vision starts with identity and purpose through a revolution in our identity we can think with divine purpose such a change begins with a revelation of him
2425385 his promises for the church are beyond all comprehension too many consider
2425386 the latter glory of this house will be greater than the former
2425387 the christian life is not found on the cross it is found because of the cross
2425388 if anyone desires to come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me
2425389 as the father sent me even so i send you
2425390 can we sit at your right hand and at your left hand when you come into your kingdom
2425391 can you drink the cup i am about to drink
2425392 father forgive them for they know not what they do
2425393 for the son of man also came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many
2425394 you do not know what kind of spirit you are of for the son of man did not come to destroy mens lives but to save them
2425395 and having disarmed the powers and authorities he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross
2425396 really know christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead
2425397 i can learn what it means to suffer with him sharing in his death so that somehow i can experience the resurrection from the dead
2425398 i am glad when i suffer for you in my body for i am completing what remains of christs sufferings for his body the church
2425399 for you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in christ but also the privilege of suffering for him
2425400 god made me for china but he also made me fast and when i run i feel his pleasure
2425401 how to deal with the guilt of sexual failure for the glory of christ and his global cause
2425402 follow the link to the sermon manuscript or to listen to the sermon
2425403 man had originally been made perfect he had then in adam broken the covenant that god had made with him rom 5 12 he was now a covenant breaker and as such subject to the wrath of god
2425404 but how could paul expect that covenant breakers should become covenant keepers
2425405 while the apostle paul was at corinth the lord spoke to him in the night by a vision and the lord said to paul one night in a vision
2425406 to be created in gods image is therefore to have a particular point of comparison not to oneself but to god and a distinct command not simply to reproduce but to exercise dominion
2425407 although they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks to him but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts were darkened
2425408 they exchanged the truth about god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever
2425409 he is also the new chairman of the southern baptist conventions executive committee this is harrells second tour of duty on the exec com having been one of the first movement conservatives appointed to that powerful body in the early days of the conservative resurgence
2425410 we have two important issues to solve in our convention
2425411 i think the problem of calvinism in the sbc could be solved if we establish one ground rule if a man wants to start a calvinistic church let him have at it if a man wants to answer a call to a calvinistic church he should have the freedom to do that but that man should not answer a call to a church that is not calvinistic neglect to tell them his leanings and then surreptitiously lead them to become a calvinistic church that is not to suggest that all of our calvinistic friends do that but when it is done it is divisive and hurtful
2425412 let your conversation be gracious and attractive so that you will have the right response for everyone
2425413 again i say dont get involved in foolish ignorant arguments that only start fights a servant of the lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone be able to teach and be patient with difficult people gently instruct those who oppose the truth perhaps god will change those peoples hearts and they will learn the truth then they will come to their senses and escape from the devils trap for they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants
2425414 therefore i a prisoner for serving the lord beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling for you have been called by god always be humble and gentle be patient with each other making allowance for each others faults because of your love make every effort to keep yourselves united in the spirit binding yourselves together with peace
2425415 you were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters love each other deeply with all your heart
2425416 if you were watching someone torture your little brothers or sister would you want someone to pay to watch it and laugh at it and then walk away commenting to a newspaper that they enjoyed it
2425417 remember what happened remember what you saw that day is that stuff real should we make movies about it then and give the glory back to the devil in producing movies that show his pathetic and defeated power terrorizing and torturing the image of god
2425418 why would you expect me to put money into a company that is supposed to center around online advertising when their own site has insert any of the issues above here
2425419 what benefit do i get from the programme itself so that i can offer it to other people
2425420 i know some of you have sent suggestions that have gone unanswered

2425425 we are asking the public to help bring these offenders to justice
2425426 his wife was still able to make a claim on these assets because she was still married to him and they had never done a legal property settlement
2425427 even if the debts are in only one name if they are there to support the family such as a personal loan to buy a car or furniture then its a shared debt
2425428 calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation of tibet
2425429 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2425430 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2425431 the chinese government will not be allowed to use the olympics to hide the reality of its harsh rule inside tibet

2425460 i have negotiated with the dang wangi police to stop the forum at 9 30am or else we will act
2425461 some protesters just dont understand it not everyone who attended the forum is against islam
2425462 some just participated to voice out their views in defending the position of islam in the country
2425463 this forum is about islam they want indians to be muslims and then muslims to be indians
2425464 they have organised similar forums before on malay rights and if we dont stop them today they will do it again in the future
2425465 one of the critical factors of maintenance being performed is the number of licensed engineers and in australia that ratio is approximately one to one or two to one

2425469 i had said that i would participate in the debate if that is the only way to find out the truth and those responsible for these land scams
2425470 i do not see the relevance of koh accusing me of being afraid when all i want is to get to the bottom of the land scam that has seriously affected our states finances and development plans
2425471 since our argument is about the land scam we should stick to the topic im willing to debate on other issues but it should be in another forum or debate at the moment let us focus on the land scam issue
2425472 how can i retract my statements about the land scam even before the debate and the land scam is a fact that i will never retract when even the former deputy chief minister datuk seri dr hilmi yahaya admitted that the previous government had made a mistake which hilmi accepted full responsibility
2425473 if we allow the concert to proceed it will be an insult to our freedom fighters

2425478 hasanuddin is a very close family friend and he allowed me the use of the apartment for my political meetings
2425479 several of them have been questioned by the police including hasanuddin and the police know we can account for our meetings there
2425480 at a time when the government is running scared about crossovers how can we hold meetings in public
2425481 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2425482 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
2425483 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
2425484 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
2425485 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
2425486 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum
2425487 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2425488 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2425489 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2425490 non credo siano molto verosimili queste cifre gi mi sembra molto difficile che si realizzi una qualunque crescita
2425491 chiaro che questo un momento di grande debolezza come indicato dalle survey coerenti con una crescita piatta nella migliore delle ipotesi
2425492 loutlook quindi generalmente negativo vediamo un secondo semestre piatto ma a questo punto i rischi sono al ribasso anche perch gli indicatori di luglio continuano a segnalare debolezza e non ci sono miglioramenti in vista
2425493 questo dato negativo apre le porte ad una situazione di recessione tecnica
2425494 se il dato fosse stato negativo dello 0 1 la mia previsione per il 2008 sarebbe stata dello 0 2 ma a questo punto sicuramente peggiore e non vedo aperture per una ripresa a breve tempo
2425495 a questo punto si potr senzaltro parlare di recessione per lo meno secondo la definizione tecnica di due trimestri consecutivi di contrazione del prodotto interno lordo per il terzo trimestre abbiamo infatti unattesa di una caduta di 0 1 dellattivit economica mentre inserendo la stima istat di oggi nel modello statistico per la media danno il risultato di un davvero modesto 0 1 a rischio concreto di crescita zero
2425496 la fiacchezza italiana coerente con una debolezza europea ma litalia risente di pi di problemi strutturali di rigidit di una maggiore sensibilit alleuro forte per la natura delle esportazioni
2425497 questi aspetti strutturali comunque enfatizzano gli effetti di uno shock comune che leuropa sta subendo
2425498 variabile chiave per lattivit economica uem resta comunque la germania con un risultato che sappiamo sar negativo ma contrassegnato da elevata volatilit
2425499 in qualche modo definisce il tono per il resto della zona euro rendendo probabile che avremo una contrazione nellintera area

2425507 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2425508 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2425509 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2425510 clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination seems to be no more effective than expectant management in couples with unexplained fertility
2425511 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
2425512 the data does not show that theres any difference between the drug and no treatment and iui and no treatment
2425513 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2425514 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2425515 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2425516 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2425517 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2425518 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2425519 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2425520 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2425521 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2425522 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2425523 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2425524 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2425525 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2425526 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2425527 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2425528 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2425529 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2425530 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2425531 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2425532 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2425533 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2425534 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2425535 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2425536 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2425542 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2425545 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2425546 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2425547 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2425548 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2425549 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2425550 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2425551 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2425552 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2425553 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2425554 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2425555 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2425556 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2425557 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2425558 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2425559 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2425560 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2425561 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2425562 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

2425569 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2425570 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2425571 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2425572 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2425573 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2425574 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2425575 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2425576 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2425577 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2425578 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2425579 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2425580 disgusted i guess that would be the way i feel about the way i played
2425581 but a couple of times he tried to make a play out of a tough situation
2425582 without question the game is not too big for j t osullivan
2425583 yeah if it got called but its not my call
2425584 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2425585 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2425586 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2425587 i thought they ran the ball well and it was good for our first day
2425588 we missed a couple of passes that we would have liked to get but we have a lot more games to go
2425589 overall i thought the tempo in the run game with all our running backs was good and the offensive line did a good job up front
2425590 his ability to jump cut stop and start thats something you cant see in practice
2425591 when i got into the game i was halfway in tears because i havent been out there in so long
2425592 just to get another opportunity to play again i was happy and nervous all at once
2425593 coach told me they werent going to play me long but i didnt know how much run i was going to get in a short time
2425594 after i went out there and got the first hit out of the way my nerves settled down a whole lot

2425597 well its no wonder that edward and bella got their happily ever after
2425598 everyone in california thought the lighthouse was built at yerba buena and everyone on cape cod thought it was destroyed
2425599 the facts kind of got lost in history its just one of those things knowing the federal government and the lighthouse bureau they were pretty frugal institutions and im guessing they saved the lighthouse because they knew theyd find use for it again somewhere

2425666 a ripping piece of reporting that shows how subprime mortgage lending rose amid the ruins of the savings and loan crisis
2425667 the authors also tell the story of angelo mozilo whose father was a butcher of italian descent mr mozilo outsmarted and outhustled countless rivals to make countrywide the no 1 mortgage lender only to be done in by his own hubris grasping for even more market share just when mortgages were turning toxic
2425668 the authors reveal in gory detail just what went wrong at countrywide and how so many chuckleheads made so many bone headed decisions
2425669 les dirigeants g orgiens ont recouru des actions tr s agressives en oss tie du sud

2425671 no hay ninguna evidencia cient fica en el mundo entero de que este tratamiento con levonorgestrel sea abortivo salvo en ratas y conejas
2425672 vamos a apelar la semana pr xima es un fallo sin fundamentos cient ficos y adem s incongruente
2425673 no se describe en la literatura caso alguno de interrupci n de un embarazo ya iniciado como resultado en dosis y r gimen correcto de administraci n de la ae con levonorgestrel
2425674 aconsejada en los programas de la organizaci n mundial de la salud como m todo anticonceptivo de emergencia
2425675 nos ha permitido entre otras cosas con el programa de salud sexual y reproductiva ser exitosos en la prevenci n de la mortalidad materna
2425676 no es abortiva eso est fuera de discusi n hasta que la sentencia est firme la p ldora se seguir distribuyendo

2425678 las solidaridades corporativas con acusados de terrorismo de estado perturban el proceso de reconciliaci n de las fuerzas armadas con la sociedad
2425679 no tiene responsabilidad alguna en la administraci n custodia y alojamiento del personal militar detenido
2425680 por sus responsabilidades en el ejercicio del comando de su gran unidad de batalla en las circunstancias vinculadas con la fuga
2425681 no hay que confundir a un pibe con un narco
2425682 por qu porque los narcotraficantes han hecho lo que han querido nunca hubo informaci n inteligente y los narcos traficaban lo que quer an a europa fundamentalmente han desviado precursores qu micos o sustancias de corte como realmente corresponder a llamarlos y nadie se ha dado cuenta el caso de los mexicanos que fabricaban metanfetamina para venderla en estados unidos es buen un ejemplo
2425683 hay que aleccionar humillar y agraviar al consumidor de todas las formas posibles porque es el que viene a ensuciar la sociedad que nosotros construimos y que queremos mantener en esas condiciones
2425684 no es liberar la circulaci n de las drogas sino apartar a consumidores y adictos del sistema jur dico y carcelario
2425685 se le secuestrar lo que tiene pero no ser esposado
2425686 qu le parece la propuesta del gobierno de despenalizar la tenencia de drogas para consumo personal
2425687 esa pregunta es mala y yo lo puedo demostrar ahora mire esto
2425688 usted cree que tienen que ir presos los adictos y consumidores de drogas o sustancias ilegales
2425689 pero siguen diciendo que consumo y tenencia son lo mismo por eso es importante que tengamos cuidado cuando mencionamos la despenalizaci n no juguemos en contra de nosotros mismos muchos no entienden la pregunta y eso es lo malo no contamos bien la historia
2425690 personalmente no estoy de acuerdo en despenalizar el consumo de drogas hasta que el pa s no ofrezca garant as que tienen que ver con la cultura y la educaci n hay que buscar la contenci n de quienes son adictos para que sean parte de la comunidad y no victimizarlos
2425691 si va a ser tremendamente engorroso la gente se negar y aparecer n trampas para eludir la norma
2425692 consideramos imperioso identificar el celular con la persona del propietario destac no puede haber celulares flotando o que se vendan en cualquier lugar y hay que evitar que aparatos robados o perdidos puedan ser modificados para usos indebidos
2425693 en secuestros extorsivos secuestros virtuales o acciones delictivas en casas siempre participa un celular
2425694 los que ya son usuarios de celulares con tarjeta deber n inscribirse en el registro oficial agreg el ministro para ello tienen un plazo de 180 d as con posibilidad de una pr rroga por otros seis meses
2425695 si el celular se pierde o se roba ese tel fono se muere ya no se puede rehabilitar de modo que sea imposible usarlo para una acci n delictiva
2425696 es correcto el criterio de aplicar una visi n de mercado un problema de la pol tica criminal en la argentina es desestimar que la mayor a de los delitos est n vinculados con mercados delictuales esto vale tambi n para delitos de poca monta o de subsistencia el que roba cables o garrafas o relojes o celulares lo hace porque hay un mercado organizado para cada uno de esos productos si no se desarticula el mercado es in til perseguir cantidades de gente
2425697 no s si se podr a pensar alguna otra medida de implementaci n menos engorrosa y convendr a tambi n propiciar que las empresas adopten pol ticas de custodia de los equipos que venden
2425698 la sustentabilidad de los fundamentos de la econom a argentina no est en duda y no hay elementos que justifiquen movimientos especulativos en los mercados
2425699 la posibilidad de que las calificadoras le bajen la nota al pa s es una llamada de alerta el gobierno tiene que hacer lo que dijo el jefe de gabinete sergio massa recuperar la confiabilidad en el indec si llega a realizar los cambios necesarios los bonos suben r pidamente
2425700 se est instalando entre algunos extranjeros que argentina est al borde del default el financiamiento para 2008 est cubierto se va a pagar sin problemas lo que se preguntan es c mo va a conseguir la plata para hacer frente a los vencimientos del 2009
2425701 no s lo se mantienen s lidos los super vits gemelos sino que los indicadores de sustentabilidad de la deuda siguen mejorando
2425702 el tipo de cambio est controlado y las reservas permanecen en un nivel elevado pese a las turbulencias financieras externas
2425703 agradezco a los m dicos tucumanos que permitieron mi sobrevivencia
2425704 no eran j venes idealistas sino mercenarios y traidores a la patria
2425705 los ide logos de la subversi n hoy son gobierno
2425706 las patolog as coronarias y respiratorias que l tiene deben evaluarse en el momento del juicio por el estr s que implica
2425707 las debilidades que tiene en el plano mental y el da o neuronal que podr a ser el comienzo de una demencia senil
2425708 en tucum n mantuve y respet la vigencia de las instituciones jur dicas llamadas a ser reemplazadas por asambleas populares seg n el ideario mercenario de la subversi n
2425709 la figura del desaparecido es un arbitrio del accionar psicol gico de la subversi n para disimular sus bajas de combate y encubrir el reclutamiento voluntario o compulsivo de individuos comprometidos con la causa revolucionaria a esto se le llam pasaje a la clandestinidad
2425710 el propio firmenich declar que habr a alg n desaparecido que no ten a nada que ver pero la inmensa mayor a eran militantes no traigo aqu las declaraciones de hebe de bonafini porque me causan verg enza eduardo luis duhalde el secretario de derechos humanos fundador del erp arm las causas

2425712 a las que s lo les faltaba poner d a y hora
2425713 lo liberaron porque yo inform que era un perejil un buch n que hab a colaborado eficientemente
2425714 siguen teniendo el mismo prop sito de usurpar el poder para cambiar nuestro estilo de vida
2425715 well ask judge burnett miller to take action with respect to her suspended sentence for not paying her restitution
2425716 i credit the neighbor for his good description and the composite artist
2425717 its a way to be as transparent as possible to provide the public with clear updates on a complicated process
2425718 but what good is it if you cant read it
2425719 their intent is 100 percent but they should have pushed it harder there has to be a better format they need to take that extra step and make sure people can read it
2425720 los hermanos vivieron aqu durante a os mucho antes de la invasi n militar del 37
2425721 la represi n y despojo de 1937 que dio origen a esta situaci n tiene v ctimas y victimarios y a n sigue impune
2425722 s lo nos quedaron algunas chapas y cueros de animales con eso pasamos el invierno yo ten a 20 a os y fue tr gico ver a mis abuelos llorando despojados del trabajo de generaciones
2425723 la constituci n nacional y el convenio 169 de la oit nos reconocen como leg timos poseedores parques nacionales no tiene competencia legal para ceder ni un metro de su supuesta tierra y el ej rcito no cuenta con t tulo de propiedad por lo cual no tiene sustento el juicio que nos inici por usurpadores por todo esto el estado est violando nuestros derechos m s b sicos
2425724 nada de eso se cumpli funcion como un kiosco inmobiliario entregando concesiones de manera arbitraria a los amigos del poder ofreciendo territorio ancestral al mejor postor
2425725 hab a cuerpos de mujeres ancianos y ni os en las calles
2425726 no se equivoquen esto ya es una guerra una guerra muy real y penosa
2425727 he vivido ah durante todos los conflictos previos incluyendo la guerra a comienzos de la d cada de 1990 y siempre fueron peleados por soldados contra otros soldados
2425728 la diferencia ahora es que la agresi n la sufre la poblaci n civil la gente com n no sabe d nde esconderse o hacia d nde correr o decir que tres personas hab an muerto por disparos de francotiradores mientras trataban de recuperar de la calle los cuerpos muertos de amigos y parientes
2425729 afortunadamente tenemos un pa s que no quiere ser monocultivo
2425730 este es un pa s que quiere agregar valor a sus productos y dar trabajo son la industria y la agroindustria los dos pilares b sicos con los cuales los argentinos podemos volver a generar riqueza trabajo y futuro
2425731 por la diversidad climatol gica de nuestro pa s podemos permitirnos tener una diversidad de producci n agr cola y s que nuestro secretario de agricultura tiene la idea de ir provincia por provincia solucionando los problemas
2425732 esa es la idea ir provincia por provincia porque esto exige una mirada diferente en cada lugar
2425733 el gobierno ha tomado la iniciativa nuevamente estamos en carrera y bien
2425734 si uno analiza la estructura de los mercados llega a la conclusi n de que se arm todo para que la comisi n no tuviera capacidad operativa para que s lo sea un muro de los lamentos
2425735 in trying to retrieve the float he may have gotten into water that was over his head
2425736 i dont think that any of the adults saw it occur
2425737 to my knowledge they performed their duties in an effective manner
2425738 at this point we are continuing to operate as we normally do

2425745 me parece que los empresarios en la argentina tienen que tener mayor responsabilidad porque todos sabemos que el gobierno no es el nico responsable de los incrementos de precios tema en el cual los empresarios s tienen una enorme responsabilidad
2425746 a los empresarios que quieren acusar al gobierno del corrimiento de los precios habr a que preguntarles cu l es el aumento que ellos pusieron sobre cada uno de los productos que fabrican
2425747 muchas veces la argentina tuvo gobiernos que no fueron capaces de sostener instrumentos como el super vit fiscal una balanza comercial favorable desendeudamiento y niveles de reservas que permitan darle previsibilidad a la econom a

2425789 en 1781 enfrentamos a los colonialistas en 2003 enfrentamos a los vendepatria y los derrotamos pero parece que no ha sido suficiente esa derrota ni ha sido suficientemente grande la victoria del 2005 por eso la derecha ha intentado nuevamente reagruparse y camufladamente ha intentado recuperar fuerzas

2425799 the army treats the shooting at point blank range of a bound man only as inappropriate behaviour it disgraces the values which it pretends to uphold
2425800 this case proves once again that the military judicial system views harming innocent citizens as a public image problem and not as a moral issue
2425801 on a daily basis against palestinian kids who throw stones
2425802 of course they dont get that but they are frequently jailed for months
2425803 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2425804 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2425805 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2425806 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2425807 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2425808 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2425809 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2425810 where i wanna spend the rest of my life with someone
2425811 sy het ges sys jammer sy kan my nie help nie sy moet tjaila want sy gaan haar bus mis
2425812 i couldnt help but hear that it had something to do with your ex wife and your daughter run it down to me i think i can help
2425813 and her current husbands too ill take care of it for you
2425814 at present you own one of the best sports books in dallas but you used to run with a bunch of really bad ass southern hijackers the newspapers called the dixie mafia you were the main suspect in three contract murders all hoodlums each one was done in with a single 22 caliber hollow point bullet in the center of the forehead then i recalled that at least a dozen random individuals have been killed in exactly the same way in the last five years here in dallas all were bureaucrats and minor government functionaries and all of whom had one thing in common besides the way they were killed know what that was
2425815 according to the police they all were known for being rude and high handed with the public
2425816 dont misunderstand mr maccord i dont want to rat you out or blackmail you hell im in your debt

2425819 it was a little disconcerting to see all the problems with the signatures
2425820 the last couple of days ive been checking the registrations myself on the computer
2425821 i want at least one debate nancy pelosi has to answer for her record
2425822 i wish they tortured those pieces of shit before killing them
2425823 we banned her how can she get on the ballot without us
2425824 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2425825 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2425826 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
2425827 there are things going on that are far more hurtful and destructive than anyone realizes
2425828 is thine eye evil because mine eye is good can i not do as i will with mine own i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy
2425829 i was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest to them that asked not after thee
2425830 i have mercies but i will leave men alone and when they feel their need of these mercies and seek me diligently with their whole heart day and night with tears and vows and supplications then will i bless them but not before
2425831 a certain man had a hundred sheep and one of them did go astray and he tarried at home and lo the sheep came back and he received it joyfully and said to his friends rejoice for the sheep that i have lost is come back
2425832 i should have thought that although the saviour might not require an earnest seeking and sighing and groaning and a continuous searching after him yet certainly he would have desired and demanded that every man before he had grace should ask for it
2425833 well i sought the lord four years before i found him
2425834 why because he led me to do it he must first have shown me my need of him or else i should never have sought him he must have shown me his preciousness or i never should have thought him worth seeking
2425835 why i am predestined not to be a hyper calvinist
2425836 why i am not predestined to represent the side i am critiquing accurately
2425837 i much question whether the man that dies an arminian can go to heaven
2425838 the old arminians mentioned in scripture are blamed for thinking wickedly that god was such an one as themselves but our new arminians out sin their predecessors and actually represent god as a being in many respects considerably inferior to themselves they suppose him both to form schemes with less wisdom and to execute them with less power spirit and success than a prime minister of common sense forms and executes his they dare ascribe to god such impotence blunders imperfections and disappointments as they would blush to ascribe to a ximenes or a sully
2425839 arminians consider the grace that is inspired into a true believers heart as a text of scripture written upon a pane of glass liable to be demolished by the first hand that flings a stone at it
2425840 all the disputes between us and the arminians may be reduced to these two questions 1 is god dependent on man or is man dependent on god 2 is man a debtor to god or god a debtor to man
2425841 the arminians think that in conversion god does little or nothing for men but gives them a pull by the elbow to awake them from their sleep rather he acts as maritime officers do by their sailors he cuts down the hammock of carnal security in which the elect are down they fall and the bruises and surprise they receive awaken them from their death in sin and bring them to themselves whether they will or no
2425842 according to arminianism grace has the name but free will the game
2425843 arminians suppose god to give us heaven as the king grants a brief for building a church
2425844 i can compare some ranting arminian preachers who represent salvation as a matter of chance and press men to help forward their own conversion upon pain of damnation to none so well as to auctioneers who with the hammer in their hands are always bawling out
2425845 awake and put on thy strength o arm of the lord breathe on these slain that they may live
2425846 a mans free will cannot cure him even of the tooth ache or of a sore finger and yet he madly thinks it is in its power to cure his soul
2425847 the greatest judgment which god himself can in the present life inflict upon a man is to leave him in the hand of his own boasted free will
2425848 look where you will and you will generally find that free willers are very free livers
2425849 saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves
2425850 thanks to the pharm test i now have first person experience with prison shower sex

2425853 set a regional and national standard for preservation of the environment
2425854 the limiting resource in our region is not land it is water
2425855 the health care delivery system regionally and nationally is not working
2425856 i would do whatever it takes to improve the management of the elections division
2425857 they had two meetings where you could go and ask a question but there were no department heads present
2425858 from what ive observed he leads the board not the other way around
2425859 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2425860 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2425861 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2425862 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2425863 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2425864 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2425865 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2425866 jack let me tell you something on my wedding night in our honeymoon suite i took off my pants and handed them to your mother and said here try these on
2425867 so she did and said these are too big i cant wear them
2425868 i replied exactly i wear the pants in this family and i always will
2425869 ever since that night we have never had any problems
2425870 exactly i wear the pants in this family and i always will and i dont want you to ever forget that
2425871 the doctrine of justification itself as preached by an arminian is nothing but the doctrine of salvation by works
2425872 from this doctrine i have not departed to this day
2425873 there is no soul living who holds more firmly to the doctrine of grace than do i
2425874 the old truth that calvin preached that augustine preached is the truth that i must preach today or else be false to my conscience and to god
2425875 i cannot find in scripture any other doctrine than this
2425876 w e are reckoned the scum of creation scarcely a minister looks on us or speaks favorable of us because we hold strong vies upon the divine sovereignty of god and his divine electings and special love towards his own people
2425877 where will you find holier and better men in the world
2425878 the tendency of arminianism is towards legality it is nothing but legality which lays at the root of arminianism
2425879 do you not see at once that this is legality that this is hanging our salvation upon our work that this is making our eternal life to depend upon something we do
2425880 if you believe that everything turns upon the free will of man you will naturally have man as its principal figure in your landscape
2425881 i believe that very much of current arminianism is simply ignorance of gospel doctrine
2425882 i do not serve the god of the arminians at all i have nothing to do with him and i do not bow down before the baal they have set up he is not my god nor shall he ever be i fear him not nor tremble at his presence the god that saith today and denieth tomorrow that justifieth today and condemns the next is no relation to my god in the least degree he may be a relation of ashtaroth or baal but jehovah never was or can be his name

2425891 yes ive stood on so and sos shoulders and i saw further

2425921 something i like to do is take a character who thinks she has it all together and yank the rug out from under them in maggie quinn is coasting along and suddenly discovers theres real magic and real monsters in the world in i wanted to change the rules on her again she has this psychic ability but i didnt want that to make things easy for her as far as solving mysteries is concerned just as she was starting to get comfortable with the idea that shes a psychic i made that into a liability for her by giving her an adversary who knows a lot more about this stuff than she does and knows how to use it against her and her family so the threat is really much more personal this time which means big emotional stakes too plus there are a lot more romantic complications this time too which was fun to write
2425922 i started years ago then put it aside when i realized i just didnt have the skill yet to write it a few years later after i was published i took it out once more and again realized i wasnt ready i dusted it off again about two years ago reworked a bunch of it and sold the first three in the series this is near and dear to my heart and im really hoping that readers enjoy it

2425944 the hot water heater was nice but i only used it a few times
2425945 hot water heater is only important if you drink a lot of tea hot chocolate
2425946 hot water heater is a must and cas dont care
2425947 lights arent a problem candles and anything that smokes is
2425948 holiday lights are pretty useless and not worth filling up the room
2425949 bed risers if you want them they really make a room seem nicer
2425950 definitely get the tallest bed risers possible and lots of under the bed storage
2425951 a big fridge is good if you think youll be eating in the room a lot but if you live near a dining hall you probably wont eat in the dorm as much if you like to munch drink things that need to be refridgerated bring it
2425952 everyone gets a big fridge and in the end theyre really not all that useful
2425953 i guess a big fridge might be okay for all your illegal alcohol
2425954 dont bring too much stuff seriously not only does lugging around unnecessary crap suck but your room will be cluttered in no time a simple clean room is the way to go especially when you share a room with another person trust me on this one youre not going to have time to play monopoly with that cute guy gal down the hall so dont bring it
2425955 ask yourself as you start to pack do i really need aunt mildreds vintage heirloom lace doily or the 26 volume oed less is totally more and you will be so cool when youre in unpacked and settled in under an hour so many more opportunities to make friends that way natch oh and while this should go without saying its totes uncool to match bedding with your roommate
2425956 bring whatever makes you feel comfortable dont worry about what you think everyone else has
2425957 youre going to want some really silly things that you never would think of childrens books feather boas make sure you bring at least two or three silly things from home small familiar things that you can cuddle with when you get homesick sick sick overwhelmed whatever
2425958 a mini sewing kit everyone on my floor came to me with popped off buttons
2425959 my fan i had it on all day every day the noise drowns out the screaming in the hallway
2425960 a bike get a bike very useful even in the winter get them at the bike sale though much better than buying a new one same functionality but 10 percent of the price
2425961 i hid my desk chair in the janitors closet and brought a nice office chair
2425962 dont forget bigger school supplies like staplers and a hole puncher
2425963 have a bin for food keep it stocked and dont let people mooch
2425964 bring a couple of plastic containers for the cereal sandwiches and other snacks you pilfer from the dinning hall
2425965 take advantage huge advantage of online shipping since the stores deliver stuff to your package center it is much easier to pick up and get a hand with
2425966 if you are shopping when you get there so is everyone else so try to get to the store early because theyll run out
2425967 the pack and save thing at bed bath and beyond was great so you could pick things out at home and have them be there for you when you got to the one in evanston
2425968 places like target and linens n things and the mall require a car to get to but there are also buses
2425969 your room is always smaller than you think if you plan on going home for breaks consider doing a clothing swap aka bring only summer fall clothes then swap out summer for winter clothes over break and swap the winter for summer over spring break it wont all fit if you dont have a big room
2425970 you will have to buy ugly woolly hats and scarves and you will have to wear them if you dont want to deal with this you should have gone to stanford
2425971 you may think youre too cool for your parents but move in day is not the time to start your independence let them come rent a car set up your room with them and go get stuff you still need dont tell your parents not to come so that you can meet people you have all of wildcat welcome to do that
2425972 under bed storage is a must but wait until you see your room
2425973 you need a cute essentials bowl somewhere you commit to putting things like keys and your wallet
2425974 hooks for the walls make a room a lot more livable
2425975 try to clean off the chain every day youll probably end up having to replace the chain in the spring anyway because road salt is really harsh
2425976 you cant ride on the sidewalk theres a city ordinance against it
2425977 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
2425978 this organization is a serious threat it has spread its tentacles not only throughout russia but also throughout tajikistan other countries of central asia and it has contacts in the european states
2425979 this organization has been qualified as extremist by the supreme courts of russia and tajikistan it is necessary to act in a joint effort against this evil otherwise the consequences could be catastrophic
2425980 a general plan is needed to work for prevention of the threat
2425981 i was let go because im in the media every day ive been down to the u s congress to testify ive been on cnn even thats why i was let go because if i caused them this much pain just in an investigation imagine what the trial would be like

2425984 hace sobre todo mucha humedad pero desde ayer intentamos hacer una cosa nueva y es que cada veinte minutos le doy la raqueta a mi entrenador francis roig y me cambia el grip envoltura de la empu adura con el sudor se empapaba y resbala enseguida

2425986 el emparejamiento de dobles es de lo peor que te puede tocar no hemos tenido suerte porque el equipo sueco es muy fuerte pero hay que jugarlo y vamos a intentar sacar el partido adelante

2425990 me gustar a ver otras cosas sobre todo alg n partido de baloncesto de espa a pero no creo que sea posible tendr a que ser eliminado muy pronto y si llego lejos no tendr mucho tiempo para quedarme
2425991 estoy centrado en los juegos ol mpicos no en el n mero uno ni en otra cosa ni pienso en celebrar el hecho de ser el n mero uno celebrarlo cuando tampoco en cuantas semanas voy a permanecer ah no me planteo nada de eso ahora
2425992 los juegos ol mpicos son diferentes a un grand slam y a la copa davis es una competici n que se juega cada cuatro a os distinta a otra pero tambi n muy importante es especial porque representas a tu pa s son emociones distintas
2425993 es el final de curso y es un momento importante est a n el abierto de estados unidos la copa davis el masters series de madrid la copa masters de shangai y otros
2425994 i was fascinated by the psychic i wanted to know what it felt like when youre channeling or doing whatever it takes to get to that state of mind so he changed my perspective on it
2425995 i would love to be able to contact people on the other side if i could speak to my grandmother tonight id be doing it so i do believe
2425996 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other
2425997 for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2425998 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk
2425999 and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2426000 and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core
2426001 i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am
2426002 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have

2426051 jammu gujjar muslims have always been nationalist supported army and have devoutly worked for the amarnath pilgrimage and vaishnav devi yatra yet they were attacked during the ongoing agitations over amarnath shrine land dispute
2426052 today muslim gujjars are frightened they have packed themselves in their homes fearing anytime one can attack them they are not going to work
2426053 we will meet the all party team coming from delhi and we will demand to form an enquiry to assess the economic damage done to gujjars we want that government of india or the state government should announce relief and compensation package for the the muslim gujjars
2426054 to protect the life and property of the nomadic muslim gujjars of jammu region who are facing adversities and hardships as more than 100 houses of the tribal group set afire by protesters in jammu samba and kathua districts during 38 day long agitation over the land row
2426055 our people are shelterless in many areas of jammu samba and kathua even more than 100 families are waiting for a relief and rehabilitation package
2426056 im moving up to the welterweight division and moving down to defend the lightweight title
2426057 when we all came back from the war it was all pushed to the back of our minds
2426058 as far as i could see it was total destruction
2426059 the city is built in a valley with a large number of hills surrounding it there wasnt much in that valley that was more than 2 to 3 feet tall
2426060 i said at the time that president truman could have given a demonstration of the bomb that might have been effective
2426061 i knew where my division was to land and we saw the 16 inch guns positioned on those beaches
2426062 they simply did what they believed was right and we did too
2426063 is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2426064 its the most important fight in my life right now
2426065 what i was saying was compared to my life compared to the stuff ive already gone through that fighting for me was a cakewalk
2426066 fighting kenny florians a cakewalk no offense to him that fighting is a cakewalk fighting in general is just a fight compared to the life i used to have thats all that that means
2426067 you know how i am with people im a good person im not a bad person and im never going to be
2426068 if you had to edit that to make me look bad then thats messed up or make me look arrogant or make me disrespecting my opponents thats pretty messed up im not that guy im never going to be that guy so dont make me look like im that guy
2426069 working with georges was amazing i learned a lot from him
2426070 hes an amazing champion an amazing role model somebody to really look up to if i were one day to become a champion i would like to be like georges hes a workaholic he trains hard hes a work horse
2426071 last year i really didnt have time to really sit down and train with phenomenal guys because i had a fight every two months
2426072 this year i was able to go and learn different skills and thats what were going to see on this next fight aug 9
2426073 im moving up to the welterweight division and moving down to defend the lightweight title
2426074 i rode my vespa 50 to work all winter december and january just not on days when there was snow and ice
2426075 i try to stay off the real busy streets but riding a
2426076 you smell things hear things and see things you would never notice in a car ive seen beautiful old houses in beautiful neighborhoods that i would never have seen because i would never have driven down those streets
2426077 i can sit like a lady and i dont have to shift
2426078 i think some of them are envious that ive got the guts to do this
2426079 i think there is some silver lining here in higher gas prices in that we will see a public health gain
2426080 when that happens we drive more we drive bigger cars we drive faster and fatalities are higher
2426081 the concept had been on the table for some years now all countries have finally agreed on the formation and implementation of the saarc food bank
2426082 properly realised it would serve as a milestone in strengthening the existing cooperation among the nations of south asia
2426083 this involves the construction of new food warehouses in member countries local procurement and the international purchase of extra food grains and developing an administrative system and a distribution network so it is likely that it will take some time before operationalising the saarc food bank

2426086 i feel very bitter that nobody does seem to even care even now that this report has been made public
2426087 i lost my innocence to men i did not have any idea who they were and now all that the french government can give back is rubbish all the evidence against its soldiers
2426088 recently i heard that they want to arrest our people for whatever they accused them at least they did not rape children like their own soldiers
2426089 i was brought by interahamwes to the stadium as they beat me and white soldiers dressed in military uniform were there one pulled me by hand and took me into a tent as i resisted he slapped me hard he tore my skirt off force my legs wide and penetrated me
2426090 i felt as if a metal was penetrating me the pain was so much i screamed so hard but nobody was helping me i was bleeding i felt it would be better if i died he finished raping me and moved out
2426091 we believed we were safe after the war was ending and we had seen whites bazungu claiming to have come to protect us we knew everything was ok
2426092 i was wrong my suffering was just going to start
2426093 in the stadium kamarampaka the interahamwe took me there directly and there were many white soldiers all over i was put in a room of the tent just near by and the next thing a huge white soldier entered and closed the tent closure and undressed
2426094 i was very small he just lifted me like a baby ripped off my cloths and he started raping me
2426095 the pain was terrible i screamed till i lost my breath i was bleeding profusely then he changed and penetrated me through my mouth
2426096 justice unfettered justice will one day be done power should not come with impunity
2426097 history shows that the road to justice is bumpy when genocide is involved due to the complexity of the crime its complicated but not impossible
2426098 this year were seeing more people who are looking for a way to get to work thats going to be a lot more economical
2426099 and with many of our scooters coming in at 90 miles per gallon we have that affordable option for them
2426100 weve probably saved around 40 a week says landon and with the couple expecting their first baby in just a few months and trying to save money here and there molissa says the scooter is the perfect transportation to work
2426101 its only a couple of blocks away from home so i figure its not worth getting in the car and wasting that much in gas its an exciting ride to work in the morning gas prices are outrageous every time we fill up our suv s its 60 here and 80 there it feels so good when you can go to the gas station and just put 4 50
2426102 you need to presume the cars are not going to see you depending on light or conditions its actually more difficult for drivers in vehicles to see motorcycles or bicycles
2426103 what can i say with the price of fuel it seemed like the smart thing to do i plans to use the scooter for commuting to work and for errands around town but doesnt think hell be taking it out in the rain or snow my friends has also bought a scooter for herself
2426104 you understand why the dog sticks his head out the window once you get on the scooter
2426105 its encouraging the motorcycle marke t continues to show resilience in the face of higher interest rates and general economic turbulence
2426106 the increase of over 6 per cent for the first half of 2008 demonstrates that the demand for bikes scooters and atvs has remained quite strong
2426107 the resurgence of the scooter market reflects commuter concerns over the prospect of rising fuel prices
2426108 the recent spike in pump prices has no doubt played a part in the turnaround in scooter sales since the march quarter
2426109 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia
2426110 two or three ounce servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day
2426111 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
2426112 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2426113 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2426114 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism
2426115 further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
2426116 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
2426117 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 00 p m and 11 39 p m friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
2426118 a small bubble in the rain cloud would have triggered rainfall
2426119 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2426120 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2426121 the right tire on the steer axle was a goodyear tire and it had been recapped
2426122 they cannot be placed on the steer axle of the bus
2426123 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2426124 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right or the passengers side where it came to rest
2426125 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2426126 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2426127 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2426128 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2426129 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2426130 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move
2426131 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2426132 there is progress but we have a long way to go
2426133 there is something here for every single constituency to dislike
2426134 we probably wont play as vibrant as role as in years past
2426135 wir rufen russland auf die luftwaffen und raketenschl ge gegen georgien einzustellen die territoriale integrit t georgiens zu respektieren und seine verb nde vom territorium georgiens abzuziehen

2426137 ranghohe us offizielle und ich haben mit beiden seiten gesprochen und arbeiten mit diesen weiter um den kampfhandlungen ein ende zu setzen die usa arbeiten aktiv auch mit ihren europ ischen partnern daran eine internationale vermittlung zu initiieren wir bitten russland uns bei diesen anstrengungen dringend zu unterst tzen

2426139 it was becoming more painful by the day it was growing

2426143 it was like a monster almost like an alien you had this thing in there

2426146 acted appropriately in seeking care that needed to be expedited

2426149 spillage of massive amounts of malignant cells through her abdominal and pelvic cavities

2426168 in dieser situation ist eine prinzipienfeste einsch tzung der aggressiven handlungen der georgischen beh rden notwendig die alle normen des v lkerrechts berschritten haben diese handlungen hatten zahlreiche opfer unter der zivilbev lkerung und russischen friedenssoldaten zur folge
2426169 der einzig m gliche und vern ftige ausweg w re der abzug der georgischen truppen aus der region und die unterzeichnung eines juristisch bindenden abkommens ber den gewaltverzicht durch tiflis
2426170 in dieser situation ist eine prinzipienfeste einsch tzung der aggressiven handlungen der georgischen beh rden notwendig die alle normen des v lkerrechts berschritten haben diese handlungen hatten zahlreiche opfer unter der zivilbev lkerung und russischen friedenssoldaten zur folge

2426172 die gegenw rtige georgische f hrung sprach immer von ihrer treue zur friedlichen beilegung bereitete aber von langer hand eine gewaltoperation gegen das ossetische volk vor
2426173 die s dossetischen kr fte haben keine chancen gegen georgien ohne russische hilfe und georgien hat keine chancen gegen russland ohne hilfe der usa da die us armee ihre aufgaben in afghanistan und im irak zu l sen hat wird es f r georgien keine bedeutende hilfe von seiten der usa geben
2426174 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
2426175 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
2426176 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
2426177 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
2426178 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
2426179 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
2426180 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
2426181 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
2426182 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
2426183 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
2426184 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
2426185 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
2426186 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
2426187 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
2426188 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
2426189 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
2426190 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
2426191 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
2426192 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
2426193 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
2426194 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
2426195 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
2426196 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
2426197 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
2426198 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
2426199 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
2426200 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
2426201 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
2426202 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
2426203 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
2426204 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
2426205 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
2426206 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
2426207 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
2426208 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
2426209 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
2426210 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
2426211 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
2426212 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
2426213 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
2426214 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
2426215 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2426216 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
2426217 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
2426218 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
2426219 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
2426220 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
2426221 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

2426231 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2426232 in his closed door meeting with house democrats tuesday night presumptive democratic nominee barack obama delivered a real zinger according to a witness suggesting that he was beginning to believe his own hype
2426233 obama was waxing lyrical about last weeks trip to europe when he concluded according to the meeting attendee this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for the 200 000 souls who thronged to his speech in berlin came not just for him he told the enthralled audience of congressional representatives i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions he said according to the source
2426234 oh you hear about this here you go paris hiltons mother is very upset because john mccain has put paris in his campaign video you know about this he put paris in his campaign video and shes furious isnt that amazing of all the videos paris hilton has been in this is the one moms upset about she said his ad featuring paris is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention just like paris basically
2426235 actually both britney spears and paris hilton have now commented on the john mccain political ad
2426236 president bush saw the ad today and he said i had no idea barack obama didnt wear underwear he was stunned when he heard
2426237 oh and the mccain campaign has accused barack obama of being elitist and using the race card yeah yeah the obama campaign accused mccain of being old and using the discover card
2426238 congress went on a five week vacation starting today and boy they deserve it dont they they got so much done this year solved the energy crisis health care social security immigration whew take a break fellows
2426239 you ever notice that congress doesnt even call it a vacation you know what they call it a recess you ever notice the only people that get recess are congress kindergarten and juries those are the only three the three groups you cant trust to make an adult decision basically
2426240 since congress went on recess oil prices have dropped to 118 a barrel thats like a 30 drop from the record high you know maybe congress should take more vacations huh you ever notice whenever these people leave town things just seem to get better
2426241 actually analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use resulting in falling oil prices yeah basically the worse the economy the lower the oil prices which means if bush could serve one more term oil would be free
2426242 today president bush left on a seven day trip to asia hes gonna visit south korea thailand and china thats right yeah or as bush refers to them china china and china not a detail guy
2426243 president bush is on a trip to asia ladies and gentlemen he will be spending the entire week in the orient usually bush is in the disorient
2426244 president bush left for the olympic games early in an effort to beat the traffic landing in south korea for a day of trade talks it seemed like just another ordinary trip for the president except its is his 134th visit to a foreign country its a record hes now officially this is true our most traveled president in history its a little suspicious perhaps validating what i have been saying all along president george w bush either has a thirst for international knowledge or is a drug mule
2426245 but there is no denying the presidents a hard core man of the road bush of course also holds the record for most presidential vacation days 506 and counting you know between that and the travel days i think its clear there is something about being at the white house our president cannot stand stewart imitates bush i cant help but think that im sleeping in the same bed where my mom and dad used to do it that is disturbing on many different levels
2426246 china has announced that during the olympics protesters will be allowed to assemble in designated protest areas yeah or as theyre commonly called in china jails
2426247 barack obama has agreed to debate john mccain three times this fall both candidates have conditions obama wants the debates to be held on college campuses mccain wants them to be held before 7 00 p m
2426248 today the moderators were announced for the upcoming presidential debates good yeah apparently barack obama insisted on someone who asks even handed probing questions while john mccain insisted on someone who will talk into his good ear

2426259 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2426260 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2426261 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2426262 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2426263 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2426264 haut d bit coup denvoi du foot sur ladsl dorange
2426265 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2426266 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2426267 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2426268 i played my first six years or so making the semis with ease with the bulldogs and to come here and have a couple of tough years has been hard
2426269 the last few years ive looked back and thought gee ive taken finals football for granted
2426270 so to be back in the mix im just really looking forward to playing it again
2426271 i know were going to be there now so im excited about it but i also know weve got another 4 5 games to go so im definitely making sure i dont get ahead of myself
2426272 the broncos are always around in the semi finals theyve got a great team and theyre sort of breathing down our necks a little bit
2426273 if they get a bit of momentum and we lose some we could end up out of the four
2426274 it wouldnt be the end of the world but its something we dont really want to happen
2426275 we are continually committed to providing our customers with the highest quality language translation and localization services this certification adds another layer to our commitment
2426276 furthermore this program will enable us to develop new relationships and partnerships with companies that have minority business quotas that they may have for their suppliers

2426284 it is a tragic occurrence whenever a child is hurt or killed in a vehicle accident
2426285 the fact that a parent or other close relative is often involved compounds the tragedy our goal is to make the back up camera technology that can help avoid these tragedies affordable to more families

2426298 being green has been a way of life for me ever since i was a little boy coming from a poor working class family in south philadelphia the only means i had to produce my art was with materials i found at first stealing markers and spray paint for graffiti seemed to be the perfect fit until a hard lesson left me with a broken heart and a sore body i moved on to card board boxes and old copy books which were great but were not giving my 110 satisfaction it wasnt until the idea of stretching canvas on an old window frame that i felt i was on the right path with old bed sheets in hand i started to craft perfect canvases to paint on from items destined for land fills now with nearly all of my materials coming from recycled means my art work leaves a soft ecological footprint and a great story for society joey kilrain

2426321 we need to be free from the consolidation thats going on typified by monsanto buying up seed companies if were going to be a viable sustainable organic community weve got to be independent in our seed resources
2426322 we apply the selection pressure and then the plant actually decides how to get there this is so different from genetic engineering in genetic engineering we insert a gene and thats the way the plant is going to be in selection the plant actually decides the mechanism by which its going to make a new type and then we enjoy the benefits most plant breeders have a lot of fun doing this
2426323 even though for 10 000 years growers had the right to plant back what they grew in our generation thats going away
2426324 he left variation in those lines so the growers could develop far more varieties

2426326 i hear a lot why are you going to make us grow organically so well starve were not im here to tell you the average wheat yield in kansas with as many inputs as they can dump on it is 36 bushels per acre were going to starve if we keep growing conventional wheat in kansas
2426327 thats a problem if you have one breeding program if youre selecting in a conventional system for organic youre selecting the wrong wheats so we have a separate breeding program for organic
2426328 growing wheat is easy harvesting it is not if you dont have a combine and on farm storage
2426329 you can easily grow an acre of wheat and harvest it by hand and put it through a thresher

2426355 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2426356 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2426357 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2426358 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2426359 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2426360 the erosion paintings reveal my passion for paint and my deeply felt connection to the earth in the abstract patterning of the paintings i am exploring the ways rocks are formed and distributed in the landscape
2426361 these abstract patterns are also objects of meditation reminders of place and of the geological forces that formed our contemporary landscape

2426367 i dont really believe that at this point people are having to choose between food and medicine and housing and if they are its because they made poor choices with their mortgages i dont believe people are devastated i dont see whats wrong with the unemployment rate its not that bad i think the unemployment rate is mostly for people who dont want to or cant work anyways

2426370 i am often asked what element of my career has been the most personally fulfilling
2426371 many expect me to answer that it is a certain piece of legislation from my time in the senate or perhaps some work internationally but in truth what is most meaningful to me is the creation of this scholarship program besides my family it is the most important thing in my life this annual brunch with the mitchell scholars is one of the highlights of my summer i always look forward to the opportunity to meet these commendable young men and women and to congratulate them and express my pride in their achievements

2426378 the paper concludes that initial breastfeeding particularly when exclusive is associated with lower blood cholesterol concentrations in later life compared to initial formula feeding
2426379 this study provides further evidence that breast feeding has long term health benefits apart from all its other effects it appears to lower blood cholesterol in later life
2426380 the results also suggest that formula feeds should match the context of breast milk as closely as possible any attempt to reduce the fat content of formula feeds could be counter productive
2426381 what we ve found is of national and international importance
2426382 certainly in the u k and europe as far as we know

2426385 i think that i have a lifetime of experience that i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and obama has a speech he gave in 2002

2426404 as far back as i can remember ive been a news junkie
2426405 while it is true that after ronaldos decision to stay at manchester united it is harder for robinho to leave he will do everything he can to make it happen
2426406 they attack me because the next day its in the newspapers its free publicity
2426407 chelsea have made a formal proposal to real madrid for robinho i do not know the amount but the offer has been made
2426408 robinho is very angry with the way that the directors of real madrid have been behaved towards him
2426409 he calls me every day to see if anyone has told me anything about his future and i have to tell him that i have received no calls
2426410 i have spent three days trying to speak with some of the directors at madrid but they have all disappeared
2426411 he has liked nothing about the way that real madrid have gone about their transfer activity this summer
2426412 real madrid wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo and have not been able to
2426413 things cannot be like that because he wants to be the best and he does not have the support at real madrid he is also certain that real madrid is trying to sign david villa
2426414 robinhos plan has been to play for real madrid for many years and then go back to santos where is he going to find a better club than real madrid
2426415 definitely he robinho is going to stay with us the coach bernd schuster has said he wants him in our team
2426416 we dont see any possibility of him leaving real madrid
2426417 that is what it is all about we want to be there in the champions league and opponents like this are ones we shall face the boss said we were second best in the first half but we created chances and in the second half were more aggressive i think we deserved it
2426418 i love playing for this team and for these fans i will always give 100 per cent

2426425 do you not know that those who run in a race all run but only one receives the prize
2426426 oh im just one of the humble members around here you should ask brother so and so hell probably do it
2426427 if god is for us who can be against us
2426428 i can do all things through him who strengthens me
2426429 a man could live for ten or twenty years without once remembering that he is living among christians and is himself reckoned a member of the orthodox christian church
2426430 i pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in christ
2426431 and i keep praying that this faith we hold in common keeps showing up in the good things we do and that people recognize christ in all of it
2426432 who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with contempt
2426433 the intersection between his philosophical and devotional work can be found in the simple question
2426434 teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self controlled upright and godly lives in this present age while we wait for the blessed hope the appearing of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own eager to do what is good
2426435 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear
2426436 and why do you worry about clothes see how the flowers of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you that not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own

2426440 since my youth o god you have taught me and to this day i declare your marvelous deeds even when i am old and gray do not forsake me o god till i declare your power to the next generation your might to all who are to come
2426441 ive got the team off to a good start and the team should be buzzing now
2426442 we were all a bit down after what happened to frankie then getting a bad draw
2426443 i was fighting a good fighter and in the last two rounds i got my rhythm but i still wasnt at my best
2426444 if i come back from china with a medal ill be happy
2426445 other contenders include susanne ljungskog of sweden kristin armstrong of the united states and nicole cooke of britain the 126 4 kilometer 78 5 mile womens road race begins in central beijing and ends at the great wall of china
2426446 but i think they are even more skillful than belgium
2426447 the new zealanders participating in their first olympic soccer tournament got off to a surprising start by drawing 1 1 with host china despite playing with 10 men since the 39th minute they looked like they had held on for the victory until allowing an 88th minute equalizer
2426448 they play very well on balls crossed into the area we will have to be careful
2426449 new zealand has only three players in european soccer captain ryan nelsen of blackburn rovers midfielder simon elliott of fulham and forward chris killen of celtic brazil has 11 players in european clubs
2426450 our girls were challenged by the fact we have never played belarus
2426451 for us it was a significant game and i think our recent loss in the diamond ball against the usa helped prepare us for today
2426452 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2426453 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
2426454 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
2426455 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
2426456 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
2426457 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
2426458 i have to say exactly where i will be for every hour for the next three months
2426459 and that was at a leaving party before i came out here
2426460 sure i might be chesty the day after but the heat and in particular the humidity will hurt me far more trust me there will be a whole lot of dnfs did not finish in every endurance sport walkers cyclists marathon runners triathletes they will all struggle
2426461 but in beijing the combination of heat and humidity could be far worse
2426462 i consider myself a fan of the olympics this time around i just cant get excited about the games
2426463 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2426464 what we have here is a full scale russian invasion of georgian territory
2426465 russia has attacked georgia that means that russia is trying to basically either attack georgia overall or to chop off a piece of its territory
2426466 we are a small freedom flooded democratic country with a small population very motivated very determined to defend ourselves
2426467 a sheer clear and blunt aggression that parallels the worst examples of the 20th century and certainly is unheard of and unparalleled in modern times

2426471 if they new zealand come here and play the series they would be more than welcome but if they want to skip then it would be their decision we are not desperate for the series
2426472 weve already played around 20 one dayers and will play more in the champions trophy so there is no desperation over the new zealand series

2426477 why not consider an enclosed private garden area outside a full height window or pair of french doors
2426478 just make sure you have something wonderful to look at be it a raked japanese garden or riot of bougainvillea color
2426479 different levels within a bathroom create lots of interesting opportunities such as a standard height counter that opens up to display a dropped sit down vanity and split level counters with sinks that facilitate seniors or small children i like the idea of an area for salon activities keeping nail polish and remover in the bathroom is always a good idea
2426480 probably the least used product to date for countertops is slab glass but as recycling creates the demand we will see more fabricators able to produce more than just synthetic tops with glass chips thrown in as accent
2426481 practically speaking the luxury of a lit magnifying mirror has become almost de rigueur especially with an aging population though a bit pricey waterworks and bagi make beautiful ones i love the look of large wall mirrors with leds behind them making the mirror look suspended
2426482 if youre adding any lighting to your current bath make sure you use dimmer switches as well as separate switching for control to create more of a mood for the bathroom
2426483 it has a huge mirror from the counter to the ceiling behind our two sinks that makes the bathroom seem even 10 times larger
2426484 its got a real timeless feeling to it its not trendy in any way and its just gorgeous
2426485 we still go to really nice hotels but now we think they are not quite as nice and we cant wait to get home

2426490 the mark of christianity is the paradox the absolute paradox
2426491 if subjectivity is truth and subjectivity is the existing subjectivity then if i may put it this way christianity is a perfect fit subjectivity culminates in passion christianity is paradox paradox and passion fit each other perfectly and paradox perfectly fits a person situated in the extremity of existence
2426492 we are all sorry for what has happened we believe all issues can be resolved by dialogue
2426493 conflict is not what we want to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for
2426494 the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for
2426495 it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict
2426496 it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games

2426498 i wanted to do a project for the whole country and it turns out the front lawn is a unique space we all share
2426499 it has a big impact on how people engage the world when its a lawn its a division when its an edible landscape youre out there every day and people want to know whats happening some of the gardeners had lived in their homes 15 years and still knew few neighbors shortly after switching to edible front landscapes they knew all the neighbors
2426500 it shows how deeply embedded the front lawn is when theres an alternative we appreciate it but have a hard time believing its ok

2426530 unification for the sake of unification is not the path we decided to go down
2426531 in the end what matters most is what consumers are looking for but having too many people on the design phase especially early on would have hurt the project you could have three different user interfaces and a couple of application layers that doesnt make sense
2426532 a lot has happened in the last 12 months to push us in this direction
2426533 from our perspective creating a platform in a mobile space is not like building for the pc with mobile you are fighting for every spare 500 kilobytes you can find we know because we are building handsets right now so instead of adding in compatibility for everything we think it is important to clarify for developers the best possible direction and make it open source so it is available to more people

2426541 sites like rivals com were revolutionary because they brought their readers extremely closer to the college game than anyone had ever been before and its all in one easy reliable place the information just wasnt there before and they took advantage but now the information is as accessible as ever its why everybody knows that matt barkley is a 5 star recruit and that 1 recruit in the country usc blitz revolutionizes the way through which my users can interact with the world of college football

2426804 she has had to overcome so many obstacles in her personal and athletic life and now her dreams have finally been realized her dedication and perseverance are an inspiration to the rest of us melanie truly embodies the olympic spirit and wish her all the best as she continues this journey i am glad to have played a small roll in this triumph
2426805 if it wasnt for dr bray and the wonderful job he did on my surgery i would never be in this position
2426806 at first i was a bit apprehensive because you hear about so many horror stories with back surgery but i knew a lot of wonderful people that really believed in dr bray and i went on faith the main reason i selected him was the fact that he understood the mind of an athlete
2426807 the care he put into my surgery taking extra time to save every muscle fiber possible to speed the recovery peeling away the muscle just stretching it rather than cutting it made the recovery that much quicker and smoother
2426808 dr bray was so smart and open minded he gave me guidance but trusted me and my coach john thrush to let me go at the pace i was comfortable with and trust my body my back is stronger than it has ever been and within seven months i was 100 and beyond what i was before the surgery
2426809 before i had no idea the surgery existed and thought that this was the pain i was going to have to live with for the rest of my life
2426810 athletics aside i am so glad i did it just for quality of life purposes because when you have the deep sore ache in your back it affects every part of your life and your daily routine including picking up my children other people suffering back pain should really consider exploring this type of surgery
2426811 melanies case is the perfect illustration of treating a back injury or back pain initially through conservative measures and then selecting surgery as the last option
2426812 her procedure also highlights the revolution taking place in this field in the past back surgeries were very lengthy required long hospitalization stays and extended recuperation and rehabilitative periods today even some fusions can be done on an outpatient basis and innovative stabilization devices that implanted maintain range of motion melanies situation is far from unique and it is important for people suffering from back pain to do their research and learn as much as they can about the variety of options available to them with a qualified surgeon
2426813 what borrowers need to know about credit scoring models and credit scores
2426814 after consulting with the federal reserve board and the federal trade commission earlier this year fair isaac has decided to include consideration of authorized user trade lines present on the credit report
2426815 this was nothing more than good old fashioned smoke and mirrors politics
2426816 since there was nothing the fair isaac corp could legally do about it they sent out press releases saying the complete opposite and ill informed reporters at nearly every major media outlet believed them the story was splashed all over newspapers web sites and tv stations without ever stopping to ask legal counsel whether or not fico could actually get away with such an atrocity when the general public saw these stories on msn com nbc and in the new york times they just believed them to be true

2426819 there certainly is a lot of interest in hydrogen cars at the moment
2426820 some people cant wait for these cars to be commercially available theyve jumped on the hydrogen band wagon and are having a go at diy conversion kits in fact weve already insured one it was built with a diy kit that the chap bought off ebay to convert his own motor
2426821 although we have insured this one id advise caution when dealing with kits
2426822 some tend to be a bit unstable but professional factory built kits properly installed should be fine
2426823 as for cost weve found they dont cost much more than a regular car to insure we expect the premiums to be only about 5 higher

2426839 women are shaping their lives in new and exciting ways
2426840 many moms want the joys of having a family without sacrificing their looks which are an important part of their self image i think that idea of having it all while it can be stressful for some women is empowering for others who have a particular idea of what they want their lives to be about
2426841 i think some of the increased interest in mommy makeover procedures has to do with women seeing plastic surgery as a good choice for improving areas of their bodies that just seem out of their control
2426842 if youve had a baby and despite taking care of yourself those loose muscles and that little roll of fat on your tummy just wont go away plastic surgery makes a lot of sense to you its about restoring the appearance you previously enjoyed or maybe even looking better than you ever have
2426843 i think its important to emphasize that during the consultation i provide a complete examination and recommend procedures tailored to a womans needs
2426844 customizing the makeover experience plays a huge role in a womans happiness with her results
2426845 my primary concern is patient safety combination surgeries must be performed with a high degree of skill precision and care the benefit to the patient is that she is able to enjoy a faster recovery and quickly return to caring for her family

2426851 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2426852 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2426853 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2426854 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2426855 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2426856 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2426857 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2426858 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2426859 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2426860 at this point im thinking of presenting a new formula to expand and launch a new perspective to raise the speed of the process

2426901 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
2426902 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable

2426980 i dont remember anything except for those two plays those things are 100 percent unacceptable i am disgusted about those turnovers you cant make excuses for something like that
2426981 after the game i was halfway in tears because i had not been out there in so long like two years
2426982 i was happy just to get the opportunity to play again i was happy and at the same time a little bit nervous i was all over the place
2426983 he looked really good i think we have something special with those three running backs
2426984 a running back should always be low if you have to get that extra yardage thats what you have to do
2426985 we all would like to take a look at this tomorrow i made a couple of good plays but i had a couple of opportunities out there too

2426994 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2426995 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2426996 wow 2 kids this is going to be hard work
2426997 after the first six months it all goes back to normal
2426998 here fishy fishy fishymatthew 5 14 16 i went to
2426999 we want people to change their behavior and use more water efficient products for landscaping
2427000 it never occurred to me that in a state that has an extreme water shortage every city wouldnt do everything they possibly could to save water
2427001 ill go ahead and take the state and national level i know some people on the city council here
2427002 turf or acceptable dry climate ground cover is allowed in the frontyard
2427003 within the first year i lived there four houses a combination of victorian colonial revival and craftsman were moved into french park
2427004 there was one guy who came back four or five times
2427005 he just wanted to look at the artistry of how the home was designed and built
2427006 its a tucked away neighborhood that not everyone knows about
2427007 in most cases owners want to bring the home back to its original glory
2427008 we should all be cautious with those kinds of allegations
2427009 the jury is not going to understand the case unless they understand the relationship
2427010 this is not irrelevant its going to be part of the case part of the proof
2427011 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses
2427012 that all of us had a struggle a conversion or a transformation and that all of us had a desire to help other people
2427013 sarah was only 15 when she had a secret abortion
2427014 had someone in her family known about the abortion sarahs life could have been saved
2427015 the courts have recognized that in ballot arguments proponents are allowed to engage in hyperbole
2427016 its absolutely false to say if someone had known about it her life would be saved
2427017 had someone in her family known sarahs life could have been saved
2427018 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2427019 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2427020 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2427021 have a profound impact on his ability to go forward with a public life
2427022 one of the very strong pieces of john edwards was his relationship with his wife
2427023 he was seen as the kind of husband that a lot of men would like to be in those situations and that a lot of wives would like to have he became a model husband in that circumstance
2427024 this is the kind of thing that is really gut wrenching
2427025 what if he had won the nomination what kind of mess would that have put this party in
2427026 i come home and i find myself alone again and i need your voice on the phone
2427027 has spoken for years about russian policies that threaten the sovereignty of its neighbors
2427028 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2427029 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth its like what any other country does
2427030 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china

2427034 he went to hospital and he will have a scan today he has difficulty in walking
2427035 he will definitely miss the next game we have to be careful about injuries
2427036 they competed in the heavyweights this year and they werent just big they were fat
2427037 you could tell they were tubby and were thinking that that may help us
2427038 it will be interesting to see what they can do and whether they can do all that and handle the heat at the same time
2427039 it was great i really wanted to kick the goal i didnt kick it that well but it went through
2427040 what i really wanted was to get through the match and get across the line
2427041 you cant help but think about september we still have a lot of work ahead of us but we are certainly giving ourselves a chance of going a long way in september
2427042 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
2427043 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2427044 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2427045 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2427046 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2427047 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2427048 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2427049 its sufficient to say something may have occurred in that area at that time
2427050 but were not necessarily restricting our investigation to that time
2427051 give me homey hot and sexy sweet fun loving and smart and ill work three jobs to keep that lady in my cave

2427057 because of her knowledge of law and of zoning and her ability to really make things happen people had tremendous respect for her opinion on things
2427058 no one has any idea of how much judith has done in her quiet behind the scenes way
2427059 its a great day for all the people of philadelphia
2427060 zoning is at the heart of every civic organization and this was an attack
2427061 judith is the scourge of the zoning board the woman on the other side of the table who gives them nothing but grief
2427062 but the neighborhood groups were clamoring for someone on the board who knew about you know zoning and design and planning and didnt curtsy whenever a developer passed by and thats judith
2427063 you come here and you realize that philadelphia is such a great place to live you can walk in center city from river to river and see such an array of architectural treasures as there is literally nowhere else in the world
2427064 my strategy was to sit next to the prettiest girl and offer to tutor her but it didnt work because she was smarter than i was
2427065 so we became friends i went to israel for a year and when i came back we started to date
2427066 i called judith asking if she knew anyone willing to sublet an apartment for a few months
2427067 she surprised me by responding why dont you just come live with us
2427068 life with judith eden could be intimidating at first youd walk into the living room where she was sitting amidst piles of newspapers and magazines and then shed just start to interrogate you she wanted to know about everything and she was whip smart and very opinionated
2427069 but once youd proven your mettle with her she showered you with this fierce loyal love that could only be called maternal at the edens encouragement i kept a key to their front door for years afterward like so many others i was part of the extended family
2427070 she was such an inspiration to all of us women
2427071 because she was such a feminist but she loved to dress she always had these funky elegant glasses was always well put together was very elegant but quirky with a sense of humor she had the driest sense of humor
2427072 we are delighted to be going to toronto we have such incredible fans there and we are amazed at such a positive reaction its a great place and we cant wait to get back there well done toronto

2427081 oh man do you know how much that would hurt
2427082 if you cant stand the heat dont read over my shoulder
2427083 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2427084 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2427085 when will i get the money to buy a new cellphone
2427086 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2427087 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2427088 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2427089 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2427090 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2427091 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2427092 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2427093 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2427094 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2427095 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2427096 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2427097 who are open to doing something on the production side
2427098 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2427099 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2427100 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2427101 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2427102 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2427103 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2427104 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2427105 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2427106 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2427107 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2427108 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2427109 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2427110 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2427111 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2427112 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2427113 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2427114 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2427115 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2427116 confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2427117 the child is not the mere creature of the state
2427118 alternative to placing ones children in government schools which frequently push harmful political and social agendas
2427119 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
2427120 would undermine a practice that has been if not actively encouraged at least acknowledged and accepted by officials and the public for many years
2427121 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children
2427122 parents do not have an unfettered right to dictate the terms of their childrens education
2427123 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2427124 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2427125 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2427126 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2427127 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2427128 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2427129 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2427130 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2427131 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2427132 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2427133 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2427134 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2427135 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2427136 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2427137 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2427138 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2427139 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2427140 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2427141 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2427142 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2427143 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2427144 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2427145 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2427146 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2427147 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2427148 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2427149 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2427150 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2427151 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2427152 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2427153 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2427154 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2427155 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2427156 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2427157 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2427158 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2427159 si pudiera pedirme una ultima cosa que seria recibir un beso de mis labios
2427160 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2427161 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2427162 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2427163 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2427164 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2427165 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2427166 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2427167 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2427168 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2427169 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2427170 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2427171 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2427172 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2427173 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2427174 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2427175 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2427176 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2427177 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2427178 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2427182 these actions have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability
2427183 policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now theyre just hoping they dont pull back
2427184 the cost of mortgage credit is getting pushed higher by the issues in the marketplace
2427185 they cant reduce their market exposure and that means more expensive mortgages
2427186 any time theres an additional imposition of fees in obtaining a mortgage it knocks some potential buyers out of the market
2427187 these are people who often rely on their good credit to buy investment properties putting little or no money down
2427188 they were created to provide liquidity in times of crisis
2427189 if they dont do that whats the point of having fannie and freddie in the first place
2427190 we are launching music onebox to give users an easy and legal way to find the music theyre looking for and to give music labels and publishers a new channel to distribute promote and make money off of their valuable music content
2427191 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2427192 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2427193 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
2427194 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road
2427195 looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at your offices at 123 main street at 3pm if anything changes you can reach me on my mobile at 310 555 1212
2427196 treat each custom er as if they were a member of our family
2427197 the first thing i ever smelled was there s something irresistible about
2427198 its pretty special most of our players are at university and some of them have nine to five jobs so this is quite a change
2427199 nothing is bigger than this its going to be one hell of a night
2427200 its not everyday you get to play brazil and the names that roll off their team sheet
2427201 first and foremost we are concentrating on getting a decent result but we dont want to look too far ahead its not a case of putting all our eggs in the belgium basket
2427202 its just not in our make up to write this game off and it would be a disservice to the players to do so
2427203 if we just try and hold them at bay i think we are going to get trounced
2427204 boils down to being able to realize our substantial growth potential
2427205 definitely on the table that is something were looking at in the future for us were looking at doing some experiments obviously one way is that you can start selling things for 1 05 1 09 1 15 and other ways you could have more of a break between your 99 cents price point and the next price point
2427206 is only starting to sink in to the general public
2427207 this in turn means that we are all collectively going to be relying less on assets and more on good old fashioned wage and salary income for future savings
2427208 theres just no way you can really save out of the median income in this country and retire comfortably
2427209 the thinking is that were ahead of the rest of the world in the economic cycle
2427210 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2427211 we want to focus on building customer relationships especially through our retail offices
2427212 ik hoop dat we deze week echt niemand meer tegenkomen mopperde ik ik wel zei eric rustig ik ben namelijk heel trots op mijn dames
2427213 zijn we lekker een dagje weg moet ik weer naar die zielige mensen kijken
2427214 when a famous boxers life is threatened monk takes the case and finds himself in the middle of a big championship fight
2427215 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that
2427216 the only way to clean up the contamination which is under the slab of the building is to take the building down and dig out the contamination
2427217 si pudiera pedirme una ultima cosa que seria recibir un beso de mis labios
2427218 a bit to much time contemplating the weed youve just pulled out if you ask me
2427219 hurry up whenever he goes just to help him learn the word gt
2427220 its sufficient to say something may have occurred in that area at that time
2427221 but were not necessarily restricting our investigation to that time
2427222 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2427223 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2427224 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2427225 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2427226 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act
2427227 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2427228 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2427229 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2427230 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2427231 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2427232 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2427233 we knew where he was and he knew where we were
2427234 of course a lot of the trail wasnt finished we had to bushwhack
2427235 this has more enduring social value than a round of golf
2427236 i was going broke buying film because arizona is so beautiful
2427237 every time i saw a cactus i was taking a picture
2427238 the best jobs i have are the ones i dont get paid for
2427239 one is frustrated this has taken so long then there is a sense of pride im seeing what has happened it was worth the wait
2427240 until the judge tells us what to do these people are not going to get this horse
2427241 set a regional and national standard for preservation of the environment
2427242 the limiting resource in our region is not land it is water
2427243 the health care delivery system regionally and nationally is not working
2427244 i would do whatever it takes to improve the management of the elections division
2427245 they had two meetings where you could go and ask a question but there were no department heads present
2427246 from what ive observed he leads the board not the other way around
2427247 proof that the second coming of jesus christ is nigh without a state of israel in the holy land there cannot be the second coming of jesus christ nor can there be a last judgement nor the end of the world
2427248 the massive support extended to the state of israel by millions of christian supporters of zionism is overtly motivated by a single consideration that the return of the jews to the holy land will be a prelude to their acceptance of christ when he returns or for those who fail to do so to their physical destruction
2427249 it just surprised us a little bit how long that small an amount of mercury can stick around in carpet
2427250 it depends on your family situation if youve got young children in the home then i would strongly recommend considering pulling out the carpet
2427251 i have to have at least 20 of them in my house
2427252 if i have to go through that once or twice a year with the money i save its worth it
2427253 i think this technology is phasing out its an interim technology
2427254 we will see how they react against a good team that throws the football
2427255 we have had good physical contact im pleased with our progress
2427256 in scrimmages you start to build some continuity and confidence on both sides of the ball i want a clean scrimmage protect the football no foolish penalties things like that
2427257 i was amazed by how chinese culture of five thousand years can be presented via modern technology
2427258 it is so creative and i believe china can impress the rest of the world with a new face shown at the opening ceremony
2427259 for the 4 hour opening ceremony numerous chinese people have been practicing for about three years
2427260 i appreciate their commitment to being a host of this world game
2427261 it will be my first time to be in china and i am so excited about it

2427263 can we be sure that if the tailor of ulm had been crippled rather than killed by his disastrous fall he would immediately have got to his feet to try again or that his friends would not have tried to prevent him doing so and secondly what actual contribution did he make to the subsequent history of aeronautics in relation to communism such questions are especially pointed and difficult above all because at its theoretical formation it had claimed to be not an inspiring ideal but part of a historical process already under way and of a real movement that was changing the existing state of things communism therefore always entailed a factual test a scientific analysis of the present and a realistic prognosis of the future to prevent it dissolving into myth

2427271 i do not believe that these migrants are only trying to escape poverty i believe they are also seeking freedom knowledge and wealth desire is a constructive potenza and is particularly powerful when it is implanted in poverty poverty in fact is not simply misery but is also the possibility of very many things which desire indicates and labour produces the migrant has the dignity of the person who seeks after truth production and happiness and this is the strength that breaks the enemys capacity to isolate and exploit and which removes together with the supposed prometheanism every heroic and or theological tendency from the behaviour of the poor and subversive

2427273 the thing that lay half bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin it was not quite dead but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside bits of shoe leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown near the central desk a revolver had fallen a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired the thing itself however crowded out all other images at the time it would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions it was partly human beyond a doubt with very manlike hands and head and the goatish chinless face had the stamp of the whateleys upon it but the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated
2427274 we now realize the absolute truth of the statement formulated for the first time by marx and engels as the scientific basis of socialism in the great charter of our movement the communist manifesto socialism they said will become a historical necessity socialism is inevitable not merely because proletarians are no longer willing to live under conditions imposed by the capitalist class but further because if the proletariat fails to fulfil its duties as a class if it fails to realize socialism we shall crash down to a common doom
2427275 the occurence of events is assured they may not happen everywhere and all the time but events have occurred and will occur
2427276 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
2427277 this could be what underlies addiction dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
2427278 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
2427279 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
2427280 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
2427281 for far too long the accent was placed on creativity people are only creative to the extent they avoid tasks and supervision work is a supervised task its model political and technical work is attended by dirt and detritus intrudes destructively into matter is abrasive to what is already achieved critical toward its conditions and is in all this opposite to that of the dilettante luxuriating in creation
2427282 it is better to do nothing than to work formally toward making visible what the west declares to exist
2427283 attended by dirt and detritus intrud ing destructively into matter and abrasive to what is already achieved

2427289 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2427290 my suggestion to apple create several options that allow expansion with a more balanced system spec instead of being heavy in the cpu department and lacking everywhere else offer a few more graphics card options and work with third party manufacturers to offer more compatible add in cards and apple may swing more favorable impressions from loyal windows pc users
2427291 can you build the exact same spec feature for feature as apple for cheaper

2427302 i wouldnt be surprised if soon we get a call from a middle eastern prince or shah willing to give something sweet to his many wives on his next trip to the city
2427303 im sorry but ill do it again as soon as youre not watching
2427304 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
2427305 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
2427306 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
2427307 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
2427308 these arent the most important buildings in ohio by any means but collectively the wright field historic district is very important and these buildings are part of that

2427310 ive got thirty nine let out a whistle here dolly
2427311 they say this as if the government of fashola is the lawless type that would trade off the peoples right for sentiment
2427312 christians can go to this extent to drag gods name down in a shady deal we suspect some foul games because they are so afraid of letting this out in the media whatever their fears we dont know but at least we know this would get to the higher authorities of the church the provincial head here is in every way ungodly and his disposition says it all the way he has so far conducted himself is startling but we will ensure that these pretentious men of god are exposed
2427313 it was the man taye amure that sold us out he went to mecca with the kabiyesi only to come back compromised the case had been seen through to the point that our new buyers would never have got into this crisis even when the police instructed the oba to pay us our n30 million from the land deal he had agreed to do so at the police station but came back and said the money had been put into the settlement of the case at the police station but i can tell you that the amure family did not sell any land to the redeemed people the people we sold land to are the oil company and they are so recognised by this family we will go to any length to see that this injustice does not see the light of the day we are behind them that is the story in a nutshell
2427314 thevar had told his brother father and other close relatives that he was depressed and didnt want to live
2427315 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2427316 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2427317 the current test is uncomfortable not entirely accurate and difficult for the elderly children and people with disabilities
2427318 past the age of 60 every person has to go for this test every two years before renewing their drivers licence people tire from it quickly and it reports false information on a large number of people who are unable to sit still in the machine
2427319 the vip was appreciated by all of the doctors who wanted to test it for themselves they know the problems with the current visual field test and welcome a new solution

2427322 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys the daily telegraph quoted terian as saying
2427323 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
2427324 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball
2427325 and watching him the boys would scream and say watch the child jesus what he does over the waves of the sea many would gather there and watching him would be amazed

2427337 so i said your ass is grass and im a lawnmower anyhow thats why my butt shows a tint of lime green
2427338 its an arrow from an o its the o from the who
2427339 our carriage was full of young people and we were having fun then there was the crash chaos people were dying they had no legs and arms i am alive i have been born again
2427340 already when we started with this album it felt obvious that this album would be called just backyard babies
2427341 we aimed to give our listeners and fans an early christmas present like no other
2427342 its a collection of a bunch of moments in my life
2427343 im just trying to be as honest as i can and hopefully people will connect with the songs and recognize moments of their own life in them
2427344 thats why i wanted firesight to be the title of the record
2427345 its where i come from and its who i am
2427346 and i really needed to get uncomfortable and take a big risk it was nuts but i just felt as though it was something that i needed to do l a was completely alien to me i didnt know anyone when i moved there and i didnt make any friends there for about a year
2427347 i knew right away that this was what i was meant to be doing
2427348 i had been searching for my purpose and it smacked me in the face it was scary because i didnt know anyone in the music business but i knew that it was what i was supposed to do so i just went with it
2427349 when i started playing out in l a and finding myself as an artist it was the first time in my life that i actually felt like me
2427350 i could walk into a place and feel like all of me was there
2427351 and its great that it sprung up in l a yet had very little to do with the music business everyone was being offered record deals and turning them down we were just trying to figure out a way we could just have it be our own thing
2427352 listening to this record still sends a chill up my back
2427353 i think that most artists struggle with fear and insecurity and i certainly do but ive never felt more confident and comfortable on stage than when im playing the songs on
2427354 mom why didnt you let me be born a boy like i was supposed to be i dont wants a monthly
2427355 the landscapes presented here display a range of the u s soil painted by unknown individuals from the midwest to the southwest deserts
2427356 having painted the running family into someone elses landscape i illegally place a representation of the mexican into their utopia
2427357 give me one question im from the richmond hill liberal newspaper just give me the chance for one question
2427358 hey theyre people just like you and me they just have a great talent no need to be nervous
2427359 theres nothing to worry about the park is completely safe
2427360 it is a trap if anybody tried to protest at these parks they will be arrested
2427361 maybe they felt that with the opening ceremony happening it was not an appropriate time to protest
2427362 if you dont do that that emotion will continue to be pent up
2427363 the perfect opportunity would be before she speaks to have some opportunity for a celebration
2427364 were basically saying what do you want thats what the discussion is
2427365 we want to make sure that sen clintons supporters have the opportunity to express their enthusiasm for her when she speaks
2427366 my view is she should not put her name in nomination and she should just go tell her supporters lets suck it up this is a grown up game here
2427367 need to be given their due she lost by a smidgen
2427368 id be happy if theyd just give her the nomination but i know that cant happen
2427369 we should all be cautious with those kinds of allegations
2427370 the jury is not going to understand the case unless they understand the relationship
2427371 this is not irrelevant its going to be part of the case part of the proof
2427372 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2427373 im going to vote for obama but i want hillary to tell me why
2427374 for a while he was the enemy so i need a little help
2427375 we started on two separate paths but were on one journey now
2427376 like two sides of the same coin and that doesnt amount to a whole lot of change
2427377 shell have a huge effect on whether obama gets the support of her followers
2427378 her eyes were brighter she had bigger hand gestures it was more passionate before she was a little tepid
2427379 i know that we can come together if we keep having events like this
2427380 has earned a very large role in the future of the republican party
2427381 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2427382 i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2427383 russia should not be in the g 8 and by the way continued russian behavior indicates that russia is moving further and further from the principles and values and ideals of the g 8
2427384 i know by the way and you know that sen obama will give a great speech at their convention before 75 000 people in denver and i dont expect to match up to that and in the debates i expect him to do extremely well hes very very good
2427385 but i think its going to be substance that matters and i think its going to be vision for america and i think its going to be concrete plans of action but dont underestimate the challenges we face
2427386 theres no major challenge to having bowie in the apartment because he has several rooms to hang out in
2427387 he hangs in the dining room in his papasan chair he goes in the living room for the couch or for his bed or to be in front of the steam heater which he loves
2427388 knows how difficult it is to find apartments that rent to dogs
2427389 i once got a call from a guy up at buena vista park who saw the cat and called the number on his collar
2427390 i heard an interview on the radio once with the head of the spca in quebec or toronto and she said that its a myth that its cruel to have a dog in the city that most city dogs are better socialized exercised and stimulated than their country dog counterparts
2427391 when i looked at apartments i was shocked at how substandard my choices were given the price
2427392 for the number of dogs in the city the space is just too limited
2427393 one of the things i hear from my clients is how good their dogs life is
2427394 another person once said to me when i die i hope to come back as a dog in san francisco
2427395 to discriminate against any person in the terms conditions or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling or in the provision of services or facilities in connection with such dwelling because of a handicap
2427396 wait i have something in my garage you might like
2427397 i have admired your tomato plants for so many years
2427398 what is your secret with the tomatoes and the sunflowers
2427399 no no no its still early in the season ill wait until maybe you get a little tired of them later on and then ill take a few
2427400 sticks and stones may break our bones but names we mispell will never hurt us
2427401 ive worked a couple hundred cases and this is the first time ive worked with a man who claims hes innocent and the family of the victim of the crime
2427402 we all want the dna to talk to us the dna is telling a historical fact
2427403 were investigating the evidence to see what the evidence says
2427404 we believe there were at least three involved but there could have been more
2427405 weve got other suspects we believe were there we just dont have enough evidence to convict
2427406 if you were to install a gfci receptacle at the first outlet downstream from the distribution panel this will protect all receptacles downstream
2427407 you failed to outline the procedure that needs to be followed for downstream receptacles to be protected
2427408 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
2427409 i dont think hes going to be making a living in politics any time soon
2427410 the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown
2427411 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2427412 she is the finest human being i have ever known
2427413 i was trying to keep this mistake i had made from becoming public
2427414 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2427415 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2427416 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing nothing could be further from the truth
2427417 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2427418 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2427419 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2427420 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2427421 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2427422 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2427423 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2427424 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality
2427425 we advise students and their parents to be green and mindful when deciding what to bring do not come oversupplied there is not much space for storage or nonessentials

2427448 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2427449 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2427450 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2427451 the way they say these things happen it could be a lot worse i have heard about people who come back from this in a short period of time and others in a long period im hoping mine is short
2427452 his command was off a little bit but he competed and kept us in the ballgame overall i thought he threw the ball pretty good said sidewinders manager bill plummer
2427453 i felt like i got stronger and sharper as the game went on owings said
2427454 the first inning i was playing with some things mechanically
2427455 i fought through those first two innings once i got through those first two it felt like i got stronger as the game went on the last inning was probably my best overall
2427456 i went to turn up and i just couldnt do what i normally did
2427457 weve talked about a two quarterback system and we knew this would be coming not quite in this form but we knew we wanted to develop ronnie so this is a blessing in a sense and also allows us to give locker a little bit of rest
2427458 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2427459 fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
2427460 if in a month you are really really sick i will be really really happy
2427461 latest gt database of zip code with longitude and latitude
2427462 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2427463 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2427464 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2427465 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2427466 im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location im going to see my tutu my grandmother im going to watch my girls play on the beach
2427467 its that spirit that im convinced is what america is looking for right now
2427468 the national enquirer is not well regarded as a news source by the news media
2427469 we began pursuing the story soon after it first appeared but the standard for proof in this kind of intimate behavior is and should be very high
2427470 better to get it right even if we couldnt get it first
2427471 i think the mainstream news media were responsible for not airing it and not printing it earlier there really wasnt anything to report
2427472 if the story were false it would be a tremendously hurtful thing for his family and professionally lethal to him
2427473 for all those reasons and the fact that georgia has demonstrated that it is a close ally we cannot simply sit by and say so be it what does south ossetia mean to us
2427474 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension as they occur across georgia in regions far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia
2427475 we are asking our friends and the united states among them to somehow to try to mediate and try to persuade russia to stop this military aggression and invasion of georgia
2427476 i think its the meanest thing that could ever have happened to her
2427477 adding garbage to garbage i just dont understand how someone who professes to love somebody can do this
2427478 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2427479 you know what shes still really bright and i still have a lot of respect for her
2427480 my heart goes out to her she shouldnt have to deal with this after all she has been through from the loss of her son wade to her brave battle against cancer
2427481 i dont think its anyone elses business whats going on in their marriage
2427482 i feel for elizabeth edwards and i also feel that shes the only person allowed to make any judgment in this situation
2427483 just because there has been an affair doesnt mean you dont have a strong marriage
2427484 marriages survive infidelity when both decide to repair and forgive
2427485 oh yeah i think our marriage will not only survive it will be strong
2427486 she should not be involved in protecting me from whatever the consequences of this are
2427487 ok tell reporters its none of their business but dont lie
2427488 is he lying about the baby being his as well
2427489 this informs what cate will know about relationships with men
2427490 it informs how she will deal with her own relationships with men
2427491 what amazes me is that he doesnt see how this action is going to reverberate not only through his marriage now its going to touch his kids forever
2427492 what can i say i havent got the focus this week obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2427493 i think i need to spend 24 hours in bed
2427494 ive been fighting with my swing ive got the double miss going missing left and right i really need to figure out what im going to do with my long game
2427495 its not a complaint but theyre on the verge of dying
2427496 i wanted to try to get this thing behind me so i could focus more on the season
2427497 im glad that eagles president joe banner worked with my agent very well and they were able to get thing accomplished
2427498 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2427499 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2427500 i was doing a great job of trying to stay clean
2427501 my guys my offensive line came over and showered me with some grass
2427502 its depressing because our four guys in the shop put in so much work

2427505 id like to reward him im going to try as hard as i can but i have to restrain myself not take any of those crazy chances at least im running

2427515 a gift from brittany a memoir of love and loss in the french countryside
2427516 i didnt just read andrei makines dreams of my russian summers i devoured it the imagery was so beautiful haunting and sensual it drew me into a dreamlike world i didnt want to leave passage after passage held me in its grip long after finishing the book i read it years ago and although ive forgotten the words and much of the plot the remembrance of the intensity and magic of makines writing made it one of the most unforgettable books ive ever read i couldnt recommend it more highly
2427517 first of all its a brilliantly written book everyone wants to speak for soldiers but their point of view never gets spoken but it is so beautifully and powerfully written one of the great novels of the 20th century
2427518 im a christian and i think the bible is underread also a book on basic economics the richest man in babylon i always tell everyone to read it but never find anyone whos actually read it its about the basic economics of the human being how to save money build wealth it was written in the 30s and most of the books on wealth building were based on this book
2427519 its just stunning its one of the best collections of stories ever the gorgeousness of the language and depth of insight to the characters is incredible its top notch writing
2427520 critical what we can do about the health care crisis
2427521 its an incredible book about the time in history from 1958 to 1963 it should be mandatory reading for anyone trying to understand that period in our history
2427522 its a fabulous book about baseball and the vietnam war the writing is spectacular
2427523 there is guinness in the wet bar as you usually request angus would you like me to stop somewhere so you can get a bite to eat

2427528 to extend and expand the influence of psychiatry within the courtroom in a way that would challenge the authority of the legal profession
2427529 already past six oclock and still no sign of bobby
2427530 there seems to have been so little normal motivation the matter was so long planned so unfeelingly carried out that it represents nothing that i have ever seen or heard of before
2427531 because i always dreamed about getting into the nba that was my first and foremost goal i didnt have the olympic status as the top of my goal because as a little kid in my country you watch the nba all the time i set that as my ultimate goal
2427532 very versatile hes a stopper defensively he has length he can guard three positions at least on the court and hes a gamer he can make big shots when you need them
2427533 its going to be hard for coach k mike krzyzewski to play 12 guys but tayshauns a guy whos ready whenever hes called upon and he knows thats his role and hes a great teammate for all these guys
2427534 its kind of sad its scary we are in that type of hands
2427535 anytime you get on the international level youre going to feel some of that
2427536 if im called upon to fight the battle i will do that
2427537 if youre looking at europe they would love to see it
2427538 if i can bring anything i feel like its my mobility
2427539 maybe i can make some things happen on the ground and not just with my arm
2427540 in the sense that if they drop deep in coverage there might be an open lane to run and im going to take it
2427541 maybe then they cant drop back as much and that opens up passing lanes
2427542 im not sure he really knows what hes doing yet but he seems to get the ball to the right guy most of the time
2427543 i dont know if it is luck or the way its going
2427544 the big thing is he seems really calm theres yelling and screaming and bullets flying around and it doesnt seem to bother him at all
2427545 usually if we get four or five runs we typically win
2427546 im having a tough time right now but ill battle through it just like anybody else
2427547 zero tolerance policy against discrimination and harassment in the workplace
2427548 i hope all the countries watch and will learn from where i came from
2427549 that when we march in tonight we cant think of anyone better to carry our flag
2427550 we will see how they react against a good team that throws the football
2427551 we have had good physical contact im pleased with our progress
2427552 in scrimmages you start to build some continuity and confidence on both sides of the ball i want a clean scrimmage protect the football no foolish penalties things like that
2427553 for the thrill of it leopold loeb and the murder that shocked chicago
2427554 its interesting this case has persisted in our memory when there have been other crimes that were more violent more perverse and more notorious
2427555 people who grew up in chicago in the fifties frequently mention the schuessler peterson murders as an experience that marked a loss of innocence
2427556 the idea that three boys could be randomly abducted and murdered shook peoples confidence in the society they lived in
2427557 i think its that the murder was purely random purely done for the sensation of committing the crime and in pursuing that sensation they committed an act beyond any moral code
2427558 the enduring puzzle of the case is that you have two amazingly educated individuals who were wealthy who could have had anything they wanted just for the asking they were not mentally defective and yet they did something that goes far beyond the pale of sound behavior
2427559 i couldnt give a motive which makes sense to me
2427560 it was the act of a child a simpleton kid
2427561 after all ive read and studied about the case i still couldnt tell you why they did it
2427562 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2427563 buka rekening dengan setoran awal saja lalu luangkan waktu 15 20 menit saja
2427564 well be ok there are good football players on this team were ok
2427565 were asking them to think a lot theyve got a lot of different assignments but ultimately they gotta be physical and theyve gotta be willing play men and not gaps and really command double teams and try to hold their own
2427566 he was running with the ones and he had a lot of improvement talking to the coaches you could see that he was going to be a great guy to help us out
2427567 he s a veteran and a smart guy he had a great the first couple days of practice we decided to rest him the last three days he s going to be fine
2427568 im excited as heck he earned his way with the 1s and he had another good day
2427569 the advertising model has made internet content and services available to millions of people in the united states and around the world for free
2427570 customized advertising gives users a better experience and helps them save time and money
2427571 the opportunity to support content that otherwise would not be supported with mass media economics
2427572 the growing trend of companies tailoring internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
2427573 yahoos argument that without digital data collection there would be an absence of free editorial content online is disingenuous and self serving
2427574 theyve always been a pretty respectful team no ones punched anyone out nothing violent
2427575 we always wave and smile at each other you couldnt tell that were rivals
2427576 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2427577 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2427578 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2427579 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2427580 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leader board and feeling the good vibes
2427581 he was larger than life a father figure to so many and one of the last legends in the entertainment business
2427582 he believed in what youre doing and helped give you confidence but he also was really smart about show business even the most fundamental stuff
2427583 even though what i was doing on saturday night live was more rock n roll and different generation and different sensitivity than mr brillstein was used to at the core he knew about audience and talent and how to put on a show he loved show business and he was unabashed in how much he loved it
2427584 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2427585 and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2427586 bernie was an icon and one of the most successful talent managers in the business
2427587 he was a father to me and he was my mentor and my partner and the godfather of my eldest son and im going to miss him every day for the rest of my life
2427588 truly loved show business which is extraordinary in this day and age
2427589 he worked with me every day until i left to become chairman of chicago aviation boss resigns over generator delivery from comed to his home

2427591 you do not have to stop living your life as you live it
2427592 he had all kinds of interesting items but the buttons were his favorite
2427593 he knew that long before there were television ads radio spots or internet blogs presidential elections were sometimes sewn up with a simple but memorable button
2427594 bob was one of the top collectors in the country of campaign buttons particularly those from the eisenhower stevenson era
2427595 but more importantly he was a man of integrity he was the consummate gentleman
2427596 shortly after we were married i was dusting off his dresser and picked up a mound of what i thought were just ordinary buttons from the last presidential election
2427597 bob brought his professors inquisitive mind to everything he did
2427598 he always wanted to know as much as he could about everything he collected
2427599 what made it so much fun for him was that he really enjoyed learning about the history surrounding presidential politics

2427606 you can always tell a tourist on the tram because theyre the ones using the straps
2427607 the word straphanger probably developed around the turn of the 20th century
2427608 i think they removed the straps in my lifetime maybe in the 1960s
2427609 we debated whether to change our name from the straphangers to the barhangers
2427610 some of our cars feature canvas straps which most closely replicate the original straphangers experience

2427616 one of the benefits of the eagle cash card is soldiers can use it at any army and air force exchange service facility
2427617 the ecc is easier for soldiers to maintain and keep track of than cash
2427618 it also makes it easier for the soldiers commander its their job to lead the unit but also keep track of soldiers expenses
2427619 we definitely encourage all soldiers to participate in the savings deposit program
2427620 the sdp is an investment fund with a fixed rate 10 percent annual interest

2427622 the only thing valuable today is yours and mine attention people pay a lot of money to get attention to themselves to their web sites and so on actually i was at insead when we did a very interesting experiment where we showed that people were willing to pay money in exchange of attention from a group that would applaud at them
2427623 if youre going to write a review of something and people have already reviewed it 75 times why bother writing another review unless you disagree with the prevailing view which is very different from the way we go to public discourse where everybody are giving opinions at the same time
2427624 we are going to start discovering that even though the web will make us available to the world the fact is we interact with very few people most of the time so the interactions are becoming more intimate facebook is a phenomenon that eventually people will tire off
2427625 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2427626 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly

2427635 for 34 years we were partners lovers friends and all of sudden i am living with a monster
2427636 knowing that plaque occurs quickly implies that something initiates it
2427637 apparently i reacted to this situation in a reasonably typical way with a sense of loss and abandonment with an incoherent or perhaps i should say violently coherent fury that made the miltonic lucifers rage against heaven seem a bit miffed by comparison
2427638 it seems pretty obvious to me that if youre out meeting people breathing in lungfuls of fresh air getting your blood coursing around your body youre going to be a lot better prepared to deal with something like alzheimers than if you just stay at home watching tv and moping

2427643 this is not acceptable to the jain point of view
2427644 why does cote divoire have 76 religions while norway has 13 and why does brazil have 159 religions while canada has 15 even though in both comparisons the countries are similar in size
2427645 if this argument is correct then across the globe religion diversity should correlate positively with infectious disease diversity
2427646 a sample of traditional societies shows that the range of those societies is lower in areas with more disease agents compared with areas with few pathogens and in countries religion diversity is positively related to two measures of stress caused by infection with parasites religion richness was positively related to disease richness and significantly so
2427647 we found that religion diversity is the highest where disease diversity is also the highest and the lowest where disease diversity is also the lowest to our knowledge previous evolutionary models do not offer an explanation for why religion diversity varies spatially across the globe
2427648 our analysis suggests that the nature of religion needs to be reconsidered although religion apparently is for establishing a social marker of group alliance and allegiance at the most fundamental level it may be for the avoidance and management of infectious disease
2427649 we just killed a guy what do we tell the family
2427650 greater than you would expect in the general population in that age group
2427651 that rubble needs to go and lets put some grass there
2427652 he said its nothing too serious he reckons the attacker was drunk
2427653 the hotel is highly embarrassed a complaint has been lodged and they are doing a sweep of the area
2427654 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2427655 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2427656 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2427657 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them
2427658 according to the selected literature the relative genetic risk calculated from your genotype for males of european ancestry is 0 90
2427659 this corresponds to a 44 2 lifetime risk of developing heart attack which is 10 less than for males of european ancestry in general
2427660 it is a new form of diagnosis before any symptoms manifest themselves but really what everybody should do is smoke less eat less and do more exercise
2427661 the results could allow people to make changes for the better to their lifestyle
2427662 however if they misinterpret them the scans could do more harm than good and could actually reduce peoples autonomy if they interpret the results incorrectly or exaggerate their implications
2427663 the people who feel that they want to go over the results with a doctor should go to a doctor
2427664 when i got mine i went into the office and closed the door i wanted to be alone
2427665 it should be your decision we are not ramming it down anyones throat how you use it depends on who you are but you are entitled to make the choice of getting the information or not getting it
2427666 but you can get so much out of it it could be extremely beneficial to know that you are at a higher risk
2427667 im afraid to tell you that you are just an average guy
2427668 i am overwhelmed by the outcome and its marvellous to know that the long journey ive been on has finally come to an end
2427669 im so happy to know that no one else will go through what me and my family have gone through and no other pupil will ever get banned from wearing their kara again
2427670 i just want to say that i am a proud welsh and punjabi sikh girl
2427671 we are over the moon it is just such a relief
2427672 we are very pleased with the outcome of the case but we are extremely disappointed that we had to come to the high court in the order to give our daughter the right to wear the kara in school
2427673 in this case there is very clear evidence it was not a piece of jewellery but to sarika was and remains one of the defining focal symbols of being a sikh
2427674 it was not taken lightly we regret that this action became at all necessary
2427675 we note the comments of the judge regarding the advice offered to the school
2427676 should sarika wish to return to school in september in accordance with the judgment she will be offered help and support to reintegrate her into the normal day to day life of the school
2427677 its a shame that each generation has to fight the same battles this battle was already fought 25 years ago and sarika shouldnt have had to go through that again
2427678 our great british traditions of religious tolerance and race equality have been rightly upheld today
2427679 be working with the schools governing body to ensure sarika singhs continued education
2427680 the realm of the state to the realm of belief
2427681 believe whatever nonsense you want but keep it to yourself and act responsibly
2427682 believe what we want you to believe and act as we say
2427683 believe what we want you to believe and act as we say or we will kill you
2427684 i always have that fear what if hes not liked or if someones mean to him
2427685 i think you have to remind yourself that children are very perceptive and they are going to pick up on how you handle a situation
2427686 its important to be able to talk to yourself and get yourself calmed down
2427687 kids are often more resilient than we give them credit for
2427688 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2427689 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2427690 excluded your client as a subject or target of the investigation
2427691 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2427692 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms
2427693 significant numbers appear to hold beliefs which contravene democratic values
2427694 these results are deeply embarrassing for those who have said there is no extremism in british universities
2427695 the finding that a large number of students think it is okay to kill in the name of religion is alarming
2427696 there is a wide cultural divide between muslim and nonmuslim students the solution is to stop talking about celebrating diversity and focus on integration and assimilation
2427697 our researchers found a ghettoised mentality among muslim students at queen mary also we found the segregation between muslim men and women at events more visible at queen mary
2427698 clearly we in no way associate ourselves with these views however also integral to the spirit of university life is free speech and debate and on occasion speakers will make statements that are deemed offensive
2427699 this disgusting report is a reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain
2427700 only 632 muslim students were asked vague and misleading questions and their answers were wilfully misinterpreted
2427701 violence or the incitement to violence has no place on a university campus
2427702 taken immense pains to devise a uniform policy which respected muslim beliefs
2427703 occult practices atheistic views voodoo rituals or any other form of mysticism
2427704 it is discriminatory not only against atheists but they also are banning access to sites to do with witchcraft
2427705 witchcraft these days is called wicca which is an actual legitimate and recognised religion
2427706 we feel very strongly that people who dont believe should not be denied the access that people who do believe have got
2427707 we are currently implementing new internet monitoring software to make the control of internet access easier to manage
2427708 the aim of this is to provide greater control for individual line managers to monitor internet usage and for departments such as trading standards and child protection to gain access if needed to certain sites for business reasons
2427709 i dont think the show is about being the best dancer
2427710 its almost becoming like a novel at this point like this generations a tale of two cities or oliver twist
2427711 he added that some opinion polls said that up to 25 of the uk population now considered themselves atheist
2427712 being an ignorant primitive that thinks his beliefs actually map onto reality without evidence without proof without logic just because he feels like it should
2427713 id much rather believe in the idea of an omnipotent being that is eternal
2427714 the band is dealing with some internal issues at the moment
2427715 they just could not find a harmonious way to work together and that has lead to the decisions announced today
2427716 hi there this is the full release of the epbt that covers
2427717 if you could please update this it would be awesome
2427718 como tener la mejor vista de hotel todo el tiempo
2427719 the way they say these things happen it could be a lot worse i have heard about people who come back from this in a short period of time and others in a long period im hoping mine is short
2427720 i went to turn up and i just couldnt do what i normally did
2427721 weve talked about a two quarterback system and we knew this would be coming not quite in this form but we knew we wanted to develop ronnie so this is a blessing in a sense and also allows us to give locker a little bit of rest
2427722 if i can bring anything i feel like its my mobility
2427723 maybe i can make some things happen on the ground and not just with my arm
2427724 in the sense that if they drop deep in coverage there might be an open lane to run and im going to take it
2427725 maybe then they cant drop back as much and that opens up passing lanes
2427726 im not sure he really knows what hes doing yet but he seems to get the ball to the right guy most of the time
2427727 i dont know if it is luck or the way its going
2427728 the big thing is he seems really calm theres yelling and screaming and bullets flying around and it doesnt seem to bother him at all
2427729 its kind of sad its scary we are in that type of hands
2427730 anytime you get on the international level youre going to feel some of that
2427731 if im called upon to fight the battle i will do that
2427732 if youre looking at europe they would love to see it
2427733 we will see how they react against a good team that throws the football
2427734 we have had good physical contact im pleased with our progress
2427735 in scrimmages you start to build some continuity and confidence on both sides of the ball i want a clean scrimmage protect the football no foolish penalties things like that
2427736 we will see how they react against a good team that throws the football
2427737 we have had good physical contact im pleased with our progress
2427738 in scrimmages you start to build some continuity and confidence on both sides of the ball i want a clean scrimmage protect the football no foolish penalties things like that
2427739 but hes a pretty resilient kid obviously hes quite disappointed himself but hes got a lot of good options out there
2427740 mis hermanos saben c mo funciona mi equipo saben en qu consiste c mo se arma c mo se desarma c mo debemos subir a la monta a a las sillas qu hacer en caso de emergencia o qu hacer cuando un ski se zafa ellos van conmigo porque saben todo lo relacionado a mi deporte hemos hecho un equipo y estamos juntos desde el principio para esta aventura
2427741 it was a unique opportunity to explain israels position first hand
2427742 we have good relations with u s and several students go to pursue higher studies
2427743 sam and lindsay are unbelievably happy and in a healthy relationship
2427744 and like any couple in love they speak about marriage and the future but right now there is no wedding planned
2427745 thisll all be fulfilled in 70 a d but shhh dont tell anyone
2427746 maybe the evidence is there and we just havent found it yet
2427747 however all of those who said this without exception that ive seen thought nero would rise again and come back as a future
2427748 im wondering if your authors borrowed that from mormon apologists re archeology in north america
2427749 it is fitting to add to his accounts the true prediction of our saviour in which he foretold these very events
2427750 if any one compares the words of our saviour with the other accounts of the historian concerning the whole war how can one fail to wonder and to admit that the foreknowledge and the prophecy of our saviour were truly divine and marvelously strange
2427751 prophesying concerning the temple he said see ye these buildings verily i say to you there shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be taken away matt 24 3 and this generation shall not pass until the destruction begin matt 24 34 and in like manner he spoke in plain words the things that were straightway to happen which we can now see with our eyes in order that the accomplishment might be among those to whom the word was spoken
2427752 the half of the week nero held sway and in the holy city jerusalem placed the abomination and in the half of the week he was taken away and otho and galba and vitellius and vespasian rose to the supreme power and destroyed jerusalem and desolated the holy place
2427753 and thus in the day of their storming the jews fulfilled the seventy hebdomads predicted in daniel
2427754 there are not wanting those who apply this passage to the siege and destruction of jerusalem by titus
2427755 these things are referred by some to those sufferings which were inflicted by the romans upon the jews
2427756 the earliest systematic exposition of the book in the greek church
2427757 to unfold the meaning of the apocalypse and to make the suitable application of its predictions to the times that followed it
2427758 no mere reproduction of the work of his predecessor although it incorporates a large portion of the contents of that work
2427759 the king will do as he pleases he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard of things against the god of gods he will be successful until the time of wrath is completed for what has been determined must take place he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired by women nor will he regard any god but will exalt himself above them all
2427760 his armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation
2427761 was anyone called while circumcised let him not become uncircumcised was anyone called while uncircumcised let him not be circumcised
2427762 for it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins
2427763 so when you see standing in the holy place the abomination that causes desolation spoken of through the prophet daniel let the reader understand
2427764 but to say that daniels prediction was completely fulfilled by antiochus is fallacious
2427765 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2427766 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2427767 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2427768 everything has changed since katrina even our neighborhoods arent familiar anymore
2427769 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2427770 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2427771 in the city youre just going from curb to curb
2427772 on the college campus theres so many zigzags so many decisions to make id stop and ask sighted people and theyd be as lost as i was
2427773 the first day hed been to the dormitory twice and that was it he already knew where it was
2427774 i cant go to a movie at 5 if the dog needs to eat at 6
2427775 what fascinates people is that guide dogs are so well behaved in public
2427776 what im seeing now with the food their work is so consistent the dogs understand their job
2427777 the dogs confidence explodes during that part of the training
2427778 i take a daily pill which means i can live a more or less normal life i just think they have got it wrong about sutent
2427779 i have had five star treatment from the nhs since i was diagnosed five years ago
2427780 they have done everything they could to keep me alive it seems a shame to throw in the towel now
2427781 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2427782 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2427783 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2427784 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2427785 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2427786 georg stub ordf rer her kommer bilde og personalia om v r nye ordf rer georg stub han ble valgt til ordf rer i ski kommune p kommunestyrem te den 17 oktober

2427788 n o cederam uma s posi o e continuam tomando novas
2427789 when it comes to the young people from abels part of town we tend to only hear about the kids sucked into lives of violence and crime
2427790 abel was a man who rejected the conventional wisdom and defied the odds he turned away from the destructive forces entrenched in his community and refused to give in to the elements of hate and division
2427791 true example of everything we could wish for in a public servant
2427792 his little boy was excited because they were planning to leave that weekend to san francisco
2427793 he was a very smart child a very active child
2427794 you could tell from a young age he wanted to give back to the community
2427795 what a shame to lose someone so special and with so many values
2427796 you felt as if the air was being vacuumed out of the cathedral
2427797 i said in order for the bill to pass the senate it is going to have to contain the green line extension
2427798 understood that they are playing a game of chicken and blaming the legislature i am praying to god they do the right thing i dont want to see this thing go down either
2427799 i have been trying to find out from someone why they object to having this particular project in the bill and no one has given me an answer
2427800 now they are claiming it is too late because of the timing with the ballot to effectuate a change in the ordinance
2427801 we have documentation to show thats not true we know its not impossible yes they would have to convene another meeting but they could do it
2427802 the transportation wheels have moved way too slowly in the county of los angeles and a lot of it has to do with these politics
2427803 a word to the wise aint necessary its the stupid ones who need the advice
2427804 the agreement between scala and statoilhydro finalizes an effort to develop a digital petrol station network through the scandinavian and baltic countries
2427805 we choose scala because we were looking for a software provider that had experience in larger networks it was important for us to choose a thoroughly tested and established software platform that provided a variety of content possibilities
2427806 because weather has such high audience interest accuweather com content brings more attention to screens and that means that more eyeballs see our customers advertisements
2427807 we see this endeavour as part of our expanding digital network in which advertisers use our weather and news content to increase ad impact and ultimately their revenue
2427808 our integration with accuweather com will make a high quality plug and play content source accessible to all of our client networks thus giving them more options to create programs that are relevant to viewers
2427809 i anticipate that accuweather coms feeds will be widely used across all vertical markets we are serving from grocery stores to gas stations waiting rooms to plazas taxicabs subways airports buses universities and corporate lobbies
2427810 zo boeken we ook huwelijken af waarbij veertienjarigen ingeschreven staan een man met twee echtgenotes mag nou eenmaal van de wet niet voorkomen we gaan nu onderzoeken of we iets over het hoofd hebben gezien en of er mogelijk sprake is van een nog niet onderkende trend want als die er is hoort het tot onze taak om dat te melden
2427811 wij schrijven die in op basis van de wet conflictrechten huwelijk die polygame huwelijken worden gewoon erkend voor ons is van belang of de documenten authentiek zijn n of de echtgenoot geen nederlander is al dan niet met dubbele nationaliteit ook dan mag het niet
2427812 maar in de praktijk komt het nauwelijks voor dat een bigame of polygame registratie wordt geweigerd
2427813 i keep getting stuff about these songs are about these terrible things that happened
2427814 but i dont know if my life is any darker than anyone elses i really just think that theres something about catharsis and taking some of your worst moments and trying to find the beauty in them theres almost a defiance in that
2427815 and then when my mom got sick i got sick my dads terminally ill i think i just like snapped one day i picked up a guitar and started playing and then it was eight hours a day for a year
2427816 fitzgerald is talking to his mentor who says the only difference between leading a scholastic life where you write it down and a non scholastic life is that if you lead a scholastic life you leave a record
2427817 i always loved it when you take something really clean and proper sounding
2427818 and every single clich about the record industry is true people offering you drugs telling you how famous they can make you how much you need them in order for it to happen how if you dont do x y and z its not gonna happen
2427819 its kind of a myth that you need a big studio and all that stuff now
2427820 technology is such that you can get some really amazing sounds our studio wasnt exactly what youd call a home studio but it was in a home
2427821 it takes away one of the barriers to recording stuff suddenly you have all these artists who would never have an audience who have an audience people say the record industry is crumbling its not indie rock is thriving
2427822 right now i should have my second novel and a 1 year old kid
2427823 low res is cool in the same way that hd is cool its about the way its used hd isnt so wonderful on its own
2427824 the image itself is so crystal clear it can disguise the fact that the elements around it are not so great
2427825 those pixels in cell phone video are nice they can have a really beautiful kaleidoscope effect
2427826 the luminosity of the screen and the blue light make it seem like its always late at night also the person in it is always alone
2427827 even if its a party scene its really about the person in front
2427828 we got a submission that was a guy jumping out of a plane
2427829 even though it has a red light they dont know its on
2427830 theres a richness to it because its normally used for still images
2427831 there used to be two different lenses for still and video
2427832 were seeing the beginning of hd video in point and shoot cameras cell phone video will become like pixelvision but therell be literally hundreds of devices itll be a playground for filmmakers
2427833 i watch passengers struggle to get off the bus and not fall into the wells even though a warning sign is leaning up against the tree this is dangerous and one of these days one of us is going to fall and break an ankle trying to get on or off the ac transit bus i dont understand why it has been months and months since this situation was created
2427834 this can totally shift the political dynamic of the board
2427835 theres going to be a tough fight from now until november
2427836 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2427837 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2427838 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2427839 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2427840 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2427841 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2427842 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2427843 springdale arkansas august 8 2008 tyson foods inc announced today it has reached a new agreement with the retail wholesale and department store union rwdsu an american union reinstating labor day as one of the designated paid holidays under the contract for covered employees in the shelbyville tennessee plant tyson made this request on behalf of its shelbyville plant employees some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so the union membership voted overwhelmingly thursday to reinstate labor day as one of the plants paid holidays while keeping eid al fitr as an additional paid holiday for this year only this means that in 2008 only shelbyville employees will have nine paid holidays for the remainder of the five year contract period the eight paid holidays will include new years day martin luther king day memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day christmas day and a personal holiday which could either be the employees birthday eid al fitr or another day requested and approved by their supervisor this issue concerns only the plant at shelbyville tennessee labor day has always been celebrated and continues to be at the other 118 tyson plants across the country the shelbyville complex employs approximately 1 200 people approximately 1 000 workers are covered by the rwdsu union agreement at that location
2427844 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2427845 dude you want asians to give you a dollar to buy a tree to plant in the fucking amazon when theres a rice shortage in silicon valley
2427846 i swear nothing happened thats my story and im sticking to it
2427847 and finally one correction on the panel yesterday i said that weve worked for the nra thats not true a colleague of mine was a senior communications person at the nra but theyre not a client of ours i had a mental glitch yesterday and wanted to correct the record
2427848 david chius letter was straightforward and clear he has a clearly progressive record and a candidate for d3 that i have no hesitation in supporting
2427849 and do you really want to call me out about the organization i work for
2427850 our tools can be used equally by the national rifle association as by handgun control
2427851 we do not work with the rnc or nra right now
2427852 while many of our clients names must remain confidential including some really really cool ones weve included a partial list of current and past clients
2427853 i am also the strongest district 3 candidate to advance our values and stand up to special interest groups who are planning to spend millions to defeat the causes we care about the most
2427854 i was endorsed by groups such as the harvey milk club san francisco labor council san francisco tenants union san francisco womens political committee san francisco acorn san francisco bay guardian the sierra club san francisco young democrats and san francisco league of conservation voters
2427855 when you dig just beneath the surface of browns slander you see there is no evidence at all
2427856 vision that new online technologies could radically empower individuals from all backgrounds to organize vibrant grassroots constituencies
2427857 despite the bipartisan nature of our company the overwhelming majority of our political clients serve progressive and democratic interests
2427858 these political attacks attempt to impugn my record by selectively highlighting the pre grassroots employment biographies of two individuals affiliated with grassroots washington dc office these two individuals had previously worked with the christian coalition and the national rifle association two organizations with which i have always vehemently disagreed
2427859 since the majority of grassroots employees are politically left the board of directors of grassroots enterprise brought on these two individuals to add political diversity to grassroots washington dc office the companys headquarters this is the common practice of companies in washington dc and throughout the country
2427860 contrary to h browns wild accusations grassroots has never licensed its technology to the christian coalition alliance defense fund the national rifle association or any comparable anti gay christian conservative or pro gun organizations
2427861 my own professional work while at grassroots has only been with democratic and progressive clients
2427862 given the facts i hope you will judge my long standing track record accurately and compare it with other candidates in the district 3 race
2427863 based on my actual record assemblyman mark leno supervisor aaron peskin supervisor tom ammiano supervisor chris daly supervisor ross mirkarimi district attorney kamala harris public defender jeff adachi school board members eric mar and jane kim and many other citywide and district 3 leaders have endorsed me for district 3 supervisor
2427864 is it strange that david chiu is the number one person that is attacked constantly there has to be a reason for it
2427865 its sufficient to say something may have occurred in that area at that time
2427866 but were not necessarily restricting our investigation to that time
2427867 c program files openoffice org 2 4 program soffice bin
2427868 i was feeling very rusty early if you saw the first couple of swings
2427869 thats to be expected after going 15 days and not seeing a pitch but it came back quickly
2427870 usually if we get four or five runs we typically win
2427871 all in all it was kind of ugly in the first inning im human i cant go out there and put up zeros inning after inning
2427872 at the linuxworld expo an analyst for the 451 group pointed to a growing trend in enterprise the
2427873 weve had no luck so far and no leads at all
2427874 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2427875 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2427876 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2427877 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2427878 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2427879 if this guy will work for free ive simply got to convince him work at my organization is fun and greatly benefits society and then maybe i can low ball him into working 60 hours a week for 40k a year
2427880 requires 1 or more years of experience in this field
2427881 he wasnt as sharp as he could be but i think thats just because he was probably a little rusty it looked like he had an easy time throwing the ball his velocity varied somewhat but it didnt look like he was forcing anything
2427882 i was trying to throw strikes and trying to stay ahead in the count
2427883 its nice to help the team it feels good to be back its what they pay me for so its nice for me to get a decision
2427884 he wanted to test out his fastball and establish his aggressiveness in the strike zone
2427885 it was something he needed to do and he just really tried to establish and throw strikes in the strike zone i thought he did a fairly good job today
2427886 i wanted to make a perfect routine but something went wrong
2427887 its very much a disappointment its one of the worst games in the time im doing gymnastics

2427891 those pixels in cell phone video are nice they can have a really beautiful kaleidoscope effect
2427892 the luminosity of the screen and the blue light make it seem like its always late at night also the person in it is always alone

2427900 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2427901 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2427902 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
2427903 but i think they are even more skillful than belgium
2427904 they play very well on balls crossed into the area we will have to be careful
2427905 but how do you build community around it youtube is great but you have to get through a bunch of junk before you see something really good we want people to think it about it first and then share

2427907 nothing is bigger than this its going to be one hell of a night
2427908 its not everyday you get to play brazil and the names that roll off their team sheet
2427909 first and foremost we are concentrating on getting a decent result but we dont want to look too far ahead its not a case of putting all our eggs in the belgium basket
2427910 its just not in our make up to write this game off and it would be a disservice to the players to do so
2427911 if we just try and hold them at bay i think we are going to get trounced
2427912 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet

2427915 i was a little bit stressed and nervous in the competition thats why i didnt perform better
2427916 i only had 20 to 30 training days and i had injuries so i could be better
2427917 i had the special support from the chinese audience and therefore i dont think i was under great pressure

2427981 the lobster industry had concerns that banning midwater trawl gear could negatively impact bait supply however we found that the purse seine fleet was very capable of providing a steady supply of bait over the course of the fishing season in fact when the midwater trawl ban was lifted the remainder of the herring quota was immediately caught flooding the market with bait this experience has given us confidence that purse seine gear is not only better for the herring resource and ecosystem but it also avoids the potential bait shortages during the peak fall lobster fishing season
2427982 but as soon as the large herring trawlers began showing up in the early nineties things took a nosedive

2428004 i was fighting a good fighter and in the last two rounds i got my rhythm but i still wasnt at my best
2428005 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2428006 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2428007 yahoo understands that the trust of our users is our greatest asset
2428008 this is extremely dramatic and broad based a remarkable downturn all across the commodities

2428011 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
2428012 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2428013 and as such we rallied around each other for support

2428022 twenty years ago i wanted to feed the birds in my back yard i went to a store that sold bird feeders and found that most of the feeders were ugly plastic tubes
2428023 i thought wouldnt it be beautiful if a bird could land and feed on something as colorful and beautiful as the bird
2428024 on that basis one friend asked me to join her at a craft fair she was attending so i made 40 more feeders all unique i sold them all within the first two hours at the fair
2428025 a vast network of friends who collect stuff for me often ill wake up and find a bag of copper plates and whatnot on my front porch
2428026 most of the parts that go into these feeders were not attractive in their original form
2428027 i make sure i use high quality seed from a bird supply store

2428173 at a technical level the problem were really addressing is that there are no existing tools that make detection and examination of modified traffic easy and automatic eckersley told me via email
2428174 there have been some tools released that detect specific kinds of interference such as modified web pages or tcp rst spoofing but nothing that spots arbitrary modifications
2428175 the word throttling has been used to describe the network management undertaken by isps such as comcast and cox against various programs including p2p apps like bittorrent and gnutella limewire
2428176 but throttling isnt a very accurate description of what comcast and cox were doing because it suggests that the isp was just slowing down or shaping the traffic what we saw with u s cable isps was not just the slowing of some communications but the actual injection of forged packets

2428180 country was a huge part of what i listened to
2428181 all of my boyfriends growing up all of our songs were from garth brooks or clint black or clay walker
2428182 he would play me old patsy cline stuff and johnny cash and i just really started to understand the storytelling of country music
2428183 i was just at a place in my life when i should not have been on stage
2428184 to mess up in front of the president and steven spielberg and dolly parton and all these people its pretty much one of my all time lows
2428185 i had told my dad i never want to sing again dont even try to encourage me to sing again its just not what im supposed to be doing dolly caught wind of it and she told me that i have one of her favorite voices out there and that if i didnt keep singing that it would just be a shame and if i ever needed her help at all to give her a call
2428186 its amazing how things can come full circle like your lowest of lows can end up making something your highest of high
2428187 theres nothing wrong with simpsons performance that a head transplant wouldnt cure

2428204 mobile texters in the united states sent 158 billion messages last year 2006 up 95 percent from 2005 according to industry statistics
2428205 people who use cell phones while behind the wheel impede the flow of traffic clog highways and extend commute times
2428206 delays in traffic streams of very small amounts grow into massive numbers when you project it across a highway and across a nation
2428207 ten times more likely to leave their lane than regular drivers

2428216 existe uma id ia de que a moda n o uma forma de arte ou uma forma cultural mas sim uma modalidade de vaidade e consumismo
2428217 e h uma expectativa de que essas dimens es da cultura sejam alvo de zombaria por parte das pessoas s rias e inteligentes
2428218 especialmente no universo acad mico onde os corpos s o apenas ve culos para o transporte de c rebros a emo o a agita o social e a dissimula o complexa do mundo da moda s o bastante denegridas o vestu rio padr o do meio acad mico apresenta algumas varia es mas basicamente o objetivo dele transmitir a impress o de que a pessoa n o est prestando aten o na moda que n o f til e que n o est de forma alguma interessada nesse tipo de coisa
2428219 fiquei surpresa em constatar o grau de hostilidade dirigido a mim
2428220 os intelectuais achavam que aquilo era algo repulsivo desprez vel completamente v o e f til

2428234 there is little doubt that iran has been the chief beneficiary of the war on terror in the middle east

2428274 documentary making continues to flourish every year there are more films that command the big screen says documentary and mavericks programmer thom powers
2428275 heavy marijuana use particularly in adolescence appears to be associated with an increased risk for the later development of schizophrenia and the course of illness is worse for people with schizophrenia who use marijuana
2428276 one of the things they look at is non stops
2428277 thats the scorecard that site consultants and major companies look for
2428278 the airlines for the most part are trying to keep as much service as they can at their hubs
2428279 that second tier of cities that tend to have smaller populations and not have an airline hub theyre at risk of losing service
2428280 the straw that broke the camels back the key factor was superior airline service at dallas fort worth
2428281 its something that our clients look at on a constant basis
2428282 losing the nonstops to colorado springs and spokane therell be three people in town wholl notice
2428283 i think were going to gain those back at some time in the future
2428284 its a lot of work a lot of adventure no pay
2428285 weve taken on a few temporarily some who had tall ship experience but others had other commitments
2428286 my son said what do you mean youre going on a tall ship
2428287 its quite sensational it brings back all the memories of the books you read
2428288 weve had everyone from homeless people to cooks and a lot of college students
2428289 everything is muscle power and shes a square rigger everythings downwind
2428290 a lot of people with motion sickness tend to find that this is not the place for them this thing bobs like a cork
2428291 the quality of the product and some of the innovations weve worked on make us confident to offer local google com
2428292 its really the structured data thats the key to the whole thing
2428293 in the absence of the structured data theyd be hard pressed to present a quality local search user experience
2428294 we certainly have plans for that in the very near future
2428295 if im a local business i want to be in these listings and as of right now i have no idea how to make that happen
2428296 because information is exploding is going to become increasingly difficult to use if we dont get it right
2428297 its like going to a library and only pulling one book off the shelf
2428298 at the moment when you search on google everyone gets the same results for the same keywords
2428299 people dont want to be spending time searching and looking for things
2428300 they want to be spending the time analyzing the information
2428301 we still have this library metaphor of let me give you back a bunch of books that might help you rather than let me go through the books for you and figure out what youre looking for
2428302 it will be something that we havent even thought of yet
2428303 if john c dvorak writes for magazines what are they where are they and does he have a phone number i can call
2428304 search engines like google msn and yahoo can drive a lot of traffic to a web site it is important that a webmaster or seo expert knows what kind of search phrases they have to use to drive more traffic to a site our software is the ultimate solution to measure search phrases and search phrases by search engine each webmaster or seo expert can analyse what kind of search engines the visitors use to find a web site
2428305 were constantly evaluating the right way to design the product
2428306 for the map our goal is comprehensiveness over time as we think it adds value to consumers wed consider doing it
2428307 thats dangerous territory for them because they want to offer the best user experience they can
2428308 theres a way that can be done in an effective but restrained manner
2428309 being able to search e mail quickly and easily is an important thing said page who has used the service for his personal e mail for months
2428310 finding nemo for example might elicit ads from disney studios or amazon com which sells the dvd version of the movie
2428311 maybe people will say hey stay out of my e mail said gary stein analyst for jupiter research
2428312 but it might also mean that two people are trading messages about mountain bike riding and they get useful ads related to that
2428313 machines not humans will scan e mail messages for ad placement and the company is not worried about privacy breaches
2428314 this is a good way for us to make money and its also un intrusive page said
2428315 the clicks that this generates will be good eventually for advertisers
2428316 the feeling the sense the common thinking is that they have to do more than search stein said
2428317 the peril is they lose their uniqueness and become more like a portal google is sort of a unique thing in the world
2428318 this product fits pretty squarely into that mission page said
2428319 its very similar in that its a large hosted business that requires a lot of servers
2428320 theres been a lot of pains taken to make it work quickly page said
2428321 country was a huge part of what i listened to

2428332 this one i think is going to be bigger and more spectacular not necessarily more surprising but more impressive i think than any previous ceremony
2428333 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2428334 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2428335 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
2428336 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
2428337 je respectais bien mon contrats cest a dire etre vraiment en cr eation dentreprise
2428338 there will undoubtedly be some folks that will see this and freak out

2428424 the government promises to take decisive action in implementing the agreements you reached the somalia national reconciliation conference is officially closed but we will continue with reconciliation until peace is achieved
2428425 the somali peace conference was fruitless it was not meant to restore peace because government rivals were absent from the talks we need an all inclusive national conference mediated by a neutral country
2428426 we plan to turn the hawiye into a political party which will be open to other interested somalis to join
2428427 hawiye clan elders are opposed to the presence of ethiopian troops in our county but we still have to be engaged in peace
2428428 we stayed here in mogadishu through all this fighting because we thought things would calm down if the government became powerful
2428429 but now the islamists are promising to redouble their attacks and we will be the victims
2428430 a martyr like me should devote his precious life by defending islam
2428431 the terrorists are now using their last gasp to survive
2428432 what is happening now is a security operation and it will continue until security is fully restored

2428458 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2428459 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2428460 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2428461 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2428462 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2428463 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2428496 vi accorgerete con il tempo di tutto il bene che umilmente faceva questuomo lui mi cercava per ripetermi che lui e il movimento di cl volevano servire la chiesa e mi chiedeva sempre di dargli una missione
2428497 la peggiore povert non quella economica ma quella umana da l viene la miseria il degrado e la fame educare uomini nuovi significa far crescere una generazione capace di costruire e quindi di dare un futuro a questo povero paese
2428498 la passione che irradiava in tutto non lasciava indifferente nessuno

2428500 un uomo senza paragoni differente da tutti quelli che incontriamo
2428501 un vero maestro un padre un amico que vive en todos nosotros
2428502 sei stato un maestro eccezionale grazie per lesempio della tua vita

2428526 you could build the infrastructure of a whole society based on our trash
2428527 twenty years ago i wanted to feed the birds in my back yard i went to a store that sold bird feeders and found that most of the feeders were ugly plastic tubes
2428528 i thought wouldnt it be beautiful if a bird could land and feed on something as colorful and beautiful as the bird
2428529 on that basis one friend asked me to join her at a craft fair she was attending so i made 40 more feeders all unique i sold them all within the first two hours at the fair
2428530 a vast network of friends who collect stuff for me often ill wake up and find a bag of copper plates and whatnot on my front porch
2428531 most of the parts that go into these feeders were not attractive in their original form
2428532 i make sure i use high quality seed from a bird supply store
2428533 in louisiana we dont generate so much trash people live much more frugally
2428534 here its a garden of eden for someone like me

2428536 opt for more than one locale for feeding areas she says in the cat book
2428537 with food bowls in different rooms a shy cat can eat in peace while a bully cat finds that he cant be in two places at one time

2428561 precipitous decline in the performance of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2428562 when i retired as chairman allianz was a flourishing vibrant and profitable company with a unique culture that challenged motivated recognized and rewarded employees who worked to make themselves and the company better now
2428563 allianz life is a mere shadow of its former self and may be wounded beyond repair
2428564 a full blown bureaucratic management system has been substituted for an entrepreneurial culture bureaucratic managers have infiltrated the company bringing with them the calcifying taint of the bureaucratic culture
2428565 was that we like many companies are being impacted by the economic slowdown and an acute downturn in financial services
2428566 the problems with allianz life cannot be passed off to others
2428567 but must come to roost at the feet of an ineffective destructive bureaucratic management group and in this regard allianz life unfortunately serves as a wonderful case study for comparing the differences between a bureaucratic and entrepreneurial culture

2428707 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2428708 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2428709 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2428710 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2428711 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2428712 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

2428752 dan barangsiapa yang membunuh seorang mukmin dengan sengaja maka balasannya ialah jahannam kekal ia di dalamnya dan allah murka kepadanya dan mengutukinya serta menyediakan adzab yang besar baginya
2428753 ketika nabi pernah mengatakan kurang lebih begini jika kau di pukul bagian tubuhmu balas lah dengan memukul di bagian yg sama fair dan ketika ane temukan jasad pem fitnah ini yg memfitnah ane dan meresahkan keluarga ane hmmm urusannya sama sangkur poso
2428754 saya itu yakin bahwa pemahaman para pengikut syaikh rabi bin hadi dan syaikh muqbil bin hadi itu
2428755 metode yang mereka pakai adalah googling mencari informasi dengan search engine google ini bukan perbuatan orang muslim tetapi kaum yahudi
2428756 saya percaya apa pun kata hadis anda tentang perilaku sex muhamad tetap anda anggap muhamad itu adalah orang yang mulia dan beraklak baik itu terserah anda
2428757 selama puasa superman sex suka cium dan jilat lidah aisha he he
2428758 muhamad sekali lagi main sex dengan aisha yang lagi menses
2428759 penikahan itu adalah kudus dan sex itu pun adalah kudus jika dilakukan dengan benar tapi oleh kelakukan muhamad menjadikan sex bagi dirinya sebagai kebejatan buat dirinya sendiri bagaimana mungkin nabi terakhir mengambil istri orang lain anak kecil 9 thn disetubuhi ngajarin sex pakai tangan ngurusin cara membersihkan sperma suka berfantasi sex ketika lihat wanita lalu ngak tahan lagi langsung nyalurin ke istrinya suka sex bareng dgn banyak2 istrinya lah ini kan adengan film bf jangan jangan film bf itu berisnpirasi dari kisah muhamad itu gambar 3a cercaan dari prayoto myqers pro aktif yang hingga tanggal 8 agustus 2008 pukul 10 45 ya allah ya rahman ya rahim sungguh engkau menjadi sebaik baik saksi atas kebencian orang orang kafir itu terhadap rasulmu shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan sungguh engkaupun menjadi sebaik baik saksi bahwa myquran menjadi corong corong manusia terlaknat tersebut dalam menghinakan nabimu
2428760 eh alquran yang asli itu sudah dibakar usman cs alquran yang elo pegang itu adalah salinan ke 2 sudah banyak bukti alquran itu kitab sesat yang nyontek dari apocripa palsu dan banyak kontradiksi di dalamnya secara extenal pun alquran itu banyak bohongnya dan kisah alquran punyak bertentangan dgn sejarah dan alkitab kalau dibahas bisa panjang lebar bung
2428761 azab dan neraka bagi orang yang ingar dan mendustai alquran
2428762 di alkitab jelas menyatakan bahwa yesus itu adalah penyelamat dan penolong manusia masakan tuhan ente mau mengutus nabi terakhir setelah isa tapi tuh orang bukan penolong dan penyelamat manusia jika itu terjadi kemungkinan ada 2 1 tuhan ente lagi linglung 2 muhamad nabi palsu percaya ame gue deh ngak akan lari dari 2 kemungkinan itu lah
2428763 semoga anda semakin yakin bahwa alquran adalah wahyu setan yang sengaja menyesatkan manusia dari kebenaran alkitab
2428764 diantara manusia ada orang yang membantah tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan dan mengikuti setiap syaithan yang jahat yang telah ditetapkan terhadap syaithan itu bahwa barangsiapa yang berkawan dengan dia tentu dia akan menyesatkannya dan membawanya ke adzab neraka
2428765 alquran bilang isa bukan hanya utusan tapi sebagai allah god juga
2428766 tapi muhamad malah mati diracun oleh orang yahudi kemudia mati dikuburkan dan tidak bangkit dari kematian
2428767 jika minum khamar adalah perbuatan setan dan allah swt memberi minum khamar di surga islam maka jelas
2428768 tuhan islam itu bisa melakukan perbuatan setan makara atau tipu daya adalah perbuatan iblis yang juga dilakukan oleh allah swt
2428769 he he he he sudah pada frustasi tidak bisa mengelak fakta pengetahuan
2428770 tuhannya muhammad awloh dlm quran yang begitu gila penyembahan adalah bukan tuhan yang sama dengan tuhan para nabi tuhannya muhammad adalah tuhan lain yang tidak ada hubungannya dengan para nabi justru kalau kita mencocokkannya dengan bibel tuhannya muhammad identik dengan setan
2428771 kita tahu bahwa sosok yang mula mula menyesatkan manusia adam adalah setan kemudian awloh mengaku dengan terus terang bahwa dirinya suka menyesatkan manusia dan raja tipu yang lihai
2428772 hanya tuhan sinting saja yg minta dirinya disembah sembah 50 kali sehari
2428773 saya bukan kristen kalau saya disuruh memilih nabi mana yang layak diikuti saya pilih yesus sekalipun yesus bukan tuhan dan bila seandainya allah swt itu tuhan saya lebih memilih tidak ber tuhan daripada bertuhankan sosok jelek seperti allah swt
2428774 saya percaya kalau semua umat beragama bisa hidup rukun bersama yaitu apabila ajaran ajarannya tidak seperti ajaran arab ajaran muhammad itu sangat berbahaya masa dia mengajari kita agar membunuh orang orang di sekeliling kita dia pun juga mencita citakan arab suatu hari nanti bakal menguasai seluruh dunia telaah kritis mana mesti kita ikuti yesus atau muhammad
2428775 kita ikut muhammad sama dengan ikut setan kita ikut yesus sama dengan ikut tuhan
2428776 tetapi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi manusia lain seharusnya kita sadar kalau muhammad adalah alat setan dialah anti kristus
2428777 yesus tidak pernah mengajari kita agar memusuhi muhammad mengajari kita agar memusuhi
2428778 iya kok memang islam telah memfitnah tapi kalau yang berikut ini bukanlah fitnah 1
2428779 to baidowi kalau muslim murtad apa agama yg anda rekomendasikan
2428780 saya nyatakan islam itu jelek karena pendirinya jelek sebaliknya kristen itu baik karena pendirinya baik ini fakta lho
2428781 dan pada hari kiamat kamu akan melihat orang orang yang berbuat dusta terhadap allah mukanya menjadi hitam bukankah dalam neraka jahannam itu ada tempat bagi orang orang yang menyombongkan diri

2428877 what violence or chance so dragged you from the field of campaldino that we know nothing of your burial place
2428878 across the casentino there runs a stream called archiano born in the apennines above the hermitage there at the place where that streams name is lost i came my throat was pierced fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain and there it was that i lost sight and speech and there as i had finished uttering the name of mary i fell and there my flesh alone remained you are aware how in the air moist vapor will gather and again revert to rain as soon as it has climbed where cold enfolds his evil will which only seeks out evil conjoined with intellect and with the power his nature grants he stirred up wind and vapor and then when day was done he filled the valley from pratomagno far as the great ridge with mist the sky above was saturated the dense air was converted into water rain fell and then the gullies had to carry whatever water earth could not receive and when that rain was gathered into torrents it rushed so swiftly toward the royal river that nothing could contain its turbulence the angry archiano at its mouth had found my frozen body and it thrust it in the arno and set loose the cross that on my chest my arms in pain had formed it rolled me on the banks and river bed then covered girded me with its debris

2428880 i was close but thats all i had nothing left in the tank
2428881 i was going full speed all out and i think it ticked my glove
2428882 that man knows how to drive in runs how could he not make the all star team if corey catches that ball it would have been big time the greatest he ran a long way
2428883 thats quinteros first home run in a couple of years
2428884 when it goes bad whatever can go bad goes bad
2428885 whats tough is that we came back the guys kept fighting
2428886 i mean coco cordero had two outs and nobody on base and the next thing you know there is four runs up there
2428887 thats whats tough when you see that happen over and over and it isnt just one or two runs its four runs
2428888 i asked catcher david ross about the pitch and he said it was outside it was close
2428889 then the next pitch is a home run and then lee hits the foul pole for a home run and it was just another bad night
2428890 when i was going bad it was just a matter of having a consistent approach and really swinging at strikes
2428891 you dont have to do anything youre not capable of you just have to stay consistent you look at the great hitters in the game and theyre all consistent go pull up the video right now and theyre not swinging at stuff all over the place theyre staying within the strike zone and staying within their means
2428892 i take pride in my defense and obviously i take pride in hitting but i take more pride in a win
2428893 weve had many discussions about being in command of the strike zone
2428894 hes a very good pupil he listens and responds and remembers and recalls thats what you want young players to do be coachable and retain what youre telling them and take it to the field thats what hes doing
2428895 i stuck with him to try to get him this victory
2428896 its called building young men into men and young pitchers into pitchers thats what were trying to do here trying to accelerate the time process for them being big league pitchers and big league players
2428897 if i played first base and was a big guy id be in the lineup tonight playing first base but im a center fielder and i have to run
2428898 well see how it reacts tomorrow im hoping a couple of days what i dont want is a setback
2428899 when he comes back we want him in there every day
2428900 we know by his record what he means to us
2428901 im a positive person and i believe i can help when you see your teammates out there you want to be out there with them
2428902 i only had 61 pitches after five innings so they told me to pitch to one more batter i got him out in two pitches then the next hitter in three and the last one in six
2428903 when i played shortstop and batted leadoff wednesday it was the first time my brother and i both batted leadoff and played shortstop on the same day
2428904 oh yeah i got him by far he was 1 for 4 and as usual no errors that boy can play
2428905 have you ever seen a reds team so lifeless so dead so disinterested
2428906 a 5 0 lead doesnt hurt psychologically he knows he can beat us psychologically his team knows it and probably psychologically our team knows it plus a lot of great pitching and a lot of luck
2428907 oswalt is a tough tough pitcher and he made some tremendous pitches to encarnacion right there
2428908 we had the same amount of hits 13 but that three run homer was the difference
2428909 hit the ball hard right there but right at him
2428910 we hit a lot of balls hard off oswalt too but right at people
2428911 a tough night once in the field and a tough night once on the bases call it youthful exuberance and he was as upset as anybody he knew he made a mistake and you wont see him make it any time in the future because he is a smart ballplayer sometimes you have to learn the hard way
2428912 i threw a lot of pitches in the first inning but when we scored a lot of runs it seemed they began swinging early in the count
2428913 i tell our young pitchers all the time to run
2428914 i remember watching ferguson jenkins in chicago and hed run from line to line every game whyd he throw 300 innings he ran
2428915 when i was with the dodgers don sutton tommy john rick sutcliffe theyd all take off before bp batting practice up a hill and they didnt come back until after bp guys get hurt doing that artificial stuff the stationary bike and stair climbers im not saying theyre bad but theres no substitute for running
2428916 thats not that many innings and his velocity is still good
2428917 whats happened is hes set the bar so high for himself no 1 and no 2 the league makes adjustments to you after watching film these guys arent going to let you keep getting them out its up to you to make adjustments
2428918 it isnt called the dog days of august because its april sometimes youve got to go into uncharted waters to learn as long as you arent hurt you have to pull through it sometimes you have to give the dudes on the other side some credit you have to make an adjustment hell make it
2428919 why not its his first year in this league not many guys have broken into the league the way he has what am i going to do jump off now because hes had a couple bad starts hes still at the top of the league in a lot of stuff hes fallen off strikeout wise but hes still learning
2428920 i have it in my contract that i get some fragrant flowers in my room on the road
2428921 theyre supposed to be nonsmoking rooms but someone is always smoking those cigars
2428922 his endurance isnt up to starting its a little late in the year to get there
2428923 but hes strong as a bull i like what i see in masset he wants the ball he isnt scared he looks like a tough guy to me you need tough guys
2428924 i was always under the impression that when you do parody its a sign of respect
2428925 if we make fun of grand theft auto were not going to hurt the sales of grand theft auto but yeah weve definitely had some reactions weve had to pull stuff from the game
2428926 im guessing probably more than anyone it was a lawyer

2428939 state toxics rules have a whole laundry list of stringent limits for plants that discharge to inland surface waters

2428944 there was no single fair way to interpret that without disenfranchising somebody
2428945 so i asked that the count be done both ways in both cases the protest didnt succeed
2428946 we will want to go through every single invalidated protest we want to know why and who was considered invalid
2428947 we hope well have a community that will come together because we certainly are divided
2428948 its sufficient to say something may have occurred in that area at that time
2428949 but were not necessarily restricting our investigation to that time
2428950 men say they know many things but lo they have taken wings and a thousand appliances the wind that blows is all that anybody knows

2428963 we had been hoping he would turn up riding on some trains or trams but he has not used his electronic public transport pass
2428964 the saving grace my theory is that he was a small orphan so might be able to survive
2428965 he does not have any money or other family in australia
2428966 we will be appealing for help through the media distributing posters of the boy in the cbd and on public transport
2428967 he appears to be a happy and friendly child who would talk to anyone and is very quick on his feet
2428968 i welcome this bold initiative and the willingness of the australian government to join with employers to prepare aboriginal people for employment and to create real jobs for our people
2428969 the prime minister has talked about the need for a strong and close partnership with indigenous people in order for this plan to have any chance of success
2428970 exactly how did we arrive at this situation where indigenous people are not job ready and are often unable to access employment opportunities
2428971 our challenge has been that the education system has failed aboriginal people and we have never received adequate funding to properly train our people and create real and sustainable jobs
2428972 the key to indigenous economic prosperity is within the land rights act

2428989 true goodliness does not turn men out of the world but enables them to live better in it and excites their endeavors to mend it
2428990 i think what we do is a very big wellness program
2428991 grief can be like a roller coaster you can feel happy then sad then happy then sad you feel you should be getting better better better better but grief is better
2428992 i heard you do bereavement counseling i think im fine but i might need a group at some point
2428993 have you thought that maybe youre in a little shock that it hasnt permeated your body in every pore that your husband has died
2428994 yes i forget about it sometimes i woke up this morning and it took me a minute before i remembered
2428995 sometimes families dont understand the reactions of different children one child is crying the others not well ask what were they like before you grieve in character if you were a crier before youll probably be a crier now
2428996 im not the only one who hasnt given the clothing away and its been two years
2428997 im not the only one who goes to the cemetery every day
2428998 im a runner and the cemetery is in my town every morning i run and i go to the cemetery and i lie down on her grave

2429004 we tell people trust your gut that you know what you need if you need to stay home from work one day because you just need to cry or go to the cemetery do that its ok attend to your wound this doesnt get better by itself it doesnt get better with time its what you do with that time
2429005 our goal is to teach volunteers how to be present the biggest gift you can give anybody is to let them know that you hear what theyre saying
2429006 in a very visual way the kids see that theyre not the only one going through the death of a loved one they see theyre all different and have done this work in different ways
2429007 ive always been the kind of person that when im afraid of something i dont run away from it i go to it i want to figure it out

2429020 i often think ive gone through my life thinking of myself in mythological terms looking at my life as a series of quests with obstacles in my way im always looking for the magical dust or the implement or sword thats going to help me get through the obstacle to my goal
2429021 why would you want to do this you little girl
2429022 after i fell i could have said i dont want to do this but instead i said i need lessons i wanted to do it so i learned how to do it and i liked it i loved it in fact
2429023 over time i learned that the climbers who were less likely to die were the ones who prepared very carefully they were risk takers but they prepared themselves well ive drawn on that lesson many many times
2429024 the standard climbing rule is you need three points of contact with the rock but there are times where you have only one point of stability the point youre pushing off from to reach a point of safety you have to go past a point of no safety you have to have faith
2429025 i think something actually physically changes in people in how they hold themselves when theyre committed to a path
2429026 for many years i think i was waiting to be anointed like the girl at the soda fountain who gets tapped to be a movie star i had this idea that writers were picked now i realize that writing is not a divine gift its a craft if you want to do it you get an apprenticeship
2429027 what gandhi thinks what he feels what he says and what he does are all the same

2429029 its called the church for all people and it is nobodys excluded women can be ordained gays can get married
2429030 its what i think of the catholic church being like in the early days when it was a new community everybody was on equal footing and services were held in peoples homes
2429031 christs message is peace compassion and loving your neighbor thats basically the buddhas message too peace compassion loving kindness no killing no violence
2429032 it was all about religion and nothing about spirituality it was pray pay and obey do the prayers they tell you to do pay your donation every sunday and do whatever they tell you
2429033 i started reading about taoism i didnt understand any of it but there was something about it that so wonderful and so peaceful i knew it was something i wanted
2429034 you dont withhold somebodys money from them to me thats part of my spirituality its the right thing to do
2429035 what do i need to go for im not the one whos sick
2429036 i was scared i was single my marriage was over i was starting my own business i had a mortgage to pay i had a co op but i was listening i began to realize that if things were going to change it had to start with me
2429037 i realized the power of being ethical in business it was scary but it was also kind of cool i was relieved to be out of there in al anon you start learning to throw off all the lies and all the trappings and to be honest and be who you are
2429038 i did the right thing and it got me fired i wont do
2429039 oh my god im in one those michael douglas movies about the wall street tycoon whos trying to get everybody do something illegal

2429041 its all one now im one person i dont have a work persona and a non work persona
2429042 any tangible or intangible thing that has value to an organization
2429043 to achieve and maintain appropriate protection of organizational assets all assets should be accounted for and have a nominated owner owners should be identified for all assets and the responsibility for the maintenance of appropriate controls should be assigned the implementation of specific controls may be delegated by the owner as appropriate but the owner remains responsible for the proper protection of the assets
2429044 im currently standing on the stage of the detroit opera theater
2429045 sit down and make a list of all the things you dream of doing with your life
2429046 what is the most wild and outrageous thing you could do
2429047 a lot of the shifts in my life can be traced to being young and na ve and stupid enough to take risks
2429048 the style of writing for radio and the style of writing for children are very similar i didnt know this at the time but it worked out perfectly
2429049 how about a magazine for girls that girls would run
2429050 experience has shown me that good things will come along in life
2429051 when youve been through a life or death transformation you realize its possible for things to be radically changed
2429052 what i enjoy most is helping people understand how important the father daughter relationship is and inspiring them to do something about it
2429053 see i told you wed find someone cool out here
2429054 these speakers will turn your 5 1 surround sound into 7 3

2429063 theres an archeological quality to our bodies events are inscribed in our musculature our posture and facial expressions its like the rings of a tree
2429064 i always enter therapeutic relationships with the presumption that the person is always there for a spiritual as well as a physical reason
2429065 i put my hands lightly on her body and moved very slowly at a certain point i felt her take a deep sigh and her body moved into the table it was almost as if her body took my hand
2429066 for the entire half hour he was with me he was crying
2429067 i always knew how to do bodywork i knew where to touch people but moreover felt their brokenness where they were sad tense or weak
2429068 god has a sense of humor in order to do this thing that was my dream i had to do things that were completely counter character
2429069 in order to heal and stay healed people have to change their habits often you have to change on very deep levels habits are as much defined by your psychology and spirituality how you look at life by as physical behaviors
2429070 what i do now is not what chiropractors do and its not what body workers do and its not what movement specialists do its a hybrid of lots of different things its not something i thought i would ever get the chance to do
2429071 our peacekeepeers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace

2429073 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2429074 he pretended to be wealthy but i noticed he used to show up hungry
2429075 his sports jackets smelled like they needed a visit to the dry cleaner he drove an old brown datsun or toyota it was hardly the car of a wealthy young man
2429076 i know those beady eyes i dont need fingerprints to know it is him
2429077 if you dont do that that emotion will continue to be pent up
2429078 the perfect opportunity would be before she speaks to have some opportunity for a celebration
2429079 were basically saying what do you want thats what the discussion is
2429080 we want to make sure that sen clintons supporters have the opportunity to express their enthusiasm for her when she speaks
2429081 my view is she should not put her name in nomination and she should just go tell her supporters lets suck it up this is a grown up game here
2429082 need to be given their due she lost by a smidgen
2429083 id be happy if theyd just give her the nomination but i know that cant happen
2429084 hosting the olympic games has been a century old dream for the chinese nation
2429085 one section required that more than 600 performers should have uniform expression in their eyes so they must have exquisite feelings and they have to work very hard
2429086 the national olympic committees were in agreement but the political powers were not
2429087 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2429088 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2429089 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2429090 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2429091 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2429092 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2429149 every jewish teacher worth his salt had his circle of disciples who followed him literally walking behind him as he rode or walked ahead looked after his daily needs and soaked up his teaching their teacher was the most important person in their lives
2429150 and he went up to the mountain and summoned those whom he himself wanted and they came to him and he appointed the twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach and to have authority to cast out demons
2429151 and they tie up heavy loads and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger
2429152 come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you shall find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my load is light
2429153 then jesus spoke to the multitudes and to his disciples saying the scribes and the pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of moses therefore all that they tell you do and observe but do not do according to their deeds for they say things and do not do them and they tie up heavy loads and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger but they do all their deeds to be noticed by men for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments and they love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the market places and being called by men rabbi but do not be called rabbi for one is your teacher and you are all brothers and do not call anyone on earth your father for one is your father he who is in heaven and do not be called leaders for one is your leader that is christ but the greatest among you shall be your servant and whoever exalts himself shall be humbled and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted
2429154 but do not be called rabbi for one is your teacher and you are all brothers and do not call anyone on earth your father for one is your father he who is in heaven and do not be called leaders for one is your leader that is christ but the greatest among you shall be your servant and whoever exalts himself shall be humbled and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted

2429189 so much of the creative life has its source in the erotic the first impulse is strongly erotic but then one becomes reflective a philosophic human being an explorer and then as one grows older and older theres a need to renew that energy associated with erotic impulse
2429190 a poet without a strong libido almost inevitably belongs to the weaker category such a poet can carry off a technical effect with a degree of flourish but the poem does not embody the dominant emotive element in the life process
2429191 that is certainly one of the problems when making a poem is thought to be a rational production the dominance of reason as in eighteenth century poetry diminished the power of poetry
2429192 reason certainly has a place but it cannot be dominant
2429193 thats the nature of aesthetic impulse aesthetic receptivity whether youre walking through the garden or reading a poem theres a sense of fulfillment youve gone through a complete chain of experience changing and communicating with each step and with each line so that you are linked with the phenomenon of time itself the erotic impulse is so basic to human experience that we can never be free from it even in old age

2429234 when these plans for ohare were first being put together oil was nowhere near 50 a barrel let alone 100
2429235 airlines are challenged right now and we at ohare want them to be able to get back on their feet
2429236 but for them to add more profitable routes they need more runways here ohare hasnt added a new runway since 1971
2429237 making ohare more efficient is an incredibly important move for aviation infrastructure
2429238 its a challenge for chicago to finish ohare but they have to press ahead they have to be successful
2429239 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2429241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2429242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2429243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2429244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2429245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2429246 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2429370 when an advertising copywriter writes a great tagline for a commercial that gets aired over and over does he get a residual no when a fashion designer for calvin klein designs a unique sweater does he she get a residual every time a person wears that sweater no wga writers and every other union member in the entertainment industry have sweetheart deals and should stop bitching
2429371 a residual is a deferred payment against the lifetime value of a script
2429372 when an engineer develops a product for a company should the engineer receive compensation each time the company figures out a new market for the product or a new application for the product

2429380 this is just a case of the rich trying to get richer from both the producers end and the writers end

2429389 the notion of taking out more money from a business thats nascent just seems crazy to us the problem is we said the same thing about dvd and it became a 10 billion business

2429394 lead by individuals who are using passion to drive their decisions not logic
2429395 i am looking at the wga strike from a diferent prespective
2429396 take a well written nicely thought out five paragraph opinion
2429397 i just dont see the correlation being accurate between wga members getting what they want in residuals guaranteeing the iatse members will get an equivalent deal when their contract comes up for negotiation
2429398 we really need to make sure that our iatse brothers get an even share of this revenue source even if we have to settle for less
2429399 ah crud i didnt understand how much what i did could have been worth give me more money now
2429400 gs pay scale 2007 on your favorite web search engine
2429401 then the membership will realize as always that the writers got fucked
2429402 look we went back to the table but those greedy schmucks with typewriters are so unreasonable we just cant give in to their crazy demands
2429403 in the interest of our many viewers and the poor writers out of work by the short sightedness of the wga weve decided that its in the best interest of all to dissolve our relationship with the wga and start a new joint venture with any writer willing to resigned from that unreasonable organization well increase pay pension benefits and offer profit sharing on dvd and internet income and in the future well re visit how we pay our new employees and see if they need an increase in pay or benefits or if those things need to be decreased based on an income to profits ratio golly i wonder what will happen then and of course our new plan will require complete loyalty each writer will have to sign an oath swearing to never unionize again to the amptp and it goes without saying you can trust us were very honest folk and respect the work writers do completely
2429404 however the wgas contract is not with networks it is with producers who receive no proceeds from these advertisements just as they receive none of the revenue achieved by networks through commercial television
2429405 it is important to make clear that writers currently do receive residuals for digital downloading regardless of whether the download is temporary or permanent the guild is seeking at least a 700 percent increase over what writers currently receive and more than a 200 percent increase over what they receive for internet pay per view
2429406 has offered to pay writers a percentage of the revenues the producer receives from licensing streamed content on the internet
2429407 no labor agreement in history has given writers actors or directors a portion of advertising dollars
2429408 theres a paradigm shift in how entertainment is distributed and consumed
2429409 and for all the iatse members or those pretending to be bitching about being out of work you need to realize that youre lack of solidarity only strengthens the studios hand which will make them less likely to bargain in good faith
2429410 now is the time to save all our shows mail pencils pencils to the amptp and to any studios whose shows you enjoy maybe we can help the studios see just how much support the wga has and maybe just maybe we can give them a graceful way out not because theyre buckling under the writers demands but because they care so much about their audience us and isnt that supposed to be their job
2429411 ive called my cable provider to suspend my service until the networks are willing to provide me with quality programming
2429412 they say in harlan county there are no neutrals there youll either be a union man or a thug for j h blair
2429413 please let us paypal a few bucks into the keep a striking writer eating fund
2429414 paid for by a fan of l amp o svu
2429415 in support of the writers i will not buy any dvds watch any reruns or internet programming until the strike is over please be fair
2429416 anything we have left over from our costs will go into the union solidarity fund which was created to help non wga members affected by the strike
2429417 you can no longer continue to underestimate the power and intelligence of television viewers if you think we are going to side with the studios and networks on these issues just because our favorite shows are shutting down you are sadly mistaken we know the true issues of this strike and we support the writers efforts in obtaining their share of your exploitation of their work in various digital media for your personal gain
2429418 no please i dont want to get paid for my work the joy i bring to the faces of media moguls everywhere is reward enough

2429433 we will not have you tell us how we will respond to the issues that concern us we will decide how we respond we are not going away if you find our response unreasonable illogical perhaps it is because we have been reasonable and logical for far too long
2429434 and yes i can see a day we will go back to our land and reclaim it there will not be military action because that is not our way but we will go on to the state owned farms into the forests to the wild places where very few people live and we will say this is ours now try and stop us taking it weve been patient weve believed your fine words for too long we know what is right

2429465 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2429466 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2429467 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2429468 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2429469 what is going on is a massive bombardment of residential quarters in tshkinvali and other towns too

2429483 ik ben geboren 22 september 1864 te hilversum op het lieve kleine buiten aan den s gravelandschen weg dat nu nog
2429484 bedankt inzenders we hebben een fout gemaakt we hebben al een naam die voldoet
2429485 de nieuwe naam moet dan echt een gouden greep zijn zo iets als marktplein langgewenscht
2429486 kijk dat is onder mijn bestuur tot stand gekomen dit geweldige project
2429487 hans ga een s bij piet kijken hoe je een performance nu echt moet aanpakken
2429488 rio ferdinands been one of my heroes from the first time i saw him playing the game and all of a sudden i was sat next to him sunbathing
2429489 i was taking freekicks with david beckham in training and i never thought i would be doing something like that
2429490 it was great to be a part of the whole set up but once youve experienced it once you dont really want to miss out on it again
2429491 i told myself not to be disappointed if i didnt play but thats easier said than done i know it was a great learning experience but i want to get myself into a position where i can turn up at an england camp like that and end the week by playing in the game thats definitely one of my biggest ambitions for this season
2429492 last summer i was hoping to get the odd chance in the first team but wasnt really sure how many of those i would get
2429493 this time around its much better to know that i probably will be starting in the team
2429494 but the flip side of that is that my physical fitness was probably better at the start of last season with being away with england i didnt really get too much of a break and theres also not that element of surprise any more
2429495 i was a bit of an unknown quantity last season and opposition players probably didnt know what i was about thats not the case any more and there are plenty of young players here wanting to move me out of the team
2429496 it feels like weve got a really good core of players now who can be the future of the club for three or four seasons
2429497 this doesnt feel temporary any more which has maybe been a criticism in the past it feels like its something that is building towards the future
2429498 when steve mcclaren was the manager he tended to buy seasoned veterans and that type of player will only last for a while if youre signing older players youre going to be changing them around every year or so but if you buy younger players like we have been theres no reason why they shouldnt stick around for much longer so you only have to add one or two new faces each summer
2429499 its funny because when i was away with england i was talking to woody about his first trip back to middlesbrough
2429500 i reminded him of that within about ten minutes of the fixtures coming out
2429501 seeing the effort people like jemma put into their training and their dedication to the sport is pretty impressive and humbling
2429502 you can see her drive a mile off shes got a cracking attitude
2429503 its a bit overwhelming when you first get here and realise just how massive this event is
2429504 the olympic village is amazing youd never believe how big the dining hall is
2429505 all you have is red blue and yellow and you cant stop so the color is easier to correct
2429506 before i went over i didnt know what i was letting myself in for like if i had to keep my distance
2429507 but i watched training they brought me straight into their team meeting before they played ireland couldnt have been nicer to me
2429508 brilliant coaching brilliant players down toearth lads who train extremely hard extremely long
2429509 i watched their coaching they have a lot of staff a backs coach kicking coach someone for the scrum staff everywhere i didnt go there to learn about rugby im no rugby expert i like the game and i like to watch it
2429510 last year i had so much focus on the players i maybe took my eye off the staff he admitted
2429511 i think the staff were more stressed than the players by the end of the season so were looking to share the load to bring in one or two more staff to help out
2429512 ive got a lot of respect for the rugby lads anyway before speaking to them youre always a bit nervous about how its going to pan out
2429513 they seemed interested there were some good questions not like whos your favourite player his audience clearly well aware of the irishmans colourful career were bold enough to quiz him over his infamous tackle on alf inge haaland
2429514 one of the coaching staff asked me about my tackle on haaland why i done it and the history behind it that tested me last time i was asked that was by an fa lawyer
2429515 graham henry has a situation with the all blacks where theyre expected to win every game and them coming on the back of i suppose being hammered in the world cup i spoke to them about my experiences of playing at a decent level for a long time
2429516 the rugby lads seem to trust their players a lot more i met the irish team for dinner and they came up all very casually dressed allowed to do what they wanted during the week
2429517 i know a lot about tino and nobby i have watched them play
2429518 jonas is definitely the sort of player who can excite the fans i think they will love him for a lot of reasons
2429519 but the main thing apart from his pace is that whoever plays up front will like him because he is a supplier of goals
2429520 we cant use it anymore because the rules have changed and we cannot use the mask
2429521 he can be a big success there after playing in a strong league in argentina and then again in la liga in spain
2429522 when kenny dalglish signed me i did not know too much english but newcastle is a great city and once you are settled it is up to you to do your job on the field and work as hard as you can for the fans
2429523 theres a lot of competition for those two wide places because he can play right or left theyre his two best positions
2429524 the younger players can take more in and they are open to new ideas theres a willingness to push each other the camaraderie of the group this summer has been really impressive
2429525 this league is in danger of becoming the most boring great league in the world this wont be a champions league club while im here with the way the league is at the moment
2429526 my argument was very valid then and it still is now
2429527 we try to strengthen to catch them the top four but they then strengthen to keep us away
2429528 a lot of people said i should be more positive but being realistic is important and at the moment they are a little way ahead of us the league table tells you that
2429529 they have so many quality players star internationals for their countries and that means a lot of the clubs in the premier league cannot match that the odds are a little bit against you but you have to believe you have a chance
2429530 what would be a success this season top eight i think somewhere between four and eight
2429531 if you look at it purely from a crowds point of view we are the third biggest stadium in the country
2429532 if you look at how strong our fan base is in the north east we should be able to make st james park a fortress a difficult place to come and get points
2429533 the top eight would be great and then it would be a case of progressing from there between four and eight would be fantastic
2429534 were not as short as the press have been saying
2429535 we have a lot of quality the hard is part is finding more quality players to add to it anybody can gather players its the easiest thing in the world
2429536 people will look at the situation and make their own minds up
2429537 we had long conversations with the squad last season and that was important for what we are trying to do and how we get there
2429538 we reminded everyone what the club stands for we are owned by a middlesbrough person its increasingly rare in a modern game full of foreign ownership and we have a vision
2429539 the finances have been difficult at this club for the last two years but we own the ground and the training ground and many clubs cant say that
2429540 but the most important thing is the team i want the whole team and squad to know what our aim is our aim has to be the champions league and while many disagree the only limits are your beliefs
2429541 my vision as a player was always to play for england
2429542 im here because its something im trying to build i have been here seven years and if im here for another seven i will be doing something right
2429543 our reputation for giving young lads a chance played a part
2429544 we have altered the profile of the squad completely we had lots of players my age over 30s some were a real struggle to get out of the team
2429545 one of the jobs given to me when i came in was to reduce the age of the squad reduce the wage to a manageable level we started to see glimpses and the benefits of that last year and we will see it again this year i hope
2429546 theres lot of exciting players we have a stronger base to work with than in recent years and im satisfied with the progress we have made
2429547 having come through the last 18 months i can handle anything

2429617 for a while he was the enemy so i need a little help
2429618 we started on two separate paths but were on one journey now
2429619 like two sides of the same coin and that doesnt amount to a whole lot of change
2429620 shell have a huge effect on whether obama gets the support of her followers
2429621 her eyes were brighter she had bigger hand gestures it was more passionate before she was a little tepid
2429622 i know that we can come together if we keep having events like this
2429623 has earned a very large role in the future of the republican party
2429624 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2429625 i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2429626 russia should not be in the g 8 and by the way continued russian behavior indicates that russia is moving further and further from the principles and values and ideals of the g 8
2429627 i know by the way and you know that sen obama will give a great speech at their convention before 75 000 people in denver and i dont expect to match up to that and in the debates i expect him to do extremely well hes very very good
2429628 but i think its going to be substance that matters and i think its going to be vision for america and i think its going to be concrete plans of action but dont underestimate the challenges we face
2429629 god called them home and he called them at a good time
2429630 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2429631 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2429632 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2429633 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2429634 the advertising model has made internet content and services available to millions of people in the united states and around the world for free
2429635 customized advertising gives users a better experience and helps them save time and money
2429636 the opportunity to support content that otherwise would not be supported with mass media economics
2429637 the growing trend of companies tailoring internet advertising based on consumers internet search surfing or other use
2429638 yahoos argument that without digital data collection there would be an absence of free editorial content online is disingenuous and self serving
2429639 thats a year removed we dont dwell on those things you guys do
2429640 i just try to keep things as simple as possible i try to lead a lap to get the five bonus points and try to lead the most laps if i can and try to finish as good as i can without sticking it in the fence
2429641 fortunately we have been lucky enough to win seven races we can only hope that we win a couple more and try to get further ahead of the competition when the chase starts
2429642 yes i think so i think a lot of it might have been not so much the competition itself but the personalities the dale earnhardts the darrell waltrips the bobby allisons and others
2429643 we have a lot of great personalities now but the sport itself has become a whole lot more corporate and a lot less personal in that respect you have to be a whole lot more stale today than you want to be
2429644 the racing was different but i personally dont think it was better then i think actually if you laid down two races side by side what we have today and what they had then i think you would sell more tickets to what we have today but i think if you ask the fans what lot of drivers they would prefer they might say the old guys i would
2429645 i wouldnt like to see it done just by watching the race last week there was really no passing unless someone ran off the racetrack
2429646 i thought goodyear did an excellent job of showing how prepared they were for that
2429647 im their biggest critic at times but im the first guy that when they do things right im going to praise them too

2429651 tidak aku tidak mau jadi orang jawa yang nrimo itu sudah kuno aku manusia baru aku bukan proyek feodalisme yang mau saja menjadi budak segala ketidakadilan ini aku mau berontak

2429655 celebrate the spirit of olympiad capture the excitement of the olympic games and help to showcase the chinese tradition and culture
2429656 i am so happy to see china hosting the olympic games in my life time and i believe everybody live here feels the same way
2429657 i think this will be a good opportunity for us to learn more about the culture of our ancestors and to improve relations between the two countries
2429658 the modus operandi matches with the confession of naser of using explosive laden cars to strike at their desired targets
2429659 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2429660 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet

2429790 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2429791 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2429792 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2429793 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2429799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2429800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2429900 but things have changed i needed building regulations approval and ive been arguing with the fire department about the need for a sprinkler system my neighbors claim that i should have obtained planning permission for building the ark in my garden because it is considered development of the site even though in my view it is a temporary structure we then had to go to appeal to the secretary of state for a decision then the department of transportation demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstruction to clear the passage for the arks move to the sea i told them that the sea woulod be coming to us but they would hear nothing of it getting the wood was another problem all of the decent trees have tree preservation orders on them and we live in a site of special scientific interest set up in order to protect the spotted owl i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls but no go when i started planning to gather the animals the s p c a sued me they insisted that i would be confining wild animals against their will they argued the accommodation would be too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space then the county council the environmental protection agency and the rivers authority ruled that i couldnt build the ark until they conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood im still trying to resolve a complaint with the equal opportunities commission on how many disabled carpenters im supposed to hire for my building team the trade unions say i cant use my sons they insist i have to hire only accredited workers with ark building experience to make matters worse customs seized all my assets claiming im trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species so forgive me lord but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark

2429903 no they replied there may not be enough for both us and you instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves 45you didnt greet me with a kiss but from the time i first came in she has not stopped kissing my feet

2429952 theres nothing wrong with the point and click navigation model of the mouse although it can degenerate into mystery meat navigation if youre not careful i dont expect web designers to create keyboard centric websites the mouse is a natural and intuitive enough way to navigate web sites but so is the keyboard in certain circumstances what frustrates me is when web developers fail to pay attention to the most rudimentary of keyboard support in their designs
