9180100 the public health interest prevailed over the profit interests of big pharmaceutical companies that tried to derail the passage of the law since day one the final bill may still lack some of the measures that will ultimately provide the consumers with lower cost but of the same quality of generic medicines and congress can persevere to pass the other measures in the future
9180101 we laud the members of the house of representatives for standing their ground on the generics act amendment because this is one of the measures for the public to have access to affordable and quality medicines and increase the poor patients chance of recovering from their illness
9180102 the introduction of public health safeguards in the philippine patent laws is a major victory in itself for all people across the country seeking affordable access to medicines it could improve the lives of millions of filipinos suffering from ill health if the patent flexibilities are used effectively
9180103 apart from getting this bill passed another biggest gain of the advocates of this bill is the opening of space for civil society organizations to engage and work together with the government we hope to see this participatory process to continue during the crafting of the irr down to its implementation
9180104 it took a while before the president is able to sign this landmark bill and the challenge now lies on the doh dti and ipo to bring relief to poor consumers amid the increasing prices on basic commodities

9180108 there is much at stake for the sps because if we win this case it would allow any victims family to claim compensation if they were harmed by a prisoner who was released negligently
9180109 their solicitors are saying there is no legal duty of care to the public
9180110 im sure this will come as a surprise to many members of the public
9180111 if for instance they were to release a psychopath by mistake and he murdered a whole crowd of schoolchildren they would not be responsible
9180112 having regard to campbells record it was reasonably foreseeable that he would be involved in further violent offending on his release
9180113 his violent behaviour which was predictable was the cause of catherine thomsons death the reasonable precaution whereby the death may have been avoided would have been to carry out an assessment regarding risk to the community and to put in place measures to minimise the potential risk
9180114 if no such measures were possible then campbell should not have been released
9180115 there is no question that over the past five years there has been huge pressure to send more and more people into open prisons
9180116 there is a duty to keep the public safe the service has a duty to take all reasonable steps to make sure risk to the public is minimised
9180117 the prison numbers have gone up and the staff numbers have gone down which means no one is doing their job properly the staff are rushing around and so risk assessments are not nailed down
9180118 the scottish prison service was to blame for catherines death and they should be brought to account for that
9180119 nothing will bring catherine back but we need to take a stand because it may prevent another tragedy from happening to someone else

9180147 we are immensely fortunate and grateful that his holiness the dalai lama has consented to take part in person here but due to a slight indisposition this could not happen
9180148 however his holiness is observing the fasting and prayer from mumbai today and we convey our immense gratitude and respect to him
9180149 protest led by hatred rancour and anger but by the teachings of the lord buddha in all the vehicles to refrain from harming others and do everything to benefit others with love and compassion which is the essence of spiritual practice
9180150 due to the consistent effort and guidance of his holiness the dalai lama to pursue non violent methods to resolve the tibetan issue it has been many years that most of the tibetan movements remained free from gross physical violence he said
9180151 this garnered immense support from around the world for the just cause of tibet
9180152 our pursuit of non violence has not only enabled us to keep alive the tibetan issue but also compelled the peoples republic of china to respond to our policy of rapprochement irrespective of their sincerity
9180153 ultimately help change the mind of the prc authorities to more compassionate
9180154 concerted non violent efforts to bring natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet
9180155 we pay our condolence and homage to those who lost their lives and those who are imprisoned tortured and beaten in the recent uprisings in tibet
9180156 we also pray and sympathise for the victims of the earthquakes in sichuan and the one in south western tibet recently and the disaster caused by flood in some other part as well
9180157 padahal baru kemarin keluar dari bengkel barangkali memang sudah waktunya turun mesin
9180158 sudah sebulanan mobil itu selalu rewel padahal biasanya baik baik saja saya bahkan sering memakainya untuk pergi ke luar kota memang sudah waktunya pensiun barangkali tapi mobil itu punya kenangan yang tak bisa digantikan dengan apa pun jadi saya merasa sayang menjual dan menggantikannya dengan yang baru
9180159 mobil itu memang bandel jarang rewel saya tahu sejarahnya dulu waktu masih digunakan almarhum pak alanudin mobil itu juga sehat sehat saja
9180160 atau kalau bukan karena sudah rusak barangkali seperti manusia saja pak mobil pun terkadang bisa kehilangan mood barangkali sedang kesal sama bapak
9180161 haha itu sih filosofi jawa dalam cerita pewayangan punakawan saja pernah marah karena semar mau dikorbankan demi kepentingan pandawa
9180162 saya berhenti merokok sebulan ini batuk batuk terus paru paru tua saya sudah tidak kuat lagi menampung asap rokok saya malah dimarahi istri saya daripada bikin penyakit katanya lebih baik duit saya ditabung buat membelikan cucu saya mainan
9180163 wah saya sudah kemalaman kalau begitu saya titipkan saja mobil saya di sini biar besok saja ngurusnya saya capek
9180164 ah tidak tidak ada yang penting saya cuma kepingin ngobrol dengannya
9180165 biasanya kalau sedang bebas tugas pak arsa suka menunggui anaknya berjualan jagung bakar di perempatan sudirman pak
9180166 ini anak saya indah dan ini suaminya harno indah sedang hamil delapan bulan anak pertama
9180167 mumpung di sini pak anton harus mencoba jagung bakar buatan anak saya mau rasa apa manis pedas atau asin pedas
9180168 belum pak rupanya mobil saya benar benar ngambek pada saya sampai hari ini pun dia belum mau berbaikan dengan saya dia malah memilih ngendon di bengkel
9180169 pak anton rupanya memikirkan kata kata saya kemarin ya saya cuma bercanda jangan dimasukkan ke hati pak
9180170 oh nggak nggak saya rasa mungkin ada benarnya juga kata kata bapak saya jadi interospeksi diri justru saya harus berterima kasih pada pak arsa
9180171 oh nggak nggak jangan bilang begitu pak saya senang ada yang mengingatkan
9180172 saya berpikir mungkin ada benarnya filosofi bapak tentang kedekatan kendaraan dengan pemiliknya tuhan memperingatkan manusia melalui apa saja juga melalui kendaraan yang biasa kita pakai sesuatu yang dekat dengan keseharian kita saya heran juga karena selama ini mobil itu tidak pernah rewel tiba tiba sebulanan ini dia selalu mengganggu kenyamanan saya entah kenapa barangkali ada yang salah dengan saya
9180173 ya selama masih dipakai pak alanudin mertua bapak pemilik perusahaan kita saya sering diajak mancing beliau di waktu waktu senggang bukan hanya itu kadang beliau meminta saya menemani beliau pergi ke acara acara tertentu jadi saya pernah akrab dengan mobil itu sampai akhirnya berpindah tangan ke bapak ketika bapak menikahi putri beliau
9180174 kalau mobil saya itu tidak mau berbaikan dengan saya lagi berarti saya harus berganti mobil pak
9180175 kenangan akan tersimpan baik dalam hati kita pak ia tetap akan melekat di sana selamanya
9180176 bapak mertua saya pasti kecewa karena saya tidak dapat menjaga amanah beliau
9180177 ngomong ngomong pak arsa menurut bapak mobil itu memang sedang marah pada saya
9180178 ah sekali lagi itu hanya gurauan saya saja pak saya benar benar minta maaf kalau gurauan saya menyinggung bapak
9180179 untuk guyonan bapak itu dan jagung bakar yang lezat ini
9180180 kita hanya menonton dan tak melakukan apa apa lagi pula tak ada yang tahu
9180181 todos os passageiros estar o em casa amanh s primeiras horas
9180182 em nenhum momento esteve em causa a seguran a dos passageiros do voo orbest 202 canc n lisboa
9180183 opt mos por dividir os passageiros em dois voos a chegada de duzentos dos 338 passageiros est prevista para as 05h00 de domingo os restantes dever o chegar mais ou menos mesma hora no voo 9866 da iberworld
9180184 o atraso deveu se a um problema t cnico que n o impedia que o avi o operasse em seguran a nomeadamente a uma avaria num fus vel do piloto autom tico que impedia que o comandante e o co piloto tivessem informa o necess ria relativa pot ncia dos motores
9180185 isso n o impedia o avi o de voar simplesmente tivemos que tra ar uma nova rota e diminuir a tonelagem do avi o na descolagem como estipulado pelas regras da aeron utica internacional
9180186 ou se diminu a na carga ou ent o no n mero de passageiros dividindo os
9180187 como n o se conseguiu chegar a um consenso com os passageiros o comandante decidiu n o sair at ter uma solu o que agradasse a todos
9180188 todo o acompanhamento poss vel fosse prestado aos passageiros com vista a minimizar o inc modo causado pela situa o
9180189 surpreendidos com um atraso de tr s horas devido a um problema t cnico na aeronave
9180190 assim procedemos ao embarque e quando est vamos instalados fomos informados que o problema se mantinha ou seja a avaria no motor subsistia pelo que uma parte das bagagem ficou em terra pois tiveram de reduzir o peso bem como uma parte do combust vel diminuindo a autonomia do voo
9180191 isto quem quer vai quem n o quer fica estamos aterrorizados receamos a viagem

9180193 we are very pleased to welcome dan to the lycoming staff
9180194 chris has done a terrific job with the program in her time as the head coach and were excited about the enhanced administrative role she will hold within the department
9180195 in a way mccain has set a trap on the experience argument
9180196 because if they start picking on her on experience its going to backfire with women
9180197 barack obama selected one of the most qualified people available for the job of vice president john mccain picked one of the least qualified who really puts country ahead of politics
9180198 playing golf during a war just sends the wrong signal
9180199 can you please show me how to do it correctly then
9180200 you are entitled to your opinion but i dont agree

9180202 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9180203 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9180204 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9180205 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9180206 there is an understandable concern about the high price of gas and food and many americans are worried about the health of our housing and job markets i share these concerns about our economy

9180212 following discussions with the board i have now decided to step down with immediate effect
9180213 the roll of fringe director has taken me away from my first love producing and presenting exciting performances to audiences and my intention is to return to that more direct relationship with artists and audiences
9180214 t is conceivable that some people will think john mccain picked sarah palin to be his running mate because she is a woman i know you find this shocking but i swear i have heard it mentioned mccain does not believe in pandering to identity politics he was looking for someone who was well prepared to fight against international islamic extremism the transcendent issue of our time and in the end he decided that in good conscience he was not going to settle for anyone who had not been commander of a state national guard for at least a year and a half he put down his foot the obvious choice was palin the governor of alaska whose guard stands as our last best defense against possible attack by the resurgent russian menace across the bering strait
9180215 regrettably neither she nor john mccain supports our bottom line issues including reproductive rights for women while his selection of governor palin as his running mate on the republican presidential ticket is a recognition of the importance of womens support and votes in this election and an acknowledgement of the leadership capabilities of women it is unfortunate that their position on issues of fundamental importance to our members precludes us from supporting her

9180218 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
9180219 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of each of those countries within the first year i was president absolutely positively no
9180220 my impression is he thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany ive seen zero evidence of that
9180221 i have a lifetime of experience i will bring to the white house i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he made in 2002
9180222 heres the way to look at mccain picking sarah palin as his running mate hillary clinton has been replaced by the other woman again
9180223 milking every possible drop of advantage from that unfortunate experience in his military life
9180224 he is feeling better today he started fasting from this morning 7 a m and he will continue till evening the doctors say that there is nothing to worry about
9180225 it will be decided after monday whether he stays in the hospital or he moves to a hotel or he moves to dharamsala
9180226 put concerted non violent efforts to bring a natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet

9180235 this measure will certainly increase the return but it is a process that will take time because people want to see first how it turns out
9180236 iraqi forces will be on alert from september 2 to evacuate the homes of the displaced families
9180237 i do not expect people to return in large numbers but it is certainly a positive step because one of the main concerns of these people is that others are occupying their homes
9180238 seventy percent of the occupied public buildings are held by militias
9180239 it is not just people who are occupying in some regions the militias took control of whole districts and leased it to refugees
9180240 there are terrorist groups who do not want the families to return and are preventing them from doing so the government and the army are closely tracking such cases

9180305 daarna kreeg ik de wildste gedachten ik dacht met dit geld hoef ik nooit meer te werken
9180306 stel dat het wel gelukt was dan had ik hier niet meer gezeten had je me waarschijnlijk moeten bellen in het braziliaanse sao paulo waar ik een paar maanden heb gestudeerd
9180307 ik baalde dan ook als een stekker toen rabobank site de volgende dag gewoon de juiste koers liet zien mijn turbos waren nog maar een paar honderd euro waard van een telefoontje naar de bank werd ik niet veel wijzer een fout in het script van de koers zeiden ze

9180392 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9180393 the rest of the world has caught up i dont see the at amp ts and sprints making the investments because they see internet service as a commodity
9180394 suppose the internet was entirely confined to the u s which it once was that wasnt helpful
9180395 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9180396 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us
9180397 since passage of the patriot act many companies based outside of the united states have been reluctant to store client information in the u s
9180398 there is an ongoing concern that u s intelligence agencies will gather this information without legal process there is particular sensitivity about access to financial information as well as communications and internet traffic that goes through u s switches
9180399 its no different than any other infrastructure that a country needs
9180400 are on a rampage to build out across india and china so they have alternative routes and so they dont have to route through the u s
9180401 we discovered the internet but we couldnt keep it a secret
9180402 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9180403 this win belongs to the players they faced a great team such olympiakos and came out as winners if you asked me these players won the champions league today
9180404 criticism goes with what we do and if you dwell on it then it pulls you down in the end
9180405 theres not an issue with ivan and myself there never has been
9180406 ive employed him three different times when hes come back from reserve grade coach or state league and then as my assistant coach
9180407 ivans been more than capable hes be very good hes a good coach
9180408 the olympics are over the cowboys arent in the finals the titans arent doing real good the lions arent doing real good theyve been beaten up all year so lets go back to good old reliable broncos well find something there
9180409 thats the reality if you beat yourself up over it nobody cares they just write another story tomorrow and you move on
9180410 you take a thousand photos here and you find in 999 of them im standing there doing nothing
9180411 but you find one and you think oh ill use that one to glorify your point
9180412 thats the thing about him each year hes getting older but hes still playing like hes 20 years old
9180413 hes a player that technically is very good and hes smart on the ball as well
9180414 so while his legs may not carry him the way they used to he makes up for it in a million other ways
9180415 and hes good to have on the park in terms of leadership as well he really helps the young boys along
9180416 when youre obviously playing alongside quality players like that it definitely helps you
9180417 theyre brilliant players so being up there alongside them things worked well
9180418 but weve got to build on that and make sure we continue to keep that happening and continue the same sort of performance
9180419 its always going to be tough and teams are going to try and find out ways to try and stop you so we need to make sure we carry that on
9180420 things have started to click pretty quickly but hopefully it continues to grow and get stronger
9180421 it allows you to come up with more shorter term targets targets we had three games before this break and weve set ourselves the target of at least seven points
9180422 perth played pretty attacking football last week they played well and scored a few goals in their 3 3 draw with newcastle but they are a different prospect away from home
9180423 theyre really going to make it hard for us and look to get us on the counter attack so weve got to be wary of that because they are a good team and do have a lot of good players
9180424 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off
9180425 i always had to chase the rhythm of playing on that particular surface that i was wanting to play on

9180433 e puliscono la cittadella medievale per il resto dellanno siamo abbandonati a noi stessi da otto mesi abbiamo chiesto al sindaco un incontro ma non ne abbiamo saputo nulla non chiedevamo nulla di particolare solo un p di pulizia e di attenzione seria per un monumento unico nel suo genere ma pare che il comune abbia altri interessi
9180434 nel nome della pace sia il sindaco di tutti faccia dunque il suo dovere e scenda in campo dando per primo lesempio di civilt o altrimenti faccia un passo indietro e se ne vada a casa con doveroso rispetto la saluto
9180435 we have greatly reduced our expense structure in the u
9180436 i am pleased with our performance and remain very optimistic about the third and fourth quarters which are normally very busy times for us and we will also be launching most of our new business into the marketplace during this time our team is working very hard to bring clearly canadian back to ebitda profitability in 2009

9180439 combining our two companies extends our base of operations further increases our competitiveness in the world market and affords us a strong platform to approach new markets

9180455 everything was going quite well in the morning but i struggled a little bit in the afternoon session
9180456 the bike i had the quickest time on this morning didnt work in the afternoon
9180457 this weather is a lot better for going to the beach than to the race track
9180458 but its better like this than at other races where we always have a lot of rain
9180459 i did a good job in qualifying second position is good for tomorrow i had a problem in the second sector in some corners i wasnt fast enough
9180460 but i have done some good work on the set up and hope tomorrow i hope ill be faster
9180461 to beat stoner tomorrow will be difficult my aim is to finish in the top five
9180462 it was very clear from the beginning that we did not want to make some kind of cause documentary thats a genre like everything is going to be okay and here are the heroes
9180463 they msf doctors dont view themselves like that they are humans they are doing quite extraordinary stuff in crazy situations but it would be disingenuous to the actual reality of the situation to turn it into one of those standard cliches
9180464 this is low grade medicine the things that we do are not as good as they could be
9180465 i was completely burnt out dreaming about burned bodies and dying people i had trouble in my personal life maintaining my relationships i was becoming aggressive
9180466 they are desperate because of defeats along the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9180467 there was big sound and people screamed and ran in all directions i saw several people covered with blood lying on the ground
9180468 the mccain campaign has copies of the letter and we have had conversations with them
9180469 the obama letter was circulated by the ufw two weeks before we received it
9180470 we need to inspire union members to actively support the employee free choice act
9180471 we need them fired up and ready to take to the streets if thats what it takes that is why we have initiated the million member mobilization to gather one million signatures supporting the law
9180472 some 60 million workers say they would join a union if they could
9180473 would require companies to recognize a union without a private election once organizers collect union cards signed by a majority
9180474 the employee free choice act would strip workers of their fundamental rights and leave them more vulnerable to pressure than before
9180475 it appeared to me that whatever lower level staffer put a signature stamp on the letter and sent it out did not have any idea what was going on or simply responded to a ufw request
9180476 union campaign contributions have obviously had an effect on the obama campaign
9180477 the union uses everything they can to pressure us in all honesty we didnt take the letter very seriously at all
9180478 so far we havent had any response to our invitation
9180479 if the card count is included to me that would be alarming unless there are protections built in for both employees and employers
9180480 the general policy of the airline division is to file for a representation election only after receiving a 65 percent card return from the eligible voters in a group
9180481 have 70 75 percent of members sign cards if unable to reach this goal review plan
9180482 unions know that card check does not reveal employees free choice
9180483 workers reject card checks favor private ballots in union organizing
9180484 unite here picks hilton as target for hotel workers rising campaign
9180485 not so big labor enlists new methods for greater leverage
9180486 we do not take lightly the fact that we have recommended a strike
9180487 we are focused entirely on helping the machinists understand the offer
9180488 we hope our employees recognize the benefits of our best and final offer
9180489 every three years we have to fight for our pensions and we have to fight for our medical benefits its just getting tiring
9180490 both sides to settle through the good faith bargaining process
9180491 i feel very uncomfortable telling someone they have to pay money to someone
9180492 i didnt pick labor day as the first day of the republican convention it wasnt my choice it was their choice
9180493 they probably didnt even realize it was labor day when they picked it but since the world is going to have a spotlight on the republicans we want the spotlight to be shared with us and our values and our work
9180494 in these difficult economic times for the airline industry and for hard working angelenos at the airport we must come together to find a solution that meets the needs of workers and the airline industry
9180495 i am urging the workers and contractors with the support of the airlines to come to a fair agreement that ensures quality services and keeps passengers moving safely and efficiently at the international gateway to southern california
9180496 the employee free choice act would change the way unions target small businesses
9180497 efca changes that and they would become targets of union organizers
9180498 unions would have everything to gain and nothing to lose
9180499 if the bill passes unions get much greater strength and employers especially small businesses could possibly lose control of their businesses before they even know the threat exists
9180500 this bill also calls for more penalties on employers and none on unions
9180501 employees are on an uneven playing field from the first moment they begin exploring whether they want to form a union and the will of the majority often is crushed by brutal management tactics
9180502 that could change with this election so employers need to be aware of this potentially harmful piece of legislation
9180503 when schoolchildren start paying union dues thats when ill start representing the interests of schoolchildren
9180504 to reorder the priorities of the united states of america
9180505 requires the union to agree to wiggss designation of an organization to receive her alternative dues payments once she proves the designated organization is both nonreligious and a charity wiggs met her burden of proof
9180506 we find that the examiners decision accurately states the law where a union agrees that an employees closely held religious beliefs qualify that employee to assert his or her right of non association as long as the employee designates a qualified non religious charity there is no legal issue for the commission to adjudicate accordingly we affirm the examiners decision
9180507 the union cannot exercise veto power over a teachers legitimate choice susan selected this charity because of her interest in rescuing children from exploitation unfortunately shes had to fight her own union for three years to send her money to this charity
9180508 i think i have signed up at least 1 500 voters
9180509 if people do honest work we will keep them on staff working
9180510 we ask that they work hard enough to be able to register 20 people per day but we do not pay them a fee based on how many cards they get filled out
9180511 its a responsibility on acorn to make sure they are getting valid registration cards
9180512 and acorn needs to be held accountable for that and thats what we are doing now here at the board
9180513 but the issues that we are having represent less than 1 1000 of the people that weve registered this year
9180514 is very clearly a partner that you not only cant trust but is clearly misrepresenting the facts
9180515 youve a fever of 107 jesus christ come on jump into the shower and ill cool you down
9180516 uhhh i feel strange my heads all fuzzy and my ears have popped i think im coming down with a cold ill have to skip work today i think
9180517 oh no you poor thing come here and let me feel your forehead
9180518 youre fine you big faker theres nothing wrong with you at all go on out to work with you and stop being a big hypochondriac
9180519 i dont think the union could get us more than we have not here anyway
9180520 i am in agreement with unions at certain other retail outlets they do need it but over here no
9180521 there are a lot of people that are starting to de unionize too but you dont hear too much about it
9180522 the unions dont advertise it and a lot of other companies are scared to advertise that theyre de unionizing because it is a unionized town theyre afraid that if they advertise that they might lose business
9180523 you meet the working class salesperson but he takes on the air of the customer and if anything hes somewhat a little haughty when you ask that person do you need a union he says no but when you look at what would truly be in his individual self interest he might well need a union but he doesnt see that because hes taken the ethos and the culture that the organization has put forward
9180524 employees increasingly see themselves as free agents who decide who theyre going to sell their service to
9180525 i think youre going to see a lot of growth in unionization
9180526 there are advantages to acting collectively and our employers for the last eight years have done pretty good and workers that arent in a union are seeing that they havent got their share of that prosperity
9180527 if your dear heart is wounded my wild heart bleeds with yours in the rapture of my enormous humiliation i live in your warm life and you shall die die sweetly die into mine listen de world

9180571 i am very proud of all the people who have supported me and i feel even more hate for this tyranny
9180572 want to teach me a lesson every chance they get
9180573 there were a lot of repercussions and they were very afraid

9180579 throughout my career ive been a consistent and strong supporter of reproductive justice and have consistently had a 100 pro choice rating with planned parenthood and naral pro choice america
9180580 when south dakota passed a law banning all abortions in a direct effort to have roe overruled i was the only candidate for president to raise money to help the citizens of south dakota repeal that law
9180581 moreover i believe in and have supported common sense solutions like increasing access to affordable birth control to help prevent unintended pregnancies
9180582 but we also know that roe v wade is about more than a womans right to choose its about equality its about whether our daughters are going to have the same opportunities as our sons and so to truly honor that decision we need to update the social contract so that women can free themselves and their children from violent relationships so that a mom can stay home with a sick child without getting a pink slip so that she can go to work knowing that theres affordable quality childcare for her children and so that the american dream is within reach for every family in this country this anniversary reminds us that its not enough to protect the gains of the past we have to build a future thats filled with hope and possibility for all americans

9180684 we are facing a profound economic downturn along with every other country in the world
9180685 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9180686 all my colleagues the prime minister every single one of us are focused on one single thing that is helping people helping the economy go through what is a very difficult time
9180687 i think it is important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9180688 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9180689 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9180690 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9180691 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9180692 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression

9180700 katrina hasnt been explored in film and hasnt been explored enough in general
9180701 so i think no matter what even if its a few people going to the theaters they will at least get part of the message of what the travesty was when that hurricane came through the city and then have to look at themselves and their government about what it means to leave people abandoned when the earth itself struck against them
9180702 i want it to be true authentic greatly for the people of new orleans who have experienced this
9180703 more importantly for the people of the country and the world to understand this
9180704 i couldnt help but think about the moment i first saw it and the movement of that
9180705 and maybe this is personal in a way scott reminds me of my brother they walked alike they look alike physically and my brothers passed on
9180706 every time i see it theres something else that hits me in some sort of way
9180707 we have to begin to re educate ourselves about the kind of cultural work we want to be doing and the kind of change we want
9180708 i see this film as a platform i want it to be an issue this election season
9180709 its just a beautiful documentary it just captures everything about life
9180710 we had no story we had no actors we had no locations we had nothing
9180711 all i was told was we had to do one 15 minute film on hope the first thing i thought of the first thing that popped to mind was katrina
9180712 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

9180714 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9180715 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9180716 its not going to change its not a family show
9180717 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are

9180726 i dont think hard core democrats are going to go for that
9180727 the energy is high just because people are pleased with the attention it brings to alaska especially rural alaska
9180728 ive always been a fan of hers her speech this morning was out of this world shes so eloquent
9180729 it will be good for alaska because people always have this mentality that alaska is not part of the united states
9180730 i would have liked to see an obama palin ticket
9180731 shes a tremendous governor i would hate to lose her as governor
9180732 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot
9180733 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night

9180794 we are facing a profound economic downturn along with every other country in the world
9180795 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9180796 all my colleagues the prime minister every single one of us are focused on one single thing that is helping people helping the economy go through what is a very difficult time
9180797 i think it is important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9180798 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9180799 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9180800 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9180801 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas
9180802 now suddenly weve lurched into apocalypse now the return of the great depression
9180803 i wont be managing here any more than three years at the very very most without question i can assure you of that
9180804 i know i would find it hard to give up managing united i cant do it not at the moment anyway my wife cathy was the one who talked me out of retiring last time but she wouldnt do that now its when you have to think about time for yourself i think my wife deserves a bit of my time too
9180805 that is probably one of the avenues but that is maybe for just 30 or 40 days a year
9180806 it will happen in some shape or form i hope so i have a good relationship with the club
9180807 the big fear about retirement is what do you do with yourself
9180808 there are too many cases of people who retire and end up in a box soon afterwards because they have lost the very thing that keeps them alive what i would like to do is travel to places i have never been to i would love to go to the states and spend three or four months there but that is only one year you can only do that once you can only go to australia once you dont go every year what youre left with is the time when you wake up at six oclock in the morning and you go to get out of bed and you say to yourself im finished thats the hard part
9180809 now im back at united the plan is to try to force my way into the first team
9180810 im going to continue to work hard and try to do enough to stay here and go on from there
9180811 weve put a 7m bid on the table to manchester united
9180812 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring him to the football club theyll be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club

9180822 i then said to him i dont care about god bless america i just need to use the bathroom as soon as i said that he immediately pinned my arm behind my back
9180823 he shoved me out the front gate and told me get out of their country if i didnt like it
9180824 because they are enforcing a rule of that imposes political correctness through refusing to let somebody go to bathroom while a patriotic song is playing that violates constitutional rights

9180828 weve put a 7million bid on the table to manchester united
9180829 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian
9180830 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9180831 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9180832 there will be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves
9180833 she wouldnt have articulated one coherent policy and people would just be fawning all over her
9180834 tony and i looked at each other and it was like this isnt about policy or alaska issues this is about peoples most basic instincts i like you and you make me feel good
9180835 it speaks volumes about her personally and about how she walked her talk
9180836 the course was flat which made it go by fast
9180837 you should also add a sticker of something particularly innocuous into one of the blank spaces like
9180838 whats the big deal this approach worked out for the titanic just fine

9180842 i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
9180843 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
9180844 why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it
9180845 starting oct 1 residential high speed internet customers will be limited to 250 gigabytes of traffic a month typical customers use between two gigabytes and three gigabytes a month comcast spokeswoman jen khoury said
9180846 news about the upcoming 250 gb monthly cap for comcast data subscribers left some questions unanswered i shot a few of my own as well as some from readers over to comcast to get them answered these are mostly items that did not appear in both the post about the amendment or the otherwise comprehensive faq page
9180847 the company acknowledged it has been evaluating a specific monthly data usage or bandwidth threshold for its comcast high speed internet residential customers for some time

9180852 all cpa firms offer accounting and tax services to business owners
9180853 we wanted to specialize strictly in a service not generally offered by other cpa firms something that business owners really need we determined that selling businesses is a perfect fit for our cpa experience and background
9180854 most business owners have never before sold a business and they know very little about selling their businesses for the most money a majority of business brokers and intermediaries just dont understand the accounting tax and financial concepts involved in maximizing a businesses value
9180855 during my years as a practicing cpa i helped negotiate and structure hundreds of business deals and i was always amazed at how little some business brokers and intermediaries knew about business financial matters
9180856 my goal is to educate business owners so they can prepare their businesses to bring the highest price when the time comes for them to sell
9180857 we are advising british citizens to exercise caution avoiding areas with demonstrations or large gatherings of people
9180858 we also understand the airport in phuket is closed as a result of further demonstrations british citizens should avoid the airport areas
9180859 any british citizens intending to travel via any of these airports should contact their tour operator
9180860 im currently stuck in krabi southern thailand i have a flight out of bangkok tonight but as the airport and now rail links have been taken over by the pad protest group peoples alliance for democracy it seems unlikely i will be able to catch the flight
9180861 i have been in krabi airport this morning and the atmosphere was one of quiet celebration i at no time felt threatened or uneasy and the protestors actually apologised for the inconvenience
9180862 it was very eerie though to see a busy airport reduced to an empty building with no planes in sight and a group of protestors huddled on the runway under the shade of some boarding stairs

9180874 i dont see mcmc as an independent body especially when they are acting in the interest of the government this will just make people speculate that they are under the direct control of the government
9180875 however if mcmc decided to take this banning trend to another level banning political blogs i can claim immunity as a parliamentarian and i will speak up for other bloggers
9180876 michelle gunaselan an editor for projectmalaysia an online journal said the ban was unhealthy
9180877 when you block a socio political site with thousands of visits daily you are sending out a message you dont encourage discussions more so when it runs opinions contrary to what appears in mainstream media
9180878 we must fight for the world as it should be a world where we work together to reverse discriminatory laws
9180879 sarah palin ten ways in which she is a republican
9180880 so this is the good kind of politics happening over there huh
9180881 she does not support real science and the separation of church and state
9180882 if you consistently rob peter to pay paul you solidify you can always count on pauls vote
9180883 how is she considered in bed with big oil when she helped pass a tax increase on oil company profits

9180886 the wind was a little nerve wracking the howling but it turned out ok
9180887 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9180888 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9180889 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9180890 its a risk but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9180891 there should be a simple easily implementable kernel to the lisp that

9180894 to be nationally recognized as having three of those businesses located here in gilbert sends a message that were a great place to do business and were a growing thriving community
9180895 were on a mission to revolutionize the way small businesses grow
9180896 every executive here has owned their own business so they now what its like to run a business
9180897 it makes a lot of sense its a very family oriented business so a lot of employees live here in gilbert
9180898 obviously were growing in the midst of a bad economy
9180899 im encouraged and real optimistic about the company because the future of the arizona construction industry
9180900 if people are laid off if theyre white collar they have a severance package or 401 k and they look at franchising as a good opportunity to use those resources and invest in a business for themselves
9180901 the whole concept of franchising is you get the benefits of a national brand the marketing the training and the advertising support that you wouldnt have if you were to start up your own business
9180902 franchise businesses historically fare pretty well in good economic times but also in slower economic times
9180903 i know there are many people in the restaurant business struggling but our same store sales are positive over last year we think that people are trading down to our brand because its a quick serve
9180904 some people are going to lose their job in a tough economy and theyre not going to be able to go but then you also have those who trade down from casual dining to quick serve and that can keep you going
9180905 in a down economy this is an opportunity for people who worked all their lives
9180906 they just really want to break free of the big corporate environment and take their career into their own hands and so what we see when there is a dip in the economy is applications on franchising rise
9180907 we think of low income people as those hit by foreclosures but its really all people who extended their income people who stretched themselves too heavily
9180908 tolleson especially was very susceptible to investors coming in they were banking on the appreciation of homes
9180909 but when the markets fell apart a lot of them got caught holding homes that had a lot less market value than when they had purchased them
9180910 southwest valley cities were hit a lot harder because a lot of the new homes built in 2002 through 2005 were bought by new homeowners that got caught up in subprime loans
9180911 in goodyear 60 to 70 percent of homes are bank owned
9180912 i also know that based on statistics from coldwell banker close to 75 percent of the homes we sold last month and we had a good month were bank owned properties sales are up sure but prices are way down
9180913 we have to raise the fees but people cant afford the higher fees
9180914 its something people dont think about when they think about foreclosures
9180915 why would you rent so far out and not somewhere closer where youre not spending so much time on the freeway and so much money on gasoline
9180916 what were trying to do is see why this was done
9180917 and to see if theres other funding available in the state
9180918 the obvious burden to local agencies is that we were informed of this expense after our new budgets have been finalized and so none of us budgeted for it
9180919 of course we are going through rough times with all the foreclosures in our neighborhood but we are determined to stay on top of this crisis
9180920 the board has been actively involved with bank owned properties and has helped preserve the value of the neighborhood while maintaining the front landscaping sometimes even pulling weeds ourselves in front of neighboring homes going through foreclosure
9180921 gateway village is more than a neighborhood its a community and this community has become in time an extended family
9180922 moving from missouri to arizona was both exciting and scary with two small children we wanted a place where we really felt at home and gateway village has been just that from the neighborhood pool parties to the movie nights on the lawn it is a great neighborhood to be part of i know all my neighbors by name and our children play together its very comforting i recommend gateway village to anyone looking for a family atmosphere
9180923 it has a perfect location near the 202 and within walking distance from school shopping and restaurants
9180924 its close enough to the city and when i leave the city and come home it is nice quiet and cooler here the community itself is peaceful yet involved with their neighbors and caring for the newcomers there is a sense of pride in the community itself the neighborhood is safe for young people we have a policeman and a fireman living in our community and a block watch group that keeps us attuned to whats happening in and around us i truly enjoy living here and recommend it to others looking for a quality community in which to live
9180925 with money magazine rating gilbert in the 28 best places to live its no surprise people are starting to look closer at gateway village the location is unbeatable we are minutes from santan shopping mall and it offers homeowners great value with home prices and hoa fees that are more affordable than other communities with similar luxuries
9180926 we were pregnant with our first child and were looking for a neighborhood with other young families it is a great place to raise our children there are great community amenities and activities year round
9180927 6 1 2 1 4 the for as equals then subclause
9180928 in the for as equals then subclause the for or as construct initializes the variable var by setting it to the result of evaluating form1 on the first iteration then setting it to the result of evaluating form2 on the second and subsequent iterations if form2 is omitted the construct uses form1 on the second and subsequent iterations the loop keywords and then serve as valid prepositions in this syntax this construct does not provide any termination tests
9180929 6 1 2 1 2 the for as in list subclause
9180930 in the for as in list subclause the for or as construct iterates over the contents of a list it checks for the end of the list as if by using endp the variable var is bound to the successive elements of the list in form1 before each iteration at the end of each iteration the function step fun is applied to the list the default value for step fun is cdr the loop keywords in and by serve as valid prepositions in this syntax the for or as construct causes termination when the end of the list is reached
9180931 with the exceptions listed below clauses are executed in the loop body in the order in which they appear in the source execution is repeated until a clause terminates the loop or until a return go or throw form is encountered which transfers control to a point outside of the loop the following actions are exceptions to the linear order of execution all variables are initialized first regardless of where the establishing clauses appear in the source the order of initialization follows the order of these clauses
9180932 the for and as clauses iterate by using one or more local loop variables that are initialized to some value and that can be modified or stepped 1 after each iteration for these clauses iteration terminates when a local variable reaches some supplied value or when some other loop clause terminates iteration
9180933 oh cripes my bad what a tard sorry for the noise
9180934 implementations can interleave the setting of initial values with the bindings however the assignment of the initial values is always calculated in the order specified by the user a variable is thus sometimes bound to a meaningless value of the correct type and then later in the prologue it is set to the true initial value by using setq one implication of this interleaving is that it is implementation dependent whether the lexical environment in which the initial value forms variously called the form1 form2 form3 step fun vector hash table and package in any for as subclause except for as equals then are evaluated includes only the loop variables preceding that form or includes more or all of the loop variables the form1 and form2 in a for as equals then form includes the lexical environment of all the loop variables
9180935 before the first iteration all the init forms are evaluated and each var is bound to the value of its respective init form if supplied this is a binding not an assignment when the loop terminates the old values of those variables will be restored for do all of the init forms are evaluated before any var is bound
9180936 perform termination tests generally just before the execution of the loop body

9180947 synchroniciteit is niet raadselachtiger of geheimzinniger dan de discontinu teiten in de fysica het is slechts de vastgeroeste overtuiging van de almacht van de causaliteit die het verstand moeilijkheden bereidt en die het ondenkbaar doet schijnen dat er oorzaakloze gebeurtenissen zouden kunnen voorkomen of bestaan zinvolle co ncidenties zijn denkbaar als zuivere toevalligheden maar naarmate hun aantal toeneemt en de overeenkomst groter en nauwkeuriger is wordt het steeds minder waarschijnlijk en meer ondenkbaar dat hier sprake van toeval is dat wil zeggen ze kunnen niet meer voor zuiver toeval doorgaan maar moeten bij gebrek aan causale verklaringen als ordeningen volgens een bepaald plan opgevat worden hun gebrek aan verklaarbaarheid bestaat niet alleen uit het feit dat de oorzaak onbekend is maar ook uit het feit dat zon oorzaak met onze verstandelijke capaciteiten niet denkbaar is

9180956 but i remember when my fathers still up there running i had to be out there with water and stuff see young ladies that wasnt over seventeen eighteen years up there with a man my age now drunk and theyd have to sober them up and give them black coffee to get them home to cook their husbands supper oh something like that i said i this was my remarked sic then theyre not worth a good clean bullet to kill them with it thats right and i hated women thats right and i just have to watch every move now to keep from still thinking the same thing
9180957 you can think about life and about what youre doing and get your thoughts together
9180958 dude it looks like its going to be an easy season
9180959 this clean limitless energy resource will make an important positive difference in our environment and help meet the mayors goal for a greener new york by the year 2030
9180960 fresh kills is the only site in the city that has been tested and proven suitable for a wind farm
9180961 it looked kind of weird when i saw it in another state
9180962 but its good if its going to save people money and benefit the environment
9180963 we have to find alternative energy and if it helps then im all for it
9180964 i would prefer they do the ones under the water but what are you going to do weve already got all these cell phone towers out here to look at
9180965 look at new jersey they want to turn the whole new jersey turnpike over and do that can you imagine how much oil and gas we could cut back on
9180966 i dont know what theyre going to be using the landfill for ive heard rumors of a park among other things to actually be getting something there that would be great
9180967 personally ild rather have a large patch of parkland there bigger than central park with ponds and lakes and boating and trails
9180968 because i doubt the wind farm is really going to save everyday people money
9180969 private companies would compete for a lease to develop a wind farm at their own expense
9180970 all that is needed is for the city to begin the process
9180971 the middle class people are always going to pay no matter what
9180972 its just my opinion but i think somehow its going to start to lower prices and then theyll come right back up to the same place they were
9180973 ild like them to start drilling oil offshore creating jobs in the process rather than just giving money to all the politicians and big corporations
9180974 i have spent many summers getting in the car and driving to the jersey shore
9180975 this summer with the gas prices we realized we have great beaches here that could have more restaurants and rides and could become more of a tourist draw
9180976 i look at the houses along arthur kill road and i want to take an eraser and erase those oil plants and give them something more beautiful to look at
9180977 id like to improve parking at the ferry id like to have our own aquarium on staten island and we could go back to our roots of being a place for summer vacations to chill and commune with nature staten island is gorgeous and we as staten islanders have a really unique situation

9180981 there are thousands of villages in the world that have no school no clinic no business no government but they have a church what would happen if we could mobilize churches to address those five global giants
9180982 the future of the world is not secularism but religious pluralism
9180983 we cannot solve these problems without involving people of faith and their religious institutions it isnt going to happen any other way on this planet there are about 20 million jews there are about 600 million buddhists there are about 800 million hindus there are over 1 billion muslims and there are 2 3 billion christians if you take people of faith out of the equation you have ruled out five sixths of the world and if we only leave it up to secular people to solve these major problems it isnt going to happen
9180984 whos the man of peace in any village or it might be a woman of peace who has the most respect they dont have to be christian in fact they could be muslim but theyre open and theyre influential and you work with them to attack the five giants to which he has added global warming
9180985 i get it rick houses of worship are the distribution centers for all we need to do
9180986 there are some religious leaders in different religious faiths who in seeking to affirm their own faith and its authenticity and legitimacy deny other people their faith with its legitimacy and authenticity i dont think we can keep going like this without spawning the kind of hatred we are all here to try and solve i think its up to us to hold the clergys feet to the fire of whatever faith that we insist that we affirm what is beautiful in our own traditions while at the same time refusing to denigrate other faith traditions by suggesting that they are illegitimate or consigned to some kind of evil end
9180987 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name jesus christ under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
9180988 yes but they are a massive volunteer force and distribution outlet of resources for slaying the giants of world suffering
9180989 by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
9180990 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9180991 for our conversation citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ
9180992 god didnt go to all the trouble of sending his son merely to point an accusing finger telling the world how bad it was he came to help to put the world right again
9180993 salvation is the entire universe being brought back into harmony with its maker this has huge implications for how people present the message of jesus yes jesus can come into our hearts but we can join a movement that is as wide and as big as the universe itself rocks and trees and birds and swamps and ecosystems gods desire is to restore all of it the goal isnt escaping this world but making this world the kind of place god can come to and god is remaking us into the kind of people who can do this kind of work
9180994 i think our future will also require us to join humbly and charitably with people of other faiths muslim hindu buddhist jewish secularists and others in pursuit of peace environmental stewardship and justice for all people things that matter greatly to the heart of god
9180995 this world the kind of place god can come to
9180996 when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth

9181119 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9181120 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9181121 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9181122 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9181123 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9181124 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9181125 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9181126 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9181127 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9181128 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9181129 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9181130 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9181131 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9181132 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9181133 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9181134 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9181135 its going to be a whole new life for us im going to learn to relax and sleep late bake apple pies get into quilts were going to be just like the farmer in the dell
9181136 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9181137 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9181138 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9181139 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9181140 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9181141 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9181142 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9181143 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9181144 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9181145 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9181146 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9181147 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9181148 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9181149 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9181150 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9181151 who are open to doing something on the production side
9181152 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9181153 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9181154 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9181155 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9181156 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9181157 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9181158 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9181159 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9181160 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9181161 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9181162 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9181163 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9181164 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9181165 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9181166 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9181167 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9181168 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9181169 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9181170 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9181171 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9181172 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9181173 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9181174 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9181175 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9181176 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9181177 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9181178 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9181179 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9181180 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9181181 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9181182 den h r stormen riskerar att bli v ldigt farlig

9181184 pias a doll we had a ball we would hang out and have dinner and drinks she makes a mean pasta

9181186 i often play the younger girl or the ingenue so it was good to play a woman coming into her own i love the aspect of the femme fatale and i loved that she was this impeccable poised woman who had such status that was really cool
9181187 the great thing about acting is you do this research on life or things people go through or historical stuff that you would not know about before whether its the 1920s or whether its the iliad or researching post traumatic stress whatever it is it transports you into these different worlds of research so i was really happy to read up on it
9181188 and when ive gotten older ive really always admired all the girls from australia who have done so well nicole kidman cate blanchett rachel griffiths toni collette miranda otto frances oconnor theres so many ive always admired them
9181189 i dont feel like ive arrived anywhere in particular i still feel like im figuring out life i didnt get the manual
9181190 its been fine i was in australia for six months and hes here now
9181191 it was just those first few years when i was away all the time but now were pretty regular we did a few readings together last year at the sydney theatre company which was fun but its been hard now with doing damages it kind of swallows up half the year so now weve got six months to figure out what i can do
9181192 i love manhattan because its so fresh its just intense and the street life is incomparable there are different scenes on every block you walk along its such an entertaining place and the characters here are larger than life new yorkers are so proud of their city i feel lucky
9181193 im kind of shy im not that confident a person
9181194 its a weird dynamic its like youre expected to be extremely vulnerable and in touch with all your feelings but yet you have to be made of this really thick skin because you can get broken after 100 rejections and one job so its a very strange thing that it asks of you
9181195 and sometimes you succeed and sometimes people turn to other stuff whether its religion or drugs or sex or reading you have to learn how to cope everyone turns to different things in their life as actors
9181196 im pretty ill equipped i have to admit i usually ring up my mum crying
9181197 its just great to be busy so as long as im busy i dont care where i am
9181198 and new york is such an awesome place to work its one of the reasons i really wanted to do the job to be able to live and work in manhattan is always something i dreamt of doing
9181199 theyve done some research on the local criminals and gold coast identities the loan shark and surfing legend had something familiar about them
9181200 the male police lead is splitting with his wife and the female detective is someone who is cynical on life and love a realist those personalities exist in the job
9181201 there is the unrealistic side to the show like everyone walking through crime scenes that just doesnt happen in real life but if it was like real life it wouldnt be interesting
9181202 the surfboard kept in the cops office was a bit far fetched it would be kept in the locker room
9181203 it was dark and i was nearly expecting to see tumbleweeds on the streets
9181204 it was kind of ironic at this stage of my life that i worked in a country that has more than 400 beers
9181205 but i found my bed more tempting they were long days
9181206 and i did alexander 2004 so i know what horse piss tastes like
9181207 when i first read the script it was laugh out loud stuff and its not often you laugh out loud on your own reading something
9181208 but during the rehearsals we got inured to the comedy and regardless of how comedic the piece seems on the surface and how funny some of the interactions are theres an enormous amount of tragedy and pain and absolute despondency underneath nearly every single line
9181209 i was 22 or 23 years young and didnt know why or what or who or how or when i enjoyed it but then i stopped enjoying it i just got sick of myself
9181210 the journey got a little bit out of hand for me personally so i just stepped back ive definitely quietened down but ive done it selfishly because it suits me i just want a little bit of peace
9181211 i try to make sure they dont keep me up at night and they dont come between me and living in the present whatever that present may be but yes there are a couple of things ive been part of that i regret a little bit
9181212 if youre part of something and somebody gets hurt you always regret it
9181213 some of the best things that happen to you in life are unplanned and thats what my son is best thing thats ever happened to me
9181214 once deemed such a glorious thing is way down there in the pecking order
9181215 i needed to get back to work otherwise i might have started doing karaoke
9181216 its a really nice piece and its got incredible performances from ed norton and jon voight
9181217 it was dark and i was nearly expecting to see tumbleweeds on the streets
9181218 im crying mommy neban cry for noah and i crying just like neban
9181219 let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9181220 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful
9181221 if it can go wrong it will expect the worst
9181222 it might not be a serious issue we will look but if its just the battery we wont charge you for the diagnosis
9181223 white guy specials and you will have a great meal basically like really good thai not super authentic but quality ingredients and good flavors nothing like it in st joseph missouri yelp aholic t
9181224 ive never had a sit down meal here but when i used to work in downtown berkeley my coworkers and i would take an 11 am tally of who
9181225 wait wait i dont speak cambodian just give me the number

9181232 youve heard of mental depression this is a mental recession
9181233 we may have a recession we havent had one yet
9181234 you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline
9181235 senator gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador to belarus although im not sure the citizens of minsk would welcome that
9181236 over the last several weeks myself included weve been pressing a little bit to score runs i hope we can get this momentum and keep going its nice to be on this side of a game like this
9181237 those are probably the best 3 and 4 hitters in the league
9181238 we had good at bats they make good pitches you hit them they make bad pitches you hit them that lifts our confidence weve been fighting through some things
9181239 at this stage every game we play is going to be important
9181240 it takes you a little bit longer to get loose but ill take that every time
9181241 the offense came out scoring and never really let up
9181242 it was like quicksand the harder i tried the faster i fell i have the stuff to pitch at this level right now its a mental game i have to polish it up a little bit i have to get through this
9181243 if the dnc is a bust then the cedia will pick us up
9181244 the collapse of the agricultural industry in california and the midwest had the unexpected side benefit of eliminating illegal immigration
9181245 we noticed a first big dip in the numbers right after the greenland ice shelf collapse caused a salt water intrusion that covered much of californias central valley
9181246 i will conduct a respectful debate now it will be dispirited it will be spirited because there are stark differences i am a proud conservative liberal republica conservative republican hello easy there
9181247 inexperience i think inexperience and a lack of judgment and a record that shows that
9181248 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day

9181291 i think we all understand what a historical crucial night this is
9181292 its probably the biggest operation most of us will have in our careers
9181293 clinton did the hard work and now i can play the gender card to translate some of those votes into mccain votes
9181294 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9181295 energy production front and center in the policy debate once again
9181296 big oil extended its reach into the campaign of john mccain
9181297 shes viewed as almost anti oil shes probably pro oil from a national perspective but shes not in the pocket of big oil shes fought them at every step
9181298 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9181299 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9181300 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9181301 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9181302 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9181303 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9181304 our focus is really on this side of the river
9181305 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9181306 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9181307 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9181308 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9181309 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9181310 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9181311 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9181312 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9181313 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9181314 because both russia and norway have an interest in the development of the european oil and gas market
9181315 and we welcome them into the market because the market will be bigger if there are several suppliers
9181316 we are a reliable supplier and we have proved that over many years and we have a very transparent open energy sector
9181317 the situation is very interesting for norway of course we are looked upon as a stable nation whereas russia still has a tainted reputation in that respect so i think we will try to prove that we are a stable producer of oil and gas for europe
9181318 the ukraine issue sent a shiver down the european energy spine and georgia is a recent episode which will focus a lot of minds
9181319 i think we have to be how can i put it streetwise when it comes to issues around energy security norway is a great partner to have its a very sophisticated democracy with a great record when it comes to human rights so the new pipeline is a good piece of democratic politics
9181320 the public small craft users and local fisherman are urged to be aware of the risks that these logs pose to fishing boats bathers and recreational surfers
9181321 they should not be approached in the surf zone and life guards are urged to maintain a lookout and warn bathers of their presence
9181322 there is an increased risk posed by the remaining logs due to the approaching adverse weather and extreme caution along this stretch of coast should be observed

9181327 a right to express a view on any decision by the judges both to the judges and to the public but it has not in the past nor will in the future offer any form of censure or controls within the new signatures judging process
9181328 we respect the many differing views on what is perceived to be acceptable as a supporter of the arts views may be offered on that art without it drawing into question our continued support
9181329 recognise that some members of the sasol staff as well as some members of the public may be challenged or even offended by the piece and we feel it is both responsible and appropriate that we distance sasol from the artwork
9181330 many very challenging works of art but while we support artistic integrity we also respect differing views on what is acceptable
9181331 simply have a penis in the work is something on which patriarchal society can fixate always on the minor detail which really misses the point
9181332 that young artists can go out there and get noticed
9181333 strydoms image depicts the traditional family portrait as a disturbing presence of lives halted at a particular moment the sepia shadows in strydoms work are almost phantom like and undecipherable

9181335 earlier this week we wrote a letter to the city complaining about the ill treatment we receive but we have received no response from them
9181336 we are tired of having our vehicles impounded on a daily basis for no apparent reason and the hefty fines we receive for bogus offences
9181337 we are also upset about the planned vehicle licence demerit system and are demanding that we be exempt from it
9181338 we are going to continue enforcing the law and should anyone feel aggrieved then they can take their complaints through the proper channels
9181339 there is a system in place which allows people who feel that they have been unfairly treated to lodge a complaint
9181340 lizel was only 21 and was just starting to chase her dreams its not just her life they took they took everything i lived for but if you are not important and you dont have money your case gets swept under the carpet
9181341 when i arrived at the house there were three cups one belonged to lizel and the other two showed there were two more in the house that day yet only one of the cups was taken for testing
9181342 i later handed it to them for dna testing but the results are unknown
9181343 they are too scared to get involved im not happy with this this whole thing is very strange names and addresses given to these inspectors that might have led to some information were never followed up there is no investigation
9181344 the police want to assure the family and the public that detectives will continue to do everything possible to find lizels murderer
9181345 all they say is we are doing our best or we will phone you later its just how they buy time for the people who murdered my daughter
9181346 there is no closure i never had treatment or counselling i think ive reached breaking point but what can i do lizel was my life my world my pride they her murderers ruined it it has left me very bitter im alone i lost everything while the culprits are still walking free
9181347 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
9181348 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
9181349 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter

9181355 we continue to monitor developments and have a number of plans in place to address the impact if the proposed changes are legislated
9181356 as a result we plan to carefully move to a more defensive investment asset allocation to reduce investment earnings volatility
9181357 mindful of merger and acquisition opportunities given inevitable industry consolidation
9181358 we have a strong capital position with 105 6 million in excess capital above our internal target and an ungeared balance sheet enabling us to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities as they arise and undertake capital management initiatives
9181359 as an initial step we plan to undertake a on market share buy back of up to 10 per cent of issued shares mr fitzgibbon said
9181360 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity he said
9181361 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
9181362 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets mr clarke said
9181363 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
9181364 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale he said
9181365 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
9181366 unfortunately this has required the departure of many talented employees to date and will see a further reduction in headcount by up to 50 per cent by the end of june 2009 as we accelerate our restructuring program he said
9181367 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult mr clarke said

9181373 faith is a living and unshakeable confidence a belief in the grace of god so assured that a man would die a thousand deaths for its sake

9181380 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
9181381 now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete

9181387 we are appealing for anyone who was at the address during the course of this party to come forward and make contact with the police
9181388 house to house inquiries are ongoing and there is a high visibility police presence in the area
9181389 the point of this will hopefully be that someone doesnt have to go through what we have

9181392 a beautiful flower delights and refreshes the hearts of all people equally no matter what soil it grows in that is the power of beauty the same is true of great art it is this spirit that the german poet heinrich heine sang of when he wrote that once the peapod bursts open the sugar peas inside are for everyone to enjoy
9181393 it was a pleasure to be featured on the jazz network main page
9181394 we suspect that a member of the public or persons unknown to us gained access to the roof area gathered waste material near an air conditioning duct and set fire to it in the hope the rest of the building would catch fire

9181396 yes i really agree its stupid that we dont have a plan in this business and so and so has been promising to write it for years
9181397 no im too busy i dont have time for that ive got to run my business
9181398 planning isnt about writing some ponderous homework assignment or dull business memo its about envisioning the business that you want to create it should be fascinating to you what do people want how are you going to get it to them how are you different and what do you do better than anyone else
9181399 we are going to continue with high visibility patrols tonight and as long as we perceive it to be necessary
9181400 there is a very bad situation now not only for qataris but for all arabs
9181401 you break experience up into pieces and you put them together in different combinations new combinations and some are real and some are not some are documentary and some are imagined it takes a pedestrian and literal mind to be worried about which is true and which is not true its all of it not true and its all of it true
9181402 something is new now go try to find out what it is shmuck ahhahahaha
9181403 people learn how to use the web by surfing other web sites not yours

9181405 the vessel attempted evasive maneuvering before being overpowered by the hijackers the coalition forces within the vicinity were alerted but were unable to prevent the hijacking as safety of the crew onboard is of priority
9181406 you can plan all you want to you can lie in your morning bed and fill whole notebooks with schemes and intentions but within a single afternoon within hours or minutes everything you plan and everything you have fought to make yourself can be undone as a slug is undone when salt is poured on him and right up to the moment when you find yourself dissolving into foam you can still believe you are doing fine
9181407 he didnt say too much hes a humble sort of guy but just his presence in his room everyone went up to shake his hand and it was good to see him in the sheds before everyone ran out
9181408 bedsy was obviously a factor in the game but weve done it for ourselves first and foremost it was the last home game of the year so youre expected to rip in as much as you can
9181409 its right up there with anything for me in terms of the circumstances
9181410 there was a lot of pressure on us to stay in the finals race and get the job done the boys had to handle the fact that our captain and inspirational leader retired last weekend we had disruptions with illness to a couple of our players and they just handled the lot of it not to mention a terrific footy team in melbourne
9181411 cameron smith was pouring down on him and how he got that threaded through and hit it so sweetly under pressure is an enormous thing
9181412 the messages are easy its hard to kick them in the heat of the battle
9181413 its going to be a bit of a struggle now id imagine to win the minor premiership
9181414 we just came out pretty flat tonight and failed to get into the game
9181415 obviously they were pretty determined to send danny out on a winning note and certainly that type of emotion helps a team
9181416 we started the game off extremely well and kept going to the end in good fashion
9181417 i was a little surprised that wellington didnt come out fighting after their last result loss to melbourne
9181418 he was a bit slow in the first half he had to get that first goal to get the monkey off his back
9181419 weve got to be better than that there were opportunities for players there tonight and quite frankly they didnt take them
9181420 in the united states we simply have not figured out how to fit the pieces together for a coordinated package that puts people on bikes

9181422 ill be disappointed if we dont because our performances have been fantastic especially in one day cricket
9181423 we beat the west indies 5 0 and weve come here and won convincingly today
9181424 weve got a fantastic squad weve got so much talent around australia and it doesnt matter who we play every time we walk out to play for australia we expect to win
9181425 it changes every day for our boys they can be wonderful with that minimal footwork and shot playing but they can also be ordinary
9181426 the people back home have built up this series a lot and the players felt that a bit today it looked like they werent up to it mentally
9181427 many students are bringing thousands of dollars of electronic equipment into their dorm rooms with little to no security precautions its just open season for criminals

9181435 what i obviously think is going on here is these allegations of bomb making materials are a pretext so they can get a judge to sign a warrant to allow them to invade this space and what they really want to do is confiscate every means that people have to engage in legitimate political consent

9181442 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person
9181443 i have spoken to dr haneef and he is obviously concerned that his reputation has been impugned over the last 13 months by the afp continuing to refer to him as a suspect

9181493 top flight refereeing in scotland is undoubtedly awful craig levein was very astute in his observations last season and of course received the mandatory sfa criticism the truth is though they get paid far less than their english counterparts so per theyre no worse than some of the terrible refereeing performances that grace the premiership

9181546 cameron smith was pouring down on him and how he got that threaded through and hit it so sweetly under pressure is an enormous thing
9181547 the messages are easy its hard to kick them in the heat of the battle
9181548 its going to be a bit of a struggle now id imagine to win the minor premiership
9181549 we just came out pretty flat tonight and failed to get into the game
9181550 obviously they were pretty determined to send danny out on a winning note and certainly that type of emotion helps a team
9181551 sale in small quantitie after the chaos of two world wars and the devastating great depression policymakers searched for ne onal information for 18 months
9181552 we think a lot about how to maintain our house foreign affairs committee the previous year stating it had been
9181553 the management of economic ill receive exactly what they purchase
9181554 several children some of whom couldnt sit still became engaged in abracadabras educational gaming format it offers surprises competition and rewards without comparing one student to another
9181555 abracadabra has the potential to increase the reading and writing abilities of students in the important early childhood years
9181556 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9181557 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9181558 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9181559 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9181560 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9181561 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9181562 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9181563 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9181564 our focus is really on this side of the river
9181565 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9181566 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9181567 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9181568 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9181569 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9181570 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9181571 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9181572 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9181573 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9181574 we will start moving residents from the 17 pickup areas that are located throughout the city
9181575 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9181576 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
9181577 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9181578 of all that is written i love only what a man has written with his blood write with blood and you will experience that blood in spirit
9181579 you can lead a horse to water but you cant climb a ladder with a bell in each hand
9181580 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9181581 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9181582 the revenant is a darkly humorous and thrilling tale that consistently keeps the reader laughing guessing and horrified at nearly every turn this books manages to blend the classic ghost takes revenge story idea a whodunnit mystery and plenty of action sequences into a seamless fast paced and immensely enjoyable read
9181583 this top down ultimatum delivered today stands to directly breach undertakings the company made yesterday afternoon in the australian industrial relations commission not to lock out staff who return to work on monday
9181584 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9181585 weve found other hotels for those passengers who were unable to stay on in their accommodation
9181586 there were all these traffic jams because there were mobs rioting and stuff and to get out of there we walked for a kilometre and climbed the fence to get into the airport
9181587 on the way to the airport it was a bit scary to be honest and we panicked because weve never seen real shooting guns
9181588 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9181589 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9181590 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9181591 offensives are part of the strategy of defence and if a country confines itself to its borders it has set a limit and eliminated part of its capability
9181592 in the united states we simply have not figured out how to fit the pieces together for a coordinated package that puts people on bikes
9181593 i dont want to call into question the ability or impartiality of the people appointed
9181594 however when the minister had the opportunity to appoint seven commissioners and could not find a single one from sa with the impartiality and skills to do the job it beggars belief
9181595 we have people of the calibre of professor mike young who would be eminently qualified
9181596 i recognise the system needs to be managed on a national basis and away from parochial state interests but we also have to have confidence that the grave concerns about the river system in sa are brought to the table
9181597 the role of the national water commission is to audit reform by the states whereas the new murray darling basin authority has a much more significant role in shaping the future of the basin
9181598 the government recently announced south australian robert freeman as the new head of the murray darling basin authority
9181599 requested that the priest return to the archdiocese to assist
9181600 mr abbott has been retained to conduct an inquiry into the process and procedures regarding this matter
9181601 we will place no limits on the extent of the inquiry or where mr abbott wants to go with this to address this issue in the interests of due process the archdiocese of adelaide cannot comment further
9181602 the allegations you make against fr fleming are of a very serious nature they should be investigated by the police and i would encourage you strongly to pursue your complaint with them
9181603 i was so angry that this man who had abused his power over me and had such a huge impact on my life an immediate impact had been put in a position of power again over young people
9181604 i cannot imagine how a person who has questions about their integrity can be put into such a position
9181605 i believe the catholic church must have been in contact with him because he rang me distressed about it and asked me to tell the archbishop that there was no penetration
9181606 it appeared really important to john that i advised the archbishop that we did not have intercourse i did tell the archbishop the exact relationship i had with john which involved no penetration but i didnt think it mitigated anything i recall the archbishop asking me whether he should ordain john i told him that it wasnt up to me to make that decision
9181607 the proper course is for these allegations to be investigated by the police or the church in the ordinary way
9181608 this is not the appropriate forum for him to come out with any response to the allegations
9181609 the appropriate forum is the courts or the ecclesiastical disciplinary tribunal mechanism
9181610 as archbishop of sydney cardinal pell has no jurisdiction over other dioceses or priests belonging to them
9181611 when allegations are received about priests in other dioceses complainants are encouraged to go to the police or the professional standards office in the relevant state
9181612 a copy of the complaint is also provided to the appropriate professional standards office to follow up responsibility for the selection and appointment of staff at campion college is a matter for the college which is a private institution not an official church agency and outside the sydney archdiocese
9181613 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9181614 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9181615 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9181616 i was talking to someone in childcare in queensland earlier this year
9181617 its actually child abuse its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9181618 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9181619 babies have very much higher levels of stress in childcare
9181620 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people the high flyers they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9181621 but do they realise that child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention
9181622 the trappings of the cute dresses the adorable little boys clothes the toys the beautiful nursery all of those things the child doesnt know
9181623 the child just wants to be held it wants to have attention to be the centre of a universe for a few minutes of a day at least
9181624 if parents had a choice they wouldnt go back to work with their children so young
9181625 most mothers return to work because they are not in a financially viable position to stay at home maybe we need to be looking at a national maternity leave scheme
9181626 we havent had to have babies since the 60s when people could prevent themselves from having babies quite easily without having abortions
9181627 babies are difficult they are hard work the joy that children bring is sensational just brilliant but five kids in a family thats hard on some of the kids because not everybody can have the same amount of attention
9181628 to know how it can happen in our society is astonishing
9181629 the 12 hour fasting is to overcome and ease conflict and suffering in the world and particularly for freedom and justice of the people of tibet and china

9181639 we are facing a profound economic downturn along with every other country in the world
9181640 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9181641 i think it is important that government ministers and particularly me as chancellor level with people i explained that what is happening to every country in the world ours included is that we have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen for generations
9181642 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris friday august 29 due to

9181665 our border must be secure and that the federal government has utterly failed in its responsibility to ensure that it is secure
9181666 john mccain believes that the right of law abiding citizens to keep and bear arms is a fundamental individual constitutional right that we have a sacred duty to protect
9181667 one of the greatest threats to our liberty and the constitutional framework that safeguards our freedoms are willful judges who usurp the role of the people and their representatives and legislate from the bench
9181668 broad pools of capital low taxes and incentives for research in america a commitment to a skilled and educated workforce and a dedication to opening markets around the globe
9181669 john mccain has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore

9181677 i think you just figured out why i chose joe biden
9181678 because heres a man who wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth
9181679 it was a great honor and it was a humbling experience
9181680 because i was reminded that this election is not about me its about you
9181681 they see their jobs shipped overseas theyve seen the cost of everything from healthcare to college to gas to food skyrocket even though their incomes and their wages havent gone up
9181682 john mccain just does not get what ordinary people here in beaver pa are going through
9181683 is not just what it means for them but what it means to their children or their grandchildren
9181684 you know that if we keep going the way were going

9181767 we at the jal biradari and tarun bharat sangh are organizing a very important kumbh on 6th and 7th of september in an interior village called khajura in the tehsil of sappotara in karoli district rajasthan for those water lovers who are fed up with seeing the polluting nature of normal kumbhs this kumbh would be a refreshing and an unforgettable experience friends we just want to make our people understand that the true meaning of kumbh is not to destroy the rivers but to conserve them we also want to show you how beautifully any river can be rejuvenated let us understand first of all how the tradition of gathering for kumbh started once there was a king called bagiratha who was a farmers leader those farmers faced a severe water crisis then which made him to take a pledge of bringing down the ganga who had been dwelling on the mountains along with his 60000 farmers he worked day in and day out to realize his dream finally ganga came down to the plains the farmers on both the side of her started practicing agriculture their homes became prosperous and their souls were liberated till the time of bagiratha there were no big issues on sharing her water among the farmers but the next generation did not kept quiet the farmers started fighting with each other the climax came to settle down these issues farmers met the rishis the then king was also present wise rishis said see ganga is not ours not even yours everybody has the right to use her waters but also we have the duty to conserve our ganga for her unobstructed flow for generations importantly the king has higher responsibility of implementing this understanding every one nodded and the tradition of kumbh started at that very moment for generations common people saints and even the kings gathered for kumbh to show their solidarity in conserving the purity of ganga but friends today kumbh is just a ritual it is polluting ganga like anything in this regard any river in this country is getting polluted severely is being encroached and exploited unmindfully it seems that the darkness is enfolding the country from every direction it seems that there is no way out for escaping from this darkness if this situation continues it is sure that we are going to face a severe water crisis in the near future will we survive out of this crisis will we rejuvenate the rivers will we understand the importance of harvesting the rain water where ever it is possible yes we know that it is a himalayan task to bring sustainable water prosperity in this country but it is not impossible more over it is very necessary if an isolated deserted village like khajura could spring up with full of life by using time tested traditional water conservation methods why couldn t other parts of our country if the villagers of khajura could rise from their painful past why couldn t all of us we are not going to say what was the condition prevailed here or how they have succeeded in rejuvenating their maheshwari river we only invite you to see by yourself hear the story from the villagers friends from struggle comes strength and the strength is retained through solidarity let us show our solidarity to keep our earth green rivers alive to pass on pure waters to our next generations come and conquer the evils which destroy the very life of our planet expecting your presence and participation with regards rajendra singh tarun bharat sangh note simple lodging and boarding facilities are arranged in the villages routes by bus 1 new delhi isbt nh8 dharuheda 70km to biwadi 3 km to alwar 40km to mandawar 55 km to mahowa 23 km to hindon 30 km to karoli 25 km to kailadevi 21 km to khajura village 17 km 284 km 2 jaipur karoli kailadevi khajura 3 agra nh11 mahowa karoli kailadevi khajura by train 1 from south india gangapur railway station after getting down here catch a bus to karoli 24 km then follow the karoli kailadevi khajura route 2 from north hindon railway station after getting down here catch a bus to karoli 25 km then follow the karoli kailadevi khajura route 34 46 kiran path mansarovar jaipur 302020 raj rajendra singh ramon magsaysay awardee chairperson phone 9414066765 email watermantbs yahoo com jalpurushtbs gmail com invitation for jal kumbh albiradari 34 46 kiran path mansarovar jaipur 302020 raj rajendra singh ramon magsaysay awardee chairperson phone 9414066765 worshipping the river ganga the tradition behind the kumbh mela can obama deliver what he promised only if the american people support his vision with passion and sacrifice flow

9181772 this measure will certainly increase the return but it is a process that will take time because people want to see first how it turns out
9181773 iraqi forces will be on alert from september 2 to evacuate the homes of the displaced families
9181774 i do not expect people to return in large numbers but it is certainly a positive step because one of the main concerns of these people is that others are occupying their homes
9181775 seventy percent of the occupied public buildings are held by militias
9181776 it is not just people who are occupying in some regions the militias took control of whole districts and leased it to refugees
9181777 there are terrorist groups who do not want the families to return and are preventing them from doing so the government and the army are closely tracking such cases

9181810 la mia squadra del cuore la fiorentina da sempre entrando il viola nel cuore con la comprensione del gioco del calcio e delle sue regole nei primi anni dellinfanzia
9181811 ritengo che anche questanno linter sia in pole position ma dietro vedo immediatamente roma fiorentina juventus mentre non ritengo che il milan abbia fatto la campagna acquisti di giusto rinnovamento in grado di risolvere i problemi maturati nello scorso anno
9181812 la fiorentina di cesare prandelli si notevolmente rafforzata e vedo una squadra finalmente dotata di una ricca rosa di giocatori in grado di affrontare campionato e champions al massimo livello sicuramente prandelli la figura fondamentale che riesce a motivare ottenere da ciascun calciatore quanto di meglio pu rendere trovare gli schemi con cui ottimizzare la rosa che ha a disposizione sul momento
9181813 ritengo e spero che il siena possa anche questanno ambire alla salvezza
9181814 linter ha cambiato allenatore ma ha mantenuto inalterato lottimo organico a sua disposizione quindi credo che partir ancora come la squadra da battere per vedo bene anche la juventus che reputo in grado di competere fino in fondo proprio con la squadra neroazzurra
9181815 credo che la fiorentina possa disputare una stagione di alto livello soprattutto grazie ad un allenatore che rappresenta un vero galantuomo per il mondo del calcio ed stimato da tutto lambiente ma anche in virt dellottimo organico allestito questanno e una squadra giovane ed in rampa di lancio che torner ad affacciarsi anche nelleuropa che conta di pi con le potenzialit per fare bella figura
9181816 dobbiamo vivere alla giornata partendo dallobiettivo minimo della salvezza sar un traguardo da costruire partita dopo partita con grande determinazione in campo e costante sostegno sugli spalti ci vorr molta attenzione perch si annuncia una lotta molto serrata con le altre squadre che giocheranno per non retrocedere siamo per fiduciosi di poter far bene e continuare a dire la nostra nel campionato pi affascinante del mondo
9181817 penso che sar un buon risultato ottenere le prestazioni del campionato passato gi la salvezza non sicura non valuto positivamente il complesso della campagna acquisti con la cessione di importanti giocatori

9181841 performance as absolute and measurable as it might seem also has a lot of subtlety there are many elements and many tradeoffs involved in achieving performance that meets everyones expectations we know that even meeting expectations folks will want even more out of their windows pcs and thats expected weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area in windows 7 and ie 8 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams fundamentals
9181842 how much memory a given scenario allocates during a run as you know there is a classic tradeoff in time v space in computer science and were not exempt we see this tradeoff quite a bit in caches where you can use more memory or disk space in order to improve performance or to avoid re computing something

9181928 knock out your opposition challenge their petitions destroy your enemy right it is how barack obama destroyed his enemies back in 1996 that conflicts with his message today he may have gotten his start registering thousands of voters but in that first race he made sure voters had just one choice
9181929 although we are awaiting some more confirmed dates we wanted to let you all know as soon as possible about the upcoming uk tour this will be a three band bill with the

9181932 i am quite disappointed that my time with manchester united has finished like this with so many injury problems
9181933 but i am very happy that a club of evertons stature have shown they are interested in me its a club that is involved in european football and i was very impressed when i spoke to their manager david moyes he told me exactly how he wanted me to play he was very honest with me i also spoke to sir alex ferguson and his opinion was that it would be good for me to sign for everton because i would get the chance to play more there
9181934 louis is a good centre forward who has a bit of everything
9181935 he can run head the ball and score goals and he hasnt cost us any money if i can get him out there 20 times a season that would give us a chance of winning 20 games he picked up a calf strain in training at united but it isnt far away from being ok now
9181936 if it was me and i was in the same situation i would be working for the club as hard as i could until told otherwise
9181937 if i didnt want to be somewhere id still give my all every training session every game some players will work in these situations and others wont its a dream for him to play for them the only thing is the way you go about doing the transfer
9181938 it doesnt give out a great message and hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country from the supporters point of view
9181939 the board have said that the deal is closed they tottenham had seven weeks to buy him but the truth is that they have never bid the 22m that we wanted they offered only 16m a player of arshavins quality is worth more than that

9181948 my advice is always the same avoid mosquito bites wear long pants long sleeves use insect repellant preferably one containing deet and if possible avoid activities from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes may be biting most heavily
9181949 its also a good idea to make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquitoes from getting inside your house

9181970 i would like the theme robinhos future to be wrapped up now but it isnt he will not travel to la coruna
9181971 it is my decision not the clubs for me he is an important player but it is also important to know what condition he will be in and the pressure from those advising him has been strong
9181972 mentally he isnt in the best state to play until his future is resolved he will not be ready to either at present it is better for other players who are fully committed to take his place
9181973 i would be delighted to do the dirty work of trying to raise his morale again i am confident we would be able to do that within the group with the support of the players and it would be just like it always was

9181981 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
9181982 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
9181983 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
9181984 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
9181985 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
9181986 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
9181987 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
9181988 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

9182046 oracle based in redwood city california sells a wide range of enterprise software solutions including databases middleware and applications
9182047 the company has an active acquisition program that is a fundamental component of its strategy orcl has spent more than 28 billion in acquisitions the last four fiscal years
9182048 the stocks long term chart shows a powerful run up to 40 during the 2000 bull market
9182049 the handle portion of the base has shown a nice contraction in volume showing that selling pressure is drying up that reflects itself in the accumulation distribution line which is still trending higher
9182050 the company will be reporting a big jump in quarterly earnings soon this fiscal year ending may 2009 analysts forecast a 17 increase in earnings to 1 48 a share from 1 26 a share a year ago the stock sells with a price earnings ratio of 14 which is low given the growth rate
9182051 what makes orcl look good at this point is that earnings for the upcoming fiscal first quarter ending august 30 should jump 30 to 26 cents a share from 20 cents a year ago the growth rate for the quarter is well above the norm and could attract attention and buyers for the stock
9182052 the highest estimate for the quarter is at 27 cents a share we see chances for a modest upside surprise the past three quarters orcl topped the consensus estimate by one to four cents a share

9182058 she is as about far from washington d c not only geographically but in regard to what goes on in d c the politics as usual
9182059 all these candidates talk about the middle income america and the working families she is from the working families
9182060 the obama camp did not even consider the most powerful political woman in the country as a presidential possibility and i think a lot of hillary clinton supporters now have a place to go
9182061 there was talk the other night about hillary clinton almost breaking the glass ceiling well it is the republicans who are actually breaking it

9182071 as for this past week the key numbers were 1306 1264 and 1292 looking at a chart makes it seem impossible to have them in advance but members can verify them
9182072 it is funny your comment about the es right now i have only tried to trade it three times the last 2 weeks got stopped out twice made a little the third time it was just too much chop trying to use the proshare ultra etfs that i took your recommendation and looked at other markets i traded oil and nat gas and have had the two most successful weeks profit wise and made the fewest trades since i joined thanks for focusing us on new markets
9182073 we showed a lot of character and played some really good cricket in the last two months
9182074 credit to the boys for coming back and finishing off with a win
9182075 the indians played very well and they deserved to win
9182076 we made mistakes and were not consistent especially with out batting if you want to win matches then your batting ought to come good
9182077 we played with a different combination today as we wanted to give some of the others an opportunity
9182078 in previous games we played six batsmen and five bowlers but its not about the combination
9182079 its a question of adapting to the conditions and thats what we did today
9182080 the ball always does a bit under lights and there is always a little assistance for the fast bowlers
9182081 im very happy with the way we have performed we lost the first match at dambulla because we were a little low at that point
9182082 but we worked on our basics and got it right we dearly wanted to series win in sri lanka because thats something we havent managed in the past
9182083 so its a tremendous feeling to have finally achieved that
9182084 i think someone else would have got the runs even i hadnt got them
9182085 i though suresh raina batted very well and there were contributions from gautam gambhir and virat kohli as well
9182086 everyone has contributed and shouldered responsibility and thats the significant part of this triumph

9182105 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9182106 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9182107 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9182108 someone yelled out hey senator but i was offended they didnt call me mr president
9182109 a lot of foreigners on the cruise kept pointing at me talking in different languages and saying obama
9182110 he was behind a tiki bar serving drinks and when he stood up my eyes just about popped out of my head i said there is no way that barack obama is here i laughed like crazy
9182111 it undercuts one of the points they are making that she is an ethical reformer
9182112 governor palin has been fully cooperative in this situation and has nothing to hide she has been a leader and proven reformer demanding accountability and transparency from alaskas government which resulted in landmark ethics legislation
9182113 shes going to add some zest to the ticket and is going to have some appeal to the disaffected hillary voters
9182114 of course alaska is far from florida and she probably faces a steep learning curve competing on the same stage as joe biden
9182115 she ran as a reformer at a time the republican party in the state was viewed as having a number of problems from a lack of new personalities to ethics problems as a result she rode a populist reformer message mixed with a very conservative ideology to office
9182116 if the whole point was to step on obamas day then theyve done that
9182117 i tried to get a license here and it cost too much money
9182118 ive been a fan of hers for quite a while
9182119 i dont think john mccain could have made a better choice
9182120 she is really strong on ethics she is serious about cutting government spending and waste and ive got to tell you i think she is going to do a fantastic job
9182121 every few minutes you heard roars of approval and applause and smiles
9182122 the republican party really has never gotten credit for having the respect and belief in the capability of womens leadership
9182123 shes a social conservative a gun owner and she brings a lot of experience we think thats a huge positive
9182124 it caught me off guard but im impressed and excited by what im hearing about her
9182125 i think you are talking about somebody who has the experience of running state government so hopefully she will make a good transition to the federal government
9182126 ive talked to a couple of people today and they told me it has already made a difference in the fact that they are going to vote for mccain now
9182127 i think you will find more conservative democrats and moderate to conservative independents considering mccain
9182128 ive heard good things about her especially wanting to drill for oil in her home state 1 000 miles from the closest tree
9182129 and shes going to bring youth to the ticket for sure she also must be politically savvy because she came from being a mayor in a small town ran for governor beat out her own partys person and beat the former governor in the election
9182130 i think unless somebody steps on a land mine that john mccain just won the election today
9182131 i have a staff member who is a democrat and a strong hillary clinton supporter who is now going to vote for mccain
9182132 there are going to be a lot of democrats who are hillary clinton supporters that are very angry right now because barack obama couldnt put a woman on his ticket but john mccain could
9182133 im here because 45 years ago when i was only 4 years old thousands of americans black and white descended on the nations capital to demand an end to racial segregation
9182134 now for the first time in americas history barack obama a black man is about to embody the dream of those marchers by becoming the first black nominee for the highest office in the land
9182135 im here because the excitement over obama is even showing in jacksonville
9182136 ive always liked michelle obama but up until she spoke monday i didnt realize that she and i were kindred spirits we both believe that we can do more to uplift our communities by moving back to them
9182137 when barack obama officially became the democratic nominee for the president of the united states a number of african american delegates had a hard time holding back the tears
9182138 one of the delegates talked about how he grew up under segregation in a time just 50 years ago when blacks couldnt eat in the same restaurants nor use the same public facilities
9182139 another remembered that just 44 years ago it took an act of congress and the will of a president to sign the voting rights act and the civil rights act to ensure that black people could go to the polls without being asked to recite the constitution or to say how many bubbles were in a bar of soap
9182140 there are 85 000 people you can influence at one time
9182141 of course were not going to reach everyone even if you get 5 percent thats substantial
9182142 we break down energy consumption elements each one has a carbon coefficient
9182143 we add up all those individual elements that becomes the footprint of the game
9182144 our commitment is to create these offsets within 100 miles
9182145 people should be able to see it we want to benefit the community
9182146 its kind of like the gators are one step ahead of fsu
9182147 we break down energy consumption elements each one has a carbon coefficient
9182148 john mccains running mate is for big oil and against the environment
9182149 if you are not for opening anwr in the state of alaska you couldnt get elected dogcatcher
9182150 i am pleased to see sen obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9182151 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9182152 energy production front and center in the policy debate once again
9182153 my pockets are empty and i dont know so is my heart i just feel drained
9182154 my own school board tells me tonight that they cannot give us a contract to show their appreciation in the classroom doing what i do best the board says there is no money for you dear the cost of living is becoming unbearable do i go to publix and say im a teacher in an a district so please honor me by giving me last years costs
9182155 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9182156 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9182157 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9182158 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9182159 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9182160 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9182161 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9182162 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9182163 to my knowledge and i was not here at the time none of what i see in here is accurate or true
9182164 theyre just trying to create as much damage as possible
9182165 the managing owner of the dealership is the appropriate person to address the issue
9182166 i just wanted to go and get my head together
9182167 and if you find that theres significant accounting discrepancies you dont typically go through a warning process
9182168 there have been children and adults both that have died from the use of prone restraints
9182169 and i dont understand why schools are even considering using this type of a restraint on a child with a disability when mental facilities and psychiatric facilities are trying to get away from this type of restraint
9182170 the minimal force necessary to prevent undue harm or injury to the student s or others or significant damage to property
9182171 not be used as an instrument for the educators anger or frustration with a situation or student
9182172 it sounds as though what we are doing is in a sense legitimizing the physical handling and potential abuse of our children
9182173 train up a child in the way that he she should go and when he she is old they will not depart from it
9182174 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9182175 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9182176 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9182177 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9182178 i think shes a mile wide and about an inch deep
9182179 but she has the alaskan touch shes a hockey mom she hunts she fishes her husband is a mans man her son joined the army these are powerful images that resonate with a lot of people
9182180 from the moment she began making her mark in politics she was criticized for being too young too inexperienced and too naive
9182181 yet time after time over the years underestimating sarah always proved to be a big mistake
9182182 speaking her own mind and then worrying about whether its popular afterward
9182183 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of u s vehicles traveling to the iss international space station as efficiently as possible
9182184 the e mail is premature the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9182185 its just so spectacular its just awesome seeing all the lights up in the sky and its great to be able to see it all with your friends
9182186 i think its fantastic theres nothing like this down south and youve got the water there for the kids to swim in and the fireworks are great
9182187 i absolutely love it its always a real big opener and its just fantastic to see
9182188 i will not die with any money i can promise you that
9182189 this years high interest rate environment put the brakes on but with signs that interest rates are trending down buyer activity is likely to gradually strengthen
9182190 weve been living with andrews sister because rental prices are so high and we wanted to save to get a bit of a deposit
9182191 this government has been caught out deliberately fudging the true number of public hospital beds by changing the definition of bed
9182192 number of available bed and available bed alternatives for public acute hospitals
9182193 queensland health data dictionary defines an available bed as a bed which is immediately available to be used by an admitted patient if required and an available bed alternative as an item of furniture for example trolley and cot non recognised beds occupied or not which is immediately available for use by admitted patients
9182194 number of items of furniture eg trolleys chairs cots non recognised beds etc
9182195 i dont think the thousands of people coming into our major hospitals every day for renal dialysis or chemotherapy would agree with that
9182196 it has been pretty bad but theres been a big improvement since the notices went up
9182197 the program has been a success i can say we have far less problems with the children theyre more aware of what they can and cant do
9182198 the students have an id card and when they swipe that card they are given a piece of paper with their id their photograph and the time they left school
9182199 there are six other schools on the gold coast doing this and it will spread through queensland
9182200 im sure they will react because whenever they see a bad person on tv they will say mommy that person is bad and they might tell me mommy youre bad
9182201 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9182202 we must also admit that government programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9182203 when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir this note was a promise that all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
9182204 is very emotional to people who had such a negative reception in the community for so many years myself my friends and my family
9182205 we felt we were batting our heads against the wall but we felt we have to keep trying and here we are
9182206 many of our white brothers have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk alone
9182207 i could not in 1934 attend public schools could not go to public pools and beaches so i felt some of the discrimination minorities in the united states did
9182208 there were people against me doing that for black people
9182209 i was in agreement with that belief that all men are created equal
9182210 i saw history being made and the wishes of martin luther king becoming reality even if there still are a lot of things to be done
9182211 im still not sure what happens when people get into the voting booth but hopefully prejudices have been overcome i hope he wins by a goodly margin
9182212 m nsch wir haben doch schon im sandkasten burgen gebaut
9182213 americans like risk takers but they also want to know that in times of crisis youre going to be calm
9182214 americans dont necessarily want somebody in a time of crisis to be overly emotional
9182215 thats the balance that john mccains going to have to show the public
9182216 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
9182217 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
9182218 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
9182219 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
9182220 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
9182221 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
9182222 listen to the guy thats been on the mountaintop and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
9182223 to climb his way out of the real problem he has with women
9182224 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
9182225 i dont think you can come into a state like ohio and have any success at all with a complete free trade policy and lack of concern about the downside of globalization
9182226 this is an issue that would play very very well with a demographic he needs to pick up
9182227 there are a lot of voters particularly white working class voters who are against nafta
9182228 democrats have to tread lightly because bill clinton was in the white house when nafta passed
9182229 the nafta stuff will in fact come back into the campaign dramatically
9182230 its a contrast that makes a great deal of difference in key states such as ohio pennsylvania and michigan
9182231 the democrats campaign as perfectionists take advantage of the fact that trade is treated with suspicion and harvest votes as critics of trade but being under no obligation to deliver on what they promise
9182232 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9182233 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
9182234 im aware of enhanced importance of this issue because of my age
9182235 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
9182236 governor palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
9182237 theres just those people who you meet in life and in politics where immediately you are just drawn to them and want to be around them and you can feel that genuineness from her
9182238 she can relate to our struggles and our own lives
9182239 but having said that one thing i do know is that people made the mistake of underestimating her at least underestimating that ability to connect with people
9182240 there were no public policy initiatives no grasp of public policy but people loved her
9182241 but that took it out of the realm of the poseur and established a great deal of trust with voters
9182242 after the election there was a sort of veil that dropped and there was really been no way to be able to communicate
9182243 when people say it that way it sounds like a good thing
9182244 but frankly in terms of running the government its a handicap she doesnt want to do politics as usual but she doesnt have another method other than beating the crap out of the legislature
9182245 we are in the midst of quite a period of revelation and we dont know where this will all lead
9182246 you know governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9182247 i think dr king would have been proud to have witnessed tonights events
9182248 no place in my mind or im sure his would we have imagined seeing so many people of all type of backgrounds rallying behind someone like us who had been denied full participation for so long
9182249 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
9182250 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
9182251 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging
9182252 if we were being true to kings dream wed be talking about poverty how to eradicate it and the long list of things that mattered to him
9182253 i just fear that his legacy will get glossed over
9182254 for most americans august 28 1963 was the dream speech day and for them its like a happy day
9182255 that is a one dimensional view of the risk and terror of that day
9182256 he greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation
9182257 has given the negro people a bad check a check that has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation
9182258 i feel that he truly does offer hope for this nation for all americans not some americans all americans
9182259 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9182260 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
9182261 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9182262 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9182263 i agree as a general rule that the state chair should not get involved in primaries except in the rarest of circumstances
9182264 he has not proven to be the uniter that he ran as
9182265 there were a couple of races where i wished id put in a little more resources but at the end of the day i was really pleased
9182266 well know what kind of job he did come election day
9182267 i would be shocked if he would not be in the cabinet in a mccain presidency
9182268 hes clearly a guy who has got all the executive tools to solve some of the problems our country faces i very much expect that
9182269 governor romney will continue to be a pretty powerful force in the republican party nationally obviously if john mccain is elected i suspect hed be considered for the cabinet
9182270 of course id be a liar if i said otherwise
9182271 im a huge fan of mitt romney and i think hes a tremendously talented person and would bring lots to the table in ways that are different than the governor of alaska
9182272 two different r sum s if you will its no disrespect to mitt in any way
9182273 governor palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger i look forward to campaigning for senator mccain governor palin and republicans all across the country
9182274 doing a better job for me than he did for himself
9182275 they developed a very solid relationship which i think is one of the biggest prides of the last two months
9182276 this is a maverick picking a maverick and i think it makes sense
9182277 id be shocked if he did not throw himself fully into this fall campaign and be a huge asset
9182278 im sure hes going to do everything he can to help the mccain palin ticket over the next 67 days
9182279 i wanted to see if the campaign was quick enough to snatch up the domain names
9182280 official home of the hundred year war and bushs third term
9182281 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same
9182282 were going to beat the hell out of em in november
9182283 people who understand him know hell say whatever he wants to say
9182284 he will never give a speech on just one topic ever
9182285 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
9182286 hillary moving for acclamation just put the good housekeeping stamp of approval on the whole thing
9182287 it totally worked i told you it would create more unity than trying to force unity by ignoring the divisions
9182288 i never had any doubt that hillary would do what she did she is a true star putting the country ahead of herself
9182289 who can best help me shake up washington and make it work again for the people who are counting on us
9182290 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee
9182291 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9182292 does not have the experience to step in and serve as our commander and chief
9182293 an encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in politics
9182294 shes not from washington and shes not from these parts but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9182295 the women of america arent finished and it turns out we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9182296 would have helped us more than any other candidate in michigan
9182297 i think anybody that is really invested in michigan thought it would have been a much easier road certainly to have a favorite son on the ticket
9182298 that said i think sarah palin has a whole lot of appeal that certainly can translate to michigan
9182299 knows what its like to get home after a hard day of work and find out the works not done
9182300 sharp contrast with senator obama who ignored nearly half of his party who strongly supported senator clinton
9182301 when senator obama had an opportunity to make history by asking a clearly qualified and widely supported woman to serve on this ticket he chose one of the good old boys
9182302 every woman who has fought their way up through hard work in either business or politics can understand what that is all about
9182303 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9182304 you know our families have just really hit it off
9182305 we had some of his grandkids over for a sleepover with malia and sasha and they they just had a great time im absolutely convinced that joe biden is the right person to help move this country in the direction where working families have a shot
9182306 im hoping to hear a lot about alternative energy sources because a lot of those jobs could come to michigan
9182307 the issues of importance to michigan will be front and center
9182308 manufacturing industry what needs to be done those will all be talked about
9182309 weve got our clothes laid out to pack for the convention but its tough to go from cruise to business casual
9182310 i didnt want to miss it i love the speeches the excitement the enthusiasm of everybody on the floor you just cant be blas at one of these things
9182311 politics in some ways got us together so its fitting well be at a convention celebrating 50 years together we started talking about politics way back then and were still talking about it
9182312 in four short years i am knee deep in politics
9182313 instead of being like most 20 somethings and complaining i am involved in the process and speaking my mind
9182314 im surprised to learn im the oldest delegate because i sure wasnt when i started
9182315 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9182316 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9182317 i think shes a mile wide and about an inch deep
9182318 but she has the alaskan touch shes a hockey mom she hunts she fishes her husband is a mans man her son joined the army these are powerful images that resonate with a lot of people
9182319 from the moment she began making her mark in politics she was criticized for being too young too inexperienced and too naive
9182320 yet time after time over the years underestimating sarah always proved to be a big mistake
9182321 speaking her own mind and then worrying about whether its popular afterward
9182322 i love my dog but it doesnt mean i should be able to marry it
9182323 she doesnt pass the test for being a heartbeat away from the presidency
9182324 shes allowed her personal life to affect her decision making ability
9182325 senator john mccain has made a great pick in governor sarah palin
9182326 she has demonstrated tremendous leadership as the chief executive of her state working to bring republicans and democrats together to do whats right
9182327 there is no doubt that the democrats continue to be frustrated because of barack obamas failure to pick hillary clinton as a running mate
9182328 i think certainly that women in florida will be very supportive
9182329 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9182330 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9182331 a woman of faith who has a strong position on life a consistent opinion on judges shes the complete package
9182332 the question is how this will be received by a lot of rank and file evangelicals who are just americans struggling along going to their megachurches and care about values
9182333 mccain is saying to social and religious conservatives im taking your views incredibly seriously
9182334 its one of those inevitable draws and some rehearsal for 30 november
9182335 itll make many mouths water and i dont think there will be many spare tickets
9182336 even leaving aside the third round of the cup itll be about bragging rights but weve just got to get on with it and win
9182337 ive heard a lot about swansea v cardiff and been involved in a few emotional derbies myself like leeds v manchester united
9182338 our job will be to focus on the football and take the emotion out of it
9182339 but the first thing is to speak to swansea and to the police to set the exact date sort out cardiffs ticket allocation and most importantly to ensure a safe environment for everyone
9182340 football has moved on and both of these clubs have moved on from some of the things that have gone on in the past
9182341 were at the liberty stadium and cardiff are looking forward to moving to their new ground there are a lot more women and children coming to games
9182342 we can be positive its a fantastic draw and we look forward to a great night for welsh football
9182343 it bought the triviality artful dodge who are my humble self in transit to deliver self what heart water closet ocherish bathroomt bilk really into
9182344 i am very proud of all the people who have supported me and i feel even more hate for this tyranny
9182345 want to teach me a lesson every chance they get
9182346 there were a lot of repercussions and they were very afraid
9182347 you know its been a tough night when the third base coach limps off pollreisz said
9182348 i liked the outcome though but i also knew at that point that it felt a lot better sitting down than it did standing up
9182349 i would have liked to have seen some better at bats later in the game
9182350 theyve been going full blast for awhile i wanted to give them a rest there was no better time to do it than all in one day
9182351 miller pitched two good quality innings and then in the third he threw a lot of balls
9182352 thompson gave us five quality innings but threw one bad pitch a home run by felix carrasco he should have pitched around him
9182353 la agresi n iniciada por el presidente georgiano mija l saakashvili contra el pueblo suroesta cambi radicalmente las condiciones bajo las cuales durante los ltimos 17 a os se emprendieron todos los esfuerzos posibles para estabilizar las relaciones de osetia del sur y abjasia con georgia
9182354 la clara expresi n de la voluntad del pueblo suroesta y abjaso que sigui a los acontecimientos especialmente contra los intentos de remilitarizaci n del r gimen de saakashvili y sus declaraciones de venganza como tel n de fondo requer a una respuesta inmediata para garantizar su seguridad y supervivencia
9182355 subray que rusia cumple en su totalidad los seis principios del plan medv dev sarkozy y se al que contin an siendo totalmente v lidos
9182356 rusia no s lo apoya sino que llama a un mayor despliegue adicional de observadores de la organizaci n para la seguridad y cooperaci n en europa osce en la zona de seguridad
9182357 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9182358 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9182359 the labours and the rest of them havent done the canvassing in the same way the bnp have so an average person is going to vote for the person whos come and knocked on their door and taken time to speak to them
9182360 from personal experience ive had three leaflets from the bnp posted through my door and none from the other parties
9182361 a lot of the time it makes you think about entering certain areas especially if you are a taxi driver as some of us are
9182362 its not fashionable to champion the cause of the white working class in fact i think were seen as something of a nuisance
9182363 we are going to continue with high visibility patrols tonight and as long as we perceive it to be necessary
9182364 there is a very bad situation now not only for qataris but for all arabs
9182365 though one cannot deny that some farmers committed suicide last year the figures were not as large as quoted in the programme in a probe ordered by punjab government 12 farmers were found to have committed suicide for the same reason radio pakistan exaggerates figures to create sensation over such issues it seems that the pakistan media has some vested interest in painting a negative picture of the state of punjab
9182366 people of punjab have moved ahead of the blue star operation and gradually things have moved to normalcy all around we the residents of punjab know better about the state than anyone else the situation here is not at all bad
9182367 that party to solve the problem as they have created it
9182368 they have created the problem and they have to find a solution to it as such
9182369 while the protestors in jammu are agitating with indian flag the separatist forces in kashmir are protesting with pakistans flag
9182370 bjp does not consider all living in kashmir as separatist we consider the majority of population living there as nationalist who get along with handful of separatists due to fear
9182371 all of you have been influential in the lives of the people here on guam
9182372 is this just something she says or does it indicate something she believes
9182373 she drives the bus because she loves kids and she loves to work
9182374 then what happened was that she went ahead and said that she would turn off the air conditioner you know trying to get them to be quiet
9182375 especially with all the stories you hear about children dying in hot cars theres no reason anyone should be disciplined that way
9182376 es k nnte sein dass mit zu wenig gegessen oder getrunken hat
9182377 er lag v llig leblos am boden der puls kam nur ganz kurz dann war er wieder weg
9182378 sein gesicht seine augen haben mich das schlimmste bef rchten lassen
9182379 hier geht es auch um menschen hier geht es nicht nur um punkte und siege

9182382 gatsby believed in the green light the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us it eluded us then but thats no matter tomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms farther and then one fine morning so we beat on boats against the current drawn back ceaselessly into the past

9182386 when we journalists talk about integration we generally mean integrating print and online activities but the true integration comes online itself the integration between journalists and citizens

9182389 hey i didnt know you have a twin so you guys should look alike lahh
9182390 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9182391 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet
9182392 at this time we do not plan to pursue hipaa certification for our consumer evernote service
9182393 im not able to do the number of laps i like doing
9182394 everything was going quite well in the morning but i struggled a little bit in the afternoon session
9182395 the bike i had the quickest time on this morning didnt work in the afternoon
9182396 this weather is a lot better for going to the beach than to the race track
9182397 but its better like this than at other races where we always have a lot of rain
9182398 i did a good job in qualifying second position is good for tomorrow i had a problem in the second sector in some corners i wasnt fast enough
9182399 but i have done some good work on the set up and hope tomorrow i hope ill be faster
9182400 to beat stoner tomorrow will be difficult my aim is to finish in the top five
9182401 i have to prepare myself for the worst and as long as i can do that its fine to hope for the best
9182402 i asked her if she was telling me it was terminal
9182403 she said yes so i asked how long i had the answer was six to 12 months
9182404 i have to prepare myself for the worst and as long as i can do that its fine to hope for the best
9182405 i also figure i can hope for spontaneous regression but this is so rare and unlikely that i havent even discussed it with my oncologist
9182406 a mate sent me a message that said as random and nonsensical as these situations are surely the same must apply to their departure i like that why couldnt that be me
9182407 i just thought i was in an unusual position to let people get an insight into the mind of someone in a situation thats so i dont know so nasty and so far removed from what any other 28 year old in a western country is going through
9182408 and to get a few things straight in my head i wrote for a month before i shared the link with anyone
9182409 sometimes i feel like a failure it shouldnt be that hard to live for 60 80 years loads of people do it all the time without even trying keith richards has done it despite actively trying to kill himself for 40 years
9182410 theyve got another 50 or 60 years ahead of them people will ask if theyve got brothers or sisters how will they respond do they say theyve got one sister or do they say theyve got a sister and a brother i dont know
9182411 in a weird way thinking about the funeral cheers me up itll be huge theyll be scalping tickets im hoping
9182412 no one can tell you what thats going to be like its a very very private lonely journey and i can only pray and hope that its pain free and not too uncomfortable
9182413 melanoma and cancer are very real they dont always affect the very old or the very young and theyre not always self inflicted toomey was never a sun seeker and when they get away from you they can be very very nasty
9182414 but for all that they can still be treatable if theyre caught early so for gods sake if you notice something get it looked at
9182415 i think the human mind is pretty good at adjusting its priorities to its circumstances
9182416 people often ask me how ive been able to stay so collected and together but i honestly think that most people would find themselves in the same mindset once theyd gotten over the initial shock
9182417 i cried myself to sleep for probably a week but at some point after that i just decided that i had to start thinking more constructively about my situation
9182418 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9182419 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9182420 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9182421 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9182422 understanding what our busy on the go customers want and constantly innovating to meet those needs is the single biggest reason for our brands growth and success both our customers and franchisees have told us theyre looking for a greater breadth of menu choices that include better for you options without compromising quality taste and value with ddsmart we have enhanced our menu to ensure our restaurants offer great tasting food and beverages that fit any customers lifestyle
9182423 at one point we were talking about instead of me getting killed at the end of the movie what if i didnt
9182424 ich sp rte dass mit dem flugzeug etwas nicht stimmt ich klammerte mich an meinen sitz mehr wei ich nicht als ich den kopf hob hatte das flugzeug kein dach mehr
9182425 wer im notfall ein paar regeln kennt erh ht die berlebenschancen
9182426 ich sa direkt ber den fl geln nahe beim notausgang
9182427 dieser teil des flugzeugs ist durch das viele metall besonders stabil
9182428 es kommt also immer auch auf die art und den ablauf des ungl cks an
9182429 die maschine raste direkt auf den berg zu die nase des flugzeugs stie pl tzlich in die h he und mein magen f hlte sich an als w rde er in einer achterbahn sitzen ich schloss die augen und steckte meinen kopf zwischen die knie auf meinen scho
9182430 in echten notsituationen entscheiden sich viele gegen die durchsagen der crew und versuchen den ausgang zu erreichen der ihnen am n chsten liegt
9182431 ungl cklicherweise wei man aber nicht ob dieser auch intakt und benutzbar ist
9182432 ich schrie nur noch raus raus raus es waren zwei bis drei reihen bis zum notausgang dort haben sich die menschen schon gedr ngt
9182433 es war alles voller rauch und hei ohne ende f nf reihen vor mir konnte ich nichts mehr sehen
9182434 so findet man die rettende t re auch bei dichtem rauch
9182435 i personally collect anime figurines because it is a work of art
9182436 it isnt easy to sculpt a human body and make it look real and i only collect figurines which are able to capture the body movement and feeling of a certain character
9182437 i see figuring collecting as a hobby like how people collecting stamps and coins
9182438 and just like how rare stamps and coins can fetch high prices in the market the same goes for figurines most anime figurines have a limited release and if the demand is overwhelming the value of the figurine may increase several fold
9182439 the amount of detail and hard work put into sculpting anime figurines is also another thing that attracts me i even use them as models for photography
9182440 while i do not deny that figurines for adults do exist these figurines only make up a very small niche of the total figurine market
9182441 it is actually easier to find a normal decent figurine than an adult one unless you really go for it
9182442 adult figurines also clearly marked with an 18 and above rating which is printed on the box for easy reference and even then these figurines are always sold clothed and never nude just that there is the option to cast them off
9182443 i see anime figurines as 3d representatives of my favourite characters looking at them evokes fond memories of certain anime series
9182444 while it is true that some anime figurine can cost around rm300 this is due to the highly detailed sculpting and the effort that the sculptor has put into creating it
9182445 also a market survey of japanese figurine catalog shows that only a very small percentage of figurines are adult oriented figurines made by good reputable companies like good smile and alter are 100 clean and fit for all ages
9182446 it takes 90 years to grow a box of kleenex

9182452 here we have sarah as a pro life catholic and biden as a pro abortion catholic the catholic issue there is going to be very very strongly in play

9182658 we wanted to specialize strictly in a service not generally offered by other cpa firms something that business owners really need we determined that selling businesses is a perfect fit for our cpa experience and background
9182659 most business owners have never before sold a business and they know very little about selling their businesses for the most money a majority of business brokers and intermediaries just dont understand the accounting tax and financial concepts involved in maximizing a businesses value
9182660 during my years as a practicing cpa i helped negotiate and structure hundreds of business deals and i was always amazed at how little some business brokers and intermediaries knew about business financial matters
9182661 my goal is to educate business owners so they can prepare their businesses to bring the highest price when the time comes for them to sell

9182743 the handle portion of the base has shown a nice contraction in volume showing that selling pressure is drying up that reflects itself in the accumulation distribution line which is still trending higher
9182744 the company will be reporting a big jump in quarterly earnings soon this fiscal year ending may 2009 analysts forecast a 17 increase in earnings to 1 48 a share from 1 26 a share a year ago the stock sells with a price earnings ratio of 14 which is low given the growth rate
9182745 what makes orcl look good at this point is that earnings for the upcoming fiscal first quarter ending august 30 should jump 30 to 26 cents a share from 20 cents a year ago the growth rate for the quarter is well above the norm and could attract attention and buyers for the stock
9182746 the highest estimate for the quarter is at 27 cents a share we see chances for a modest upside surprise the past three quarters orcl topped the consensus estimate by one to four cents a share
9182747 the stocks institutional sponsorship is excellent the 5 star rated american funds fundamental investors was a recent buyer of 1 7 million shares also 5 star rated janus twenty fund added 19 million shares
9182748 boeing believes that its offer which is actually quite good would appeal to the workers if only presented to them directly the company seems to have confused public relations with collective bargaining
9182749 machinists have followed leaders voting recommendations in three of the last four negotiations stopping work over two of them to gain contract improvements the most recent walkout shaved 300 million from boeings second half earnings in 2005
9182750 boeing dropped most plans the union had termed strike issues and offered a package that would boost overall average compensation including overtime bonuses and benefits by 23 percent over three years to 110 400

9182757 you have a brand new electronic tolling system in place
9182758 youre going to have a major commute start on monday so that will be a full test of the system
9182759 the removal of the barrier should have been cause for celebration
9182760 instead we have higher tolls an administrative mess and pending chaos

9182781 enjoying her little piece of heaven in the mountains of colorado the stamp is actually from an old su set colored with prismacolor markers still trying to figure those things out i added a little stickles to the birds wings
9182782 we reviewed the evidence and determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge him with anything
9182783 i dressed up as a brave and they said i was offensive because i was too revealing on the sides of my body
9182784 bommersbach told me that it was way worse than a speedo and told me to put on my shorts and march to the office
9182785 i was in the assembly for probably about five minutes maybe less
9182786 it jeopardizes my ability to play in the next game
9182787 i thought it was a little revealing in the back so i was concerned
9182788 but he said others had worn speedos and that with the cloth his outfit was less revealing than that
9182789 speedos are something we have as a school uniform the team came to speak to me before the assembly i was a little reluctant but it was allowed as a team but a loincloth we dont have anywhere in our dress code
9182790 if someone asked if they could wear a loincloth id ask whats underneath
9182791 i had no idea it never crossed my mind that i would get in trouble
9182792 by then its already over and hes missed three practices
9182793 he was nervous and he told me he wanted to talk to me
9182794 getting off at a train station where youve never been
9182795 im at the depot and im going to see what its like
9182796 as food becomes a cause meeting puts issues on the table
9182797 its always good to be aware about the time of year when mosquitos are most active
9182798 we would like to t would take someone having a flock of chickens near a water source and then testing their blood to see if any of them come down with the virus however this process has to be voter approved
9182799 its a two series shot and then another shot annually to ensure horses dont come down with the virus people on the other hand are more susceptible because we have no vaccinations
9182800 it felt good to come out there and be able to just put the ball in play
9182801 we either need to do it through free agency or in house snider has been swinging the bat really well were going to get him up here and let him play and see what the evaluation is going into spring training
9182802 if we feel comfortable that hes a guy whos on the map then maybe we dont delve into the free agent market for a dh hes done so well in triple a that we want to just see him up here hes probably come faster than all of us expected sometimes kids force your hand
9182803 when hes on he scores goals and the team does well
9182804 we got embarrassed a little bit and i think our guys responded to that very well
9182805 i thought we gave the ball away cheaply too often
9182806 while we had fleeting opportunities we didnt make the most of them
9182807 im so excited because ive been really discouraged about the way our nation has been governed and about things that have happened in every area the federal government has been involved in
9182808 its really painful not to be able to choose her for a presidential candidate
9182809 but renewable energy thats what needs to be front and center of how we talk about energy
9182810 ive never had the privilege of representing my district in a government where theres compatibility within the two branches of government that have to do with policy and making change
9182811 ill be going to college campuses and working with the young people
9182812 the implication is that the format if adopted would dictate how the redistricting will occur to in the congressional races down the road
9182813 we always said we wanted to be the best team in the world
9182814 our goal now is to make sure the guys dont talk about their talent but they deliver their talent
9182815 i just want the guys to do as much as they can and to deliver deliver deliver
9182816 there is a lot of mediocrity that people settle for in this country in terms of county cricket i am not one for settling for mediocrity
9182817 i want to get better and better and better every single time i practise then you can entertain when you go out because you know you have done the hard yards before
9182818 as a kid i always wanted to be the best to win everything at school i dont like coming second so i will do anything to win if its fair and its legal
9182819 the effect it has had on the team right now is amazing a score of 3 0 is an absolute thrashing
9182820 the way we have done it is so convincing we havent looked like losing thats the best thing about it
9182821 whether it is 3 2 4 1 or 5 0 the guys in that dressing room know we have cleaned south africa up which is remarkable
9182822 a series win is a series win and the guys will take a lot of encouragement from this to wherever we go from here
9182823 the bowling unit is 100 per cent the strongest ive played with for england
9182824 the batting department if we had marcus trescothick at the top of the order that could strengthen our side but as far as i see it to beat south africa 3 0 the second ranked side in the world its a pretty special team weve got going
9182825 i let it affect me as a person i ran around the field and i was really unsure about certain things and how to handle it
9182826 because i thought ive got 24 hours in the job i have got to deliver here i put so much pressure on myself

9182830 it was kind of ironic at this stage of my life that i worked in a country that has more than 400 beers
9182831 but i found my bed more tempting they were long days
9182832 and i did alexander 2004 so i know what horse p tastes like
9182833 when i first read the script it was laugh out loud stuff and its not often you laugh out loud on your own reading something
9182834 but during the rehearsals we got inured to the comedy and regardless of how comedic the piece seems on the surface and how funny some of the interactions are theres an enormous amount of tragedy and pain and absolute despondency underneath nearly every single line
9182835 i was 22 or 23 years young and didnt know why or what or who or how or when i enjoyed it but then i stopped enjoying it i just got sick of myself
9182836 the journey got a little bit out of hand for me personally so i just stepped back ive definitely quietened down but ive done it selfishly because it suits me i just want a little bit of peace
9182837 i try to make sure they dont keep me up at night and they dont come between me and living in the present whatever that present may be
9182838 but yes there are a couple of things ive been part of that i regret a little bit if youre part of something and somebody gets hurt you always regret it
9182839 some of the best things that happen to you in life are unplanned and thats what my son is best thing thats ever happened to me

9182887 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years
9182888 i think i should be very careful with what i say lest folks get the idear were lesbos or something

9182892 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
9182893 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
9182894 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
9182895 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
9182896 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
9182897 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house

9182912 i believe and respect the dot as it symbolises the marital status of a hindu woman
9182913 just as we respect the right of married women to wear their wedding rings we also believe that similar treatment and respect must be accorded to hindu women wearing their powdered dots stick on or liquid
9182914 what is concerning that we are tolerant and accommodative of women who apply cosmetic powder on the whole face but intolerant when other women exercise their customary and religious rights by placing a powdered dot on their forehead
9182915 yellow peril science fiction was never large enough to be a genre in and of itself but i decided it was worth traveling back in time to revisit the trend in its historical context

9182921 die anonymous gruppe ist ein loser verband von internet terroristen die seit beginn diesen jahres aufm rsche in den usa und anderen l ndern abgehalten haben bei denen hass und propaganda gegen die scientology kirche und ihre mitglieder gesch rt wurden dabei wurde mehrfach zur vernichtung der scientology religion aufgerufen
9182922 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
9182923 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
9182924 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
9182925 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
9182926 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
9182927 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
9182928 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
9182929 preventing blood clot formation is one of the main goals when treating patients with arrhythmia which can result in a stroke and damage to the brain
9182930 while warfarin is a very effective therapy for the prevention of blood clot formation we are hopeful this clinical research will result in another treatment option for patients with atrial fibrillation
9182931 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
9182932 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
9182933 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
9182934 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
9182935 this is an exciting new method that will help us understand the timescales of fundamental volcanic processes driving eruptions
9182936 if you have high blood pressure eight dollars a pack checking your numbers regularly and making sure they are in control can save your life
9182937 taking your medicine as prescribed exercising and cutting your salt intake will all help bring your blood pressure down if you smoke quitting will help you avoid a heart attack
9182938 it shows who is getting infected now and where we need to direct resources for prevention testing linkage to care and partner notification
9182939 we have been successful in creating a very powerful and robust preclinical model of stroke to help us get a clearer picture of what causes this condition thus improving the efficacy of our treatment
9182940 the new model has the ability to screen drugs for their effectiveness in treating stroke patients and bridges the translational gap between laboratory and clinical research
9182941 minimizing injury to the brain in a stroke affected patient is the key improved preclinical models help us understand the biology of strokes and guide us in developing effective therapeutics
9182942 we developed a highly sophisticated experimental system including a novel surgical approach and state of the art post image processing that lends itself to identifying the cause of stroke as well as investigating the effectiveness of pharmacological therapies
9182943 we are hopeful that this new approach to study stroke biology and intervention in a preclinical model will prove to be an effective tool to address stroke as a major cardiovascular disease in humans
9182944 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
9182945 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
9182946 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
9182947 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
9182948 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
9182949 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
9182950 for 26 years ive been teaching ali about the religion

9182964 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9182965 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9182966 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9182967 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9182968 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9182969 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work

9183008 due to the absence of clearly defined legal rights the ineffectiveness of local courts and administrative procedures
9183009 imagine a place so clean where if you get sick all is taken care of for free there is no place like kuwait if youre a kuwaiti not only do you not pay any taxes you can borrow money to set up a business no taxes where in the world will you find a place where they give you money to set up a business and you dont have to pay taxes if you give birth to a child you also get money just to show you the strength of the dinar 10 dinars is enough to fill your grocery bags youd have a hard time lugging them home my purpose there when i left our country was to marry a kuwaiti because once youre married to one one was certain to live in great comfort but one disadvantage was their men want their wives to stay home

9183015 hazardous working conditions including contract substitution wage discrimination ill treatment by employers
9183016 i received a very low wage which i accepted because there was no alternative my employer did not follow the contract there was no day off i was maltreated overworked and had few hours sleep when i arrived in london my employer was always shouting at me for whatever little mistakes i did in the housework whenever i said that i was not feeling well my employer would shout back at me why are you not feeling well i did not pay for you in the agency to be sick i paid for you to work i wasnt feeling well because the food that i was eating was not enough to sustain me to do all of my work in the morning i would eat a slice of bread and have a cup of tea during lunch i would usually have a bowl of rice and some water and in the evening i would have a slice of bread and a cup of tea again the lady wants me to sleep in the garage if there is a carpet but i argue with her that the garage is only for the car and its very cold i told her that i cannot bear to sleep there
9183017 i have always worked in a hotel since coming here in 1975 first as a chambermaid then as a cashier my weekly wage is 81 pounds for a 40 hour week i always split duty 7 00 am to 11 am and 12 30 to 4 30 pm or 12 noon to 3 30 and 7 30 pm to midnight it doesnt matter even if i work weekends or bank holidays i never get any extra money only time off when were not too busy and now that business is not so good i never get an opportunity to do overtime
9183018 when they want me to do overtime even on my day off i might be asleep they just phone through and ask me to work even if i am off sick the supervisor comes to my room to check she doesnt believe i am telling the truth women feel unable to invite friends and feel perpetually under observation everybody knows everything about you they know if we go out or if we bring someone in and i feel people are always gossiping about me sometimes i feel so lonely and isolated even though there are plenty of people here my room is so small and stuffy but the bathroom is always so dirty the toilet is always out of order but i cannot move out because i couldnt afford to pay travelling expenses if i move too far from my work
9183019 i am pursued day and night thinking of my family at home even while i work my thoughts wander far and i spend my nights worrying or crying out of sheer helplessness my husband seems to be cooling off he seldom writes to me now i sometimes get dizzy and often have stomach pains my doctor says sorry but you must learn to live with it he gives me pills but they dont help
9183020 look at me now im old already and i still have to send 100 pounds a month home to educate my nieces and nephews how could i get married i got the opportunity to come to britain and it is my duty to help my family

9183042 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems that these players refuse to understand the problems being faced by us
9183043 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
9183044 graeme smiths response would be different if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
9183045 though one cannot deny that some farmers committed suicide last year the figures were not as large as quoted in the programme in a probe ordered by punjab government 12 farmers were found to have committed suicide for the same reason radio pakistan exaggerates figures to create sensation over such issues it seems that the pakistan media has some vested interest in painting a negative picture of the state of punjab
9183046 people of punjab have moved ahead of the blue star operation and gradually things have moved to normalcy all around we the residents of punjab know better about the state than anyone else the situation here is not at all bad
9183047 pakistan always intends to disturb peace in punjab its their habit to provoke and sensationalise issues that dont even exist at times they cook up stories and create unnecessary hype its common for radio pakistan and pakistan television to do anti india propaganda it clearly seems yet another gimmick of their international politics
9183048 the technology originates from a fundamental change in magnetic architecture and is composed of an integration of unique generator capability and energy battery management electronics
9183049 did not consider it necessary to form any view about the overall fairness of the military commissions procedure
9183050 the uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
9183051 it is hm governments position that evidence held by the uk government that us and moroccan authorities engaged in torture or rendition cannot be obtained
9183052 a serious potential threat to the security of the united kingdom
9183053 every reason to seek to obtain as much intelligence from him as was possible in accordance with the rule of law and to cooperate as fully as possible with the united states authorities to that end
9183054 would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the us authorities
9183055 was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
9183056 provided further information to the united states and further questions to be asked of bm binyam
9183057 was still incommunicado and they must also have appreciated that he was not in a united states facility and that the facility in which he was being detained was that of a foreign government other than afghanistan
9183058 sought to be used as a confession in a trial where the charges are very serious and may carry the death penalty
9183059 a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial
9183060 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities went far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
9183061 after the commencement of this application but before the hearing
9183062 identified documents which he considers could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of the proceedings before the military commission
9183063 it is a matter of regret that the documents have not been made available in the proceedings under the military commissions act in confidence to bms lawyers who have security clearance from the united states authorities to at least secret level
9183064 he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states
9183065 subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
9183066 had an opportunity to consider the interests of national security in the light of these judgments
9183067 likely to result in serious damage to us national security and could harm existing intelligence information sharing arrangements between our two governments
9183068 subject only to the condition that the names of american and british government officials and the locations of intelligence facilities will be redacted from the documents prior to their being provided
9183069 ordering the disclosure of us intelligence information now would have only the marginal effects of serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the united kingdom and of aggressive and unprecedented intervention in the apparently functioning adjudicatory processes of a longtime ally of the united kingdom in contravention of well established principles of international comity
9183070 failed to address in the light of allegations made by bm the abhorrence and condemnation accorded to torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment
9183071 nevertheless contended that the issues arising out of bms allegations of torture and cruel inhuman or degrading treatment were implicitly dealt with in his certificate
9183072 we do not consider that the issue arising out of the allegations made by bm is implicitly dealt with in these documents
9183073 gone to very considerable lengths to provide bm with assistance
9183074 been engaged in lengthy discussions which have led to the important changes
9183075 has been time consuming and burdensome and has rendered very real assistance to the interests of justice in this case

9183083 we have heard of the impious doctrine in the old world that the people were made for kings not kings for the people is the same doctrine to be revived in the new in another shape
9183084 we need a leader who understands all our security challenges not just bombs and guns but global warming global terror and global aids

9183088 promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
9183089 ours is a promise that says government should do that which we cannot do for ourselves
9183090 that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
9183091 if socrates had engaged in an interminable presidential campaign in a media drenched age perhaps he too would have come to seem banal but the fact that obama lost nine of the final 14 primaries might have something to do with the fact that when he descends from the ether to practicalities he reprises liberalisms most shopworn nostrums obamas rhetorical extravagances are inversely proportional to his details the diminished enthusiasm of some voters hitherto receptive to his appeals might have something to do with the seepage of reality from his rhetoric
9183092 the recent death of aleksandr solzhenitsyn should make us recall what he said when he was awarded the nobel prize the timid civilized world has found nothing with which to oppose the onslaught of a sudden revival of barefaced barbarity other than concessions and smiles what would a barack obama presidency mean other than more concessions and broader smiles while iran goes nuclear
9183093 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9183094 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war in iraq you dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying iraq you dont protect israel and deter iran just by talking tough in washington you cant truly stand up for georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances
9183095 but ive never gone around telling people things that arent true about me
9183096 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
9183097 imagine if it were the gop undergoing equivalent convulsions to those of the democrats lets say mitt romneys supporters demanded an open floor vote and were seething with public resentment against john mccain the way hillarys delegates are against obama add to that former president george h w bush verbally undercutting mccain at every opportunity in the manner of bill clintons anger toward obama regarding hillary because of say statements he made against his son the sitting president finally what if mike huckabee were involved in a cheating love child scandal the way john edwards is and had become so much of an embarrassment that like edwards he couldnt even speak to his own partys convention after winning lots of electoral votes is there any doubt that the democrats and the media elites would classify such a gop convention as the biggest fiasco in the history of party politics
9183098 if the iraqi government at that time decides that it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so

9183228 it is a story told by the ancient storytellers from grandmother to grandchild on down the line
9183229 tonight i wanted to speak of some of the spirit beings that native americans look to for guidance and direction the thunder beings are one such grouping of spirit beings that are mighty teachers and bring with them a time of renewed energy and creativity in fact they are currently also attending this gathering btw because there is a great storm right outside my window gggg so if i suddenly pop off its cause of their fire sticks came a little too close the thunder beings speak of the divine union which in the personal sense is the marriage between the male and female in each of us this marriage creates usable energy or enhances our natural growth potential by providing us with the get up and go we need to make our dreams a reality the thunder beings make up the love call of the sky nation the fire sticks or lightening bolts are a rare gift from father sky to his lover mother earth the thunderers who accompany a storm carry the mating call that announces the divine union of earth and sky the thunder beings are the host of lovers who give energy to the earth mother the thunder chief proclaims the beauty of the love between father sky and mother earth the fire sticks create a bridge between the two lovers and are a physical expression their love for one another through this intricate mating dance the earth mother is reenergized so that life may continue through the nurturing rains who feed her body since the earth is magnetic she needs the electric energy supplied by the thunder beings the rain people recycle the moisture of sky world and give back to the earth mother so that her body may feed all the things green and growing it is the cloak of father sky that covers the earth mother in a mantle of blue each day and the cloud people manifest his love for her every day when they form and the thoughts of their combined ideas take shape it is the hail lo way ain or the language of love in seneca that father sky speaks to the earth mother when mother earth needs the love and warmth of grandfather sun to support the needs of her children we see thunderstorms lightening rain as their bodies dance the sacred dance of the divine union the thunder chief calls out in the hail lo way ain the ancient language of love for the earth mother to prepare herself for her bridegroom the fire medicine the passion that comes between them is the fire sticks the lightning that returns needed energy to the earth mother this act of love between father and mother can be gentle and tender or torrid and passionate this lovemaking is experienced as climatic shifts and weather changes by the children of the earth floods and fires hailstorms and tornadoes hurricanes and typhoons are the freedom of nature in every case it is the fulfillment of our earth mothers needs and must be looked at from the viewpoint of the greatest good for all living creatures great mystery has a hand in all acts of the universe and this world and each act supports the need for growth and change how the thunder beings can help each of us when called upon the thunder beings as i said earlier are mighty teachers of change and renewal they are powerful medicine and should not be called upon lightly to aid a person there are times in our lives when change is inevitable growth is needed but is difficult for a variety of reasons mostly what we see in our own minds our personal renewal which nature reflects can be brought about by cleansing our fears cultivating new growth releasing old habits or allowing ourselves to be loved and protected the thunder beings bring us raw energy we need to renew and change reshape our lives we humans are catalyzers electromagnetic bodies receiving and giving energy we are the bridge that connects earth and sky when we are in harmony like mother earth and father sky we are both male and female in nature the command of usable energy comes when male and female are in balance within us by asking the thunder beings to assist us in tapping into this raw energy and utilizing it creatively we learn how to reshape and renew creatively grow and change when one comes to the thunder beings to seek assistance one must come in humbleness and humility with the intent of being an empty vessel or channel through which the energy may flow through us to be used as we need but also to return to the earth mother once it is no longer needed as we receive we must give back as well it is in using the language of love the hail lo way ain that we learn to walk in balance and to love ourselves as well the male and female of us each it is only in loving ourselves bringing the male and female side of each of us into harmony that we can begin to walk in beauty on the earth mother the thunder beings can show us the way but we must remember that what we take we must give back threefold as well and that what we do now on this plane will affect 7 generations of our children and our childrens children to take without gratitude or acknowledgment is imbalance to give too much to others without replenishing the self is imbalance to wait for energy to come to us without actively seeking what we need is imbalance the thunder beings teach us this balance there is neither hoarding misuse neglect leaking or denying the energy from father sky to mother earth when her need is fulfilled the storm is ended when she requires more rain and energy then father sky sends the fire sticks with the thunder beings to replenish his bride this then is the circle of the creative life force that naturally flows between us the original source great mystery use it properly or lose it first energy is neither good nor evil it just is its all in how we use it such also is the power and energy of the thunder beings also called wakinyan wakinyan brings storms that cut like a knife through the building heat of day wakinyan sends the lightning the fire sticks that flash and sear the booming voice of wakinyan can either give courage or instill deep dread great mystery created wakinyan to oversee the caretakers of the earth to assist them in their role wakinyan is electric energy and courses through all things wakinyan cleanses and destroys his great wings bring sudden and terrible winds the raw energy of wakinyans eye changes the vision of a human wakinyan is also the force of truth he strikes down anyone who does not speak the truth when holding the sacred pipe his spirit eye opens with the flash of lightning and sound of thunder careless use of wakinyans gift of energy means imbalance
9183230 yes it is also seen with a cup at the bottom of that lightening bolt ready to accept and hold the energy sent by the thunder beings this symbol is often carved on staffs or seen on medicine shields as a symbol of power yes balance is always the key one must be in balance in harmony in order to walk the path of beauty
9183231 i am not surprised as there is much similarity between eastern thought and native american it is only in the more modern christian jewish and muslim religions that this thinking of nature based balance and harmony shifted from the individual doing for the self to the individual being done to yes that is the path of beauty jack there are many roads to the same place

9183690 andrej is a perfect fit within our plan to rebuild the lightning into a contender
9183691 its hard letting go of players that we like but as we all know you cant get something for nothing
9183692 we needed to move assets in order to bring andrej to the lightning and we certainly feel we are a better more competitive team because of this trade lawton said
9183693 left something to be desired the last two seasons according to murray
9183694 to me it wasnt what we wanted to do murray said
9183695 i didnt think it was fair to the other guys to pump meszaros salary up to a point that was way beyond them
9183696 hes a real solid person hes a good player who can play the point on the power play in talking to him i think he was ready for a change to a market like ottawa
9183697 a local high end prospect the deal now gives the senators two first round picks in the 2009 draft
9183698 were getting another first round pick in a good draft year murray said
9183699 we have a chance to use those two picks to move up and get a higher pick or keep them and get two good players
9183700 it got to the point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay for meszaros murray said
9183701 we thought we made a considerable offer making this deal was an easier way and it gives us the return we needed for this player
9183702 with kuba smith volchenkov and phillips theyre all veteran guys and theyre all solid with the puck murray said
9183703 etwas panik in der box herrschte und mich mein ingenieur leider in den verkehr schicken musste
9183704 es ist nur noch wenig m glich aber im letzten rennen stand ich auf pole und am ende mit leeren h nden da f r morgen hoffe ich dass ich von platz 12 aus auf den richtigen reifen starte und alle anderen nicht dann wird viel m glich sein
9183705 und dann fahre ich hoffentlich nach vorne ziel ist es keine fehler zu machen und konstante zeiten zu fahren wo man dann landet kann man nie wissen
9183706 die strecke ist extrem kurz und so ist es schwer hier eine freie stelle zu finden das macht die strategie anspruchsvoller als gewohnt es ist definitiv schwierig hier alles richtig zu machen
9183707 l sst die taktik mehr spielraum als anderswo insofern hoffe ich dass sie funktioniert
9183708 wir konnten uns stets verbessern und die reifen haben gut funktioniert das ist sehr wichtig
9183709 es gibt noch einige kurven in denen wir schneller sein m ssen
9183710 die zweite session hat gezeigt wo ich h tte stehen k nnen das ist schade aber auch aus den top f nf heraus kann man noch einiges erreichen in der meisterschaft k nnte es nun nat rlich h rter f r mich werden aber dar ber will ich noch nicht nachdenken
9183711 beim ersten versuch hatte ich eine schlechte fliegende runde auch der letzte versuch hat nicht funktioniert ich kam im verkehr auf die strecke ich bin nicht rechtzeitig rausgefahren weil es in der boxengasse ein wenig panik gab
9183712 hull have signed defender paul mcshane on a season long loan deal from sunderland
9183713 i dont want the fans to think that i want to leave
9183714 i am happy at west ham i have just had a baby and i dont want to go anywhere i am really settled in my life and only want to work hard and do well for west ham
9183715 i am just looking forward to a bright future and when the time is right the deal will be done
9183716 all i am thinking about is pushing on this season and scoring more goals
9183717 i am happy with my current situation and hopefully i can carry on playing games and doing my best for west ham
9183718 but it is true there is a verbal agreement for a two year contract with everton and both clubs officials have agreed transfer details
9183719 i had a brief talk with the everton manager he has been very honest with me and explained the way he wants to use me it went smoothly
9183720 i am fit again i spent the whole pre season with united without feeling any pain
9183721 a few players have been knocking on my door but i always like to explain to them why theyre not in the side and how they can get back in
9183722 weve put a 7m bid on the table to manchester united
9183723 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian berbatov
9183724 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9183725 with the effects of the operation hitting home dad feels a bit rougher but the progress he made between the accident and friday was miraculous hence his being moved to a high dependency unit
9183726 it looks like hes past the worst and time will fix the broken bones
9183727 hes getting back to normal asking for a racing post each morning and he was delighted that our filly alphabeth won at wolverhampton on friday
9183728 dad is up and down moodwise and as youd expect he gets very upset when he thinks about tim
9183729 ive been winging around the world for the last 20 years and at long last im enjoying myself
9183730 ive never been fitter i ride out for sir michael stoute every day but i can no relax
9183731 ive suddenly found i can live a life i didnt have a life at all prior to my trial at the old bailey when i was cleared of all charges
9183732 how i rode in races with that trial handing over me ill never know but i will be back next year
9183733 nothing is more certain but im not attracted by the pathetic prizemoney in britain surely englands racing rulers will have to do something about it
9183734 i will be back in 2009 i will be stronger than ever good luck to johnny murtagh
9183735 solider of fortune is in the grosser preis von baden on sunday week but hes also entered for the tattersalls millions irish champion stakes at leopardstown the previous day
9183736 weve come in as underdogs and have hit our straps in every single department
9183737 the blokes have done an amazing job but we want to improve and want to try to win the series 5 0 if we can
9183738 we need to carry on and keep going the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9183739 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top
9183740 its up to the youngsters in the next two games to stick their hands up and stake a claim
9183741 ive got a dressing room that is a little bit down in confidence but well sit down and hammer home the basics again
9183742 its up to us to bring those young guys forward as quickly as we possibly can and the starting point for me is lords
9183743 we just had to give him a bit of time off after newbury as he wasnt quite right
9183744 hes been working well i thought he might be better for the race and he still might be
9183745 so many powerful moments post katrina on the gulf coast
9183746 from worshipping the sunday after the storm on a concrete slab that used to be our church home to gathering with all manner of people who were devastated by the destruction
9183747 everyone recognizes that faith groups were perhaps the backbone of recovery both on the coast and in jackson
9183748 after katrina a lot of different people ran off in a lot of different directions so the goal this time around and with each coming disaster is to be that much more organized
9183749 if you believe the word of generic cult 34 and you see the normal people rush and grab a copy because surely
9183750 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve

9184059 por qu hay un alto comisionado si no es capaz de resolver los problemas
9184060 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9184061 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9184062 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9184063 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9184064 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9184065 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9184066 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9184067 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9184108 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9184109 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

9184123 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9184124 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9184125 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9184126 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9184127 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9184128 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9184129 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9184130 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
9184131 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9184132 nunca los ej rcitos chileno y argentino han demostrado mayor grado de cooperaci n y fraternidad que durante la pacificaci n de la araucan a que los argentinos conocen como
9184133 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9184134 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9184135 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9184136 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9184137 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9184138 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9184139 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9184140 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9184141 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9184142 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9184143 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
9184144 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches

9184148 there is nothing wrong with one person saying to another on the day of d may allah accept it from us and from you
9184149 you will not eat anything today until the sun sets

9184161 prevent as many as 37 murders and more than 37 000 assaults in massachusetts each year
9184162 all too often the men and women in my office respond to crimes after theyve occurred its the nature of a prosecutors job we speak for victims after theyve been victimized
9184163 but what if we could prevent those crimes from happening in the first place i dont mean situational prevention like a metal detector or an armed guard to remove the opportunity to commit crimes i mean what if we could remove the factors that drive so many offenders to commit them
9184164 as a prosecutor ive been asked what can be done to reduce youth violence
9184165 in fact we believe early education is so effective as a crime fighting tool that the national district attorneys association the national association of attorneys general and the international association of chiefs of police have all endorsed early education as a crime prevention tool

9184170 than saving their season however the daily news know it all columnist is quite wrong if he
9184171 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9184172 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9184173 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9184174 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart

9184179 the idea that women are going to race off to vote for any candidate with the same internal plumbing is both offensive and historically wrong
9184180 suddenly you find youre out there walking in a storm
9184181 there is no blame on you for what you do by mistake but only for what your hearts have deliberately resolved upon
9184182 our lord do not take us to task if we forget or make a mistake
9184183 we broke our fast on one overcast day in ramadan during the time of allahs messenger peace be upon him then the sun reappeared
9184184 and eat and drink until the white thread becomes distinct to you from the black thread
9184185 this is only referring to the black of the night and the white of the day
9184186 continue to eat and drink until they could make out the color of the two strings
9184187 i have heard the criticisms of kimi but a few bad races does not mean you are in crisis
9184188 for me nothing has changed i have always had a contract for 2009
9184189 i feel bad to see a great champion like him not among the top ten at valencia but as for ferarri he can relax
9184190 no one should forget who is the world champion after he raikkonen did what not many predicted triumph in his first year 2007 with ferrari
9184191 kimi is motivated and we must work hard to help him qualify higher especially on all these new circuits that i do not like and that are bad for f1 you cannot overtake and nine times out of ten the winner is he who gets pole
9184192 the best of my ummah would be those of the generation nearest to mine then those nearest to them then those nearest to them
9184193 the month of ramadan is that in which the qur n was revealed
9184194 al aswad b yaz d used to complete reading the entire qur n every two nights in ramadan he would sleep between maghrib and ish outside of ramadan he would complete reading the qur n every six nights
9184195 he used to always observe his prayers in congregation and was constant in the recitation of the qur n he would always complete a reading of the entire qur n by friday however in ramadan he would do so every day and retreat to the eastern minaret of the mosque
9184196 he learned islamic law and read the qur n he was known for his charity and his good deeds in the month of ramadan he would read the qur n thirty times
9184197 umar b al khatt b ordered ubayy b ka b and tam m al d r to lead the people in prayer in ramadan they would each read hundreds of verses at a go until we had to support ourselves with canes due to the length of time we had to stand we would only finish praying close to the time of fajr
9184198 by the time we finished our prayers in ramadan the servants would have to rush to prepare food in fear of fajr coming in
9184199 the reciters leading the prayers would complete the reading of s rah al baqarah in eight units of prayer when the reciters took twelve units of prayer to complete it the people regarded it as if the reciters were making things easy for them
9184200 allahs messenger peace be upon him was the most generous of all people in doing good and he was at his most generous during the month of ramadan gabriel used to meet with him every year throughout the month of ramadan so the prophet could recite the qur n to him whenever gabriel met with him he became more generous than a beneficial breeze
9184201 it is liked for a person to increase his charity in the month of ramadan this is following the prophets example it is also in consideration of the peoples needs and their welfare since so many of them are distracted from earning their livelihood due to their preoccupation with fasting and prayer
9184202 whoever does not abandon false speech and acting falsely then allah has no need of his abandoning food and drink
9184203 if one of you starts off the day fasting he should avoid obscene speech and ignorant behavior if someone abuses him or starts to fight with him he should reply by saying i am fasting i am fasting
9184204 one does not merely fast from food and drink but also from lying from falsehood from vain talk and from swearing
9184205 fasting is not to leave off food and drink but rather to leave off lying falsehood and vain talk
9184206 when you fast then be on your guard as mush as possible
9184207 when you fast your hearing your vision and your tongue should also fast by avoiding lies and sins you should not abuse your servant you should maintain your composure and dignity on the day that you fast do not make your fasting day the same as your normal day
9184208 when you fast do not act in an ignorant manner and do not insult people if someone acts ignorantly towards you say i am fasting
9184209 if you avoid two things then your fast will be alright you must avoid backbiting and lying
9184210 a fasting person is engaged in worship as long as he does not backbite someone
9184211 cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
9184212 ours is a promise that says that government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that is that which we cannot do for ourselves
9184213 provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology
9184214 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead
9184215 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9184216 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9184217 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
9184218 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
9184219 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
9184220 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
9184221 creo que la convocatoria a refer ndum de la constituci n pol tica del estado cumple con una constante demanda de los sectores sociales e ind gena de bolivia que esperaban esta medida
9184222 ahora la propuesta de constituci n pol tica del estado que tanto ha costado hacer va ser aprobada o rechazada por el soberano a trav s de su voto y el gobierno tiene que hacer lo que el pueblo mande
9184223 no es m s que atender al pedido de los diferentes sectores del pa s que quieren decidir libremente sobre la aceptaci n de la propuesta de constituci n
9184224 efectivamente la propuesta de constituci n tiene muchas de nuestras demandas que haremos conocer a nuestras comunidades guaran es
9184225 incorpora y reconoce los derechos colectivos de los pueblos ind genas
9184226 los derechos de los pueblos ind genas y adem s derechos fundamentales de los diferentes grupos y clases sociales de bolivia especialmente de aquellos que durante muchos a os no fueron tomados en cuenta o eran utilizados por intereses indiviuduales
9184227 como pueblos queremos llegar al refer ndum y decidir con nuestro voto no estamos de acuerdo con aquellos grupos que se oponen a esta consulta porque lo que quieren es callarnos violando nuestro derecho a la libre expresi n
9184228 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano

9184232 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9184233 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9184234 le but de cette manifestation est dattirer lattention de lue sur le danger et sur labsence de perspectives que pr sente la mont e de la tension dans les relations avec la russie et dexprimer la volont de la diaspora russe de jouer un r le plus actif dans l tablissement du partenariat russie ue

9184241 democracy is threatened when legitimate national leaders are barred from what is arguably the single most important political event in an election the televised debates

9184249 i just calmed myself down and made sure i went back through my routine what got me into the final
9184250 since i joined the army in 2006 ive had nothing but the best training facilities and the absolute best teammates to push and support me
9184251 it makes such a huge difference and i truly believe theyve helped me fulfill a dream i dont think this wouldve ever happened without them
9184252 the army asked these young men to go and represent their military and the united states and they certainly made us proud
9184253 although when we spoke seven hours later each of them still had the same grins on their faces that they had at the medal ceremony

9184330 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9184331 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9184332 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9184333 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9184334 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work
9184335 as hillary clinton aptly stated senator mccain has a lifetime of experience
9184336 he will use that experience as president to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses grow the economy and reduce our nations independence on foreign oil

9184351 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet meanwhile john mccains wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave
9184352 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets
9184353 michelle obama must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
9184354 mccain and obama are as you probably know ideologically speaking they are completely different nominees for example one offers you hope and the other offers you a dish of hard candy
9184355 the nights big event was obamas speech in front of 75 000 enthusiastic supporters and eight confused broncos season ticket holders
9184356 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9184357 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9184358 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments

9184362 ela uniu democratas e republicanos em sua administra o e tem um hist rico de fazer a mudan a e a reforma que n s precisamos em washington
9184363 sarah palin uma escolha excitante do senador john mccain ela completa uma chapa firme que trar um verdadeiro compromisso de mudan a e reforma em washington
9184364 ela uma firme defensora dos tradicionais valores da fam lia com um compromisso inquestion vel de proteger a vida governadora palin sabe que precisamos buscar agressivamente fontes de energia como explora o das nossas reservas para reduzir a depend ncia de petr leo estrangeiro
9184365 she is smart vivacious and energetic she tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority and clearly has difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes
9184366 her approval ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 percent earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as closely as most reporters or legislators if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties
9184367 im confident that with an obama presidency we will have comprehensive immigration reform in the first term but its not going to be easy
9184368 an important part of the answer is not to have so many people who do not have legal status
9184369 whole detention system that is wrong and causing lots of suffering
9184370 although desirable i think it would be difficult to include fixing the detention and immigration judicial system in comprehensive immigration reform because it really wasnt a critical part of what came about last time
9184371 it doesnt mean that it shouldnt get done im just not sure if thats the best vehicle for it if the goal is to include these issues in comprehensive immigration reform then we have lots of work to do to make them front and center in this debate
9184372 we knew the senate mccain kenney bill was deeply flawed but we believed the legalization component for the 12 million immigrants was decent and the family reunification provisions could be fixed before the final passage
9184373 we cant wait any more when it comes to demilitarizing and improving enforcement and detention its what i hear in my district all the time all the time and things have gotten better for us democrats in the past 5 years
9184374 our side has to get tougher we cant afford to be as muted this time

9184379 in the passing away of dr kk birla within days of the passing away of his wife we have lost a couple that stood apart in high mindedness and public spiritedness sri krishnakumarji as he was affectionately known was an acute observer of national and international events and made important though discreet contribution to public policy including economic policy i offer my tribute to the memory of an outstanding social engineer an innovative newspaper owner and industrialist
9184380 i knew him for many years he was not just an industrialist i am deeply shocked and offer my condolence to members of the birla family
9184381 we have indeed lost a true son of india whose tireless efforts have benefited many sections of society his multidimensional contributions as an industrialist a caring philanthropist an astute parliamentarian and an eminent scholar leaves a rich legacy for many to emulate dr birlas passing away will leave a deep void in the industrial landscape of the nation

9184435 im using a satellite thats orbiting the asteroid and the rotation of the asteroid itself to wrap this ribbon

9184452 he didnt play very good in the first half he played really too frantic its a new offense for him but he settled down in the second half and kept us in the ball game
9184453 but sometimes wrong ends up being right the receivers ended up being bunched up but it was meant for us and thats what happened
9184454 hes starting to get comfortable at the quarterback position he can make plays with his feet and he can make plays with the ball

9184543 not dsl theres no mention of voip or voice services in conjunction with that service it is clearly described
9184544 we came up against a very very good football team
9184545 were bigger than they are thats what we expect our people to do and our hats off like crazy to coach simon and his crew they fought like crazy we felt like we were fortunate to do what we did and we were fortunate to get by with it
9184546 they came strong in the second half im not going to take anything away from them guys they worked hard as we did
9184547 but in the end it shows that whoever works the hardest will come out on top man tonight was just our night and i think god for everything that happened tonight
9184548 that gives us a little bit of momentum going into the half
9184549 at many times we still had letdowns we bent but we never broke weve got to credit our defensive guys they did an awfully good job
9184550 i thought he did a heck of a job and showed a lot of character
9184551 wills a good boy and im very proud of him under a lot of heat and stuff he did a heck of a job tonight
9184552 but we stuck in there and we got a w
9184553 ive been waiting on my junior season ever since i got here im finally here we did what we needed to do
9184554 ive been wanting to come to graham high school ever since i was in diapers man since i watched my cousin ahmad bradshaw now im trying to follow in his footsteps and just do all the right things weve got to do to come out on top
9184555 our players have been able to do it all along
9184556 were 2 0 thats the only quote we need tonight
9184557 people are beginning to believe in them they believe in themselves and the coaches do we have some weapons
9184558 its a long season and we have only played two games if we keep our confidence level high lets see how far we can go
9184559 this crowd right here theyve got a majority of the people back
9184560 theyre missing a couple of tailbacks right now one left and one got hurt but i can tell you they are a very very good football team
9184561 i dont like going into a game against a good team like east carolina with 41 percent of your players never having played in a game
9184562 i dont like that will make you nervous in a hurry but i do like the fact that we really do have some good young players
9184563 how can i not be excited im starting my first collegiate football game
9184564 im just going to go out there wide eyed and bushy tailed and do what i know how to do and play football
9184565 if they stack the line weve got to be able to throw it
9184566 we had a bunch of yards throwing last year and if we could have hit a couple more in certain situations i think we could have broken it open a little bit more
9184567 you go back and look at it youve got to give them credit theyre good theyve got guys that can run and theyre only a year older and stronger and more mature we didnt have enough yards running last year thats for sure
9184568 i remember the pinkney kid here last year he was third on the depth chart coming in but left out of here no 1
9184569 he threw the ball well you werent expecting him to perform as well as he performed here last year
9184570 hes athletic hes throwing the ball really well and from everything i read giving them great leadership hes the real deal
9184571 when you look at this team from a personnel standpoint theres a lot of experience on this football team which excites me
9184572 we really have a tough opener in east carolina you look at how they played down the stretch beating boise state in their bowl game
9184573 they have a lot of people back they are very strong up front defensively and offensively they have two great quarterbacks similar to us
9184574 this is really a good football team im very impressed with their football team it will be a true test for our football team in charlotte
9184575 the first game is big and i dont understand why some people dont think that
9184576 you have to take care of no 1 before you get to game no 2
9184577 i havent preached to them but i did tell them about what an upset is
9184578 an upset is when preparation meets opportunity when someone prepares and the opportunity is right theyll take it and its that simple
9184579 were going to go out and play well try to give a good account of ourselves and be as competitive as we can possibly can
9184580 we have a lot of pride here from a lot of guys that were recruited by i a schools and are here
9184581 we really have a long season and the west virginia game is a building blocks for what we think is the toughest i aa conferences in the country
9184582 coach talley has a veteran staff and they have 17 starters and 33 lettermen back from a 7 4 football team
9184583 this team is supposed to make a run at their conference and im hoping they do
9184584 i wish them nothing but the best but im also hoping they dont do that until september that way we wont have to worry but i know that wont be the case they will come in here and give us their best shot
9184585 our offenses are quite similar but the big difference is theyve got a heisman trophy candidate at quarterback
9184586 theyve got some awfully fine talent and theyve got their whole offensive line from last year is back
9184587 theyre regarded as one of the best offensive lines in the country so i dont think it will be scheme wise as much as it is the talent level that west virginia has
9184588 this is not a slam at the departed seniors but these guys are probably better athletes but theyre not gamers they dont have it on the field like those guys did
9184589 were replacing three guys that played a lot of football but these guys are as good or better those guys were but they havent done it they havent been out there
9184590 from what i told it is probably going to be the most hectic atmosphere that weve ever been in
9184591 i thought one of the atmospheres that was great was the air force academy when we played out there
9184592 it was very highly charged and a very difficult place to play but i think west virginia will be the toughest that weve been able to play in maryland last year was really loud and really hot and a great venue to play in but everyone tells me that this is a venue that is maybe the toughest in the country to play in
9184593 i worry as all coaches worry for all football games but i am worried about the mountaineers and what we do no matter who our opponent will be
9184594 we respect all and fear none we dont fear anybody and we certainly respect all
9184595 that being said the villanova wildcats will bring a very good bunch in here so we need to play our game to the best of our ability and go from there
9184596 illinois state is a good i aa team i encountered them at youngstown state throughout my years there as an assistant coach and we played them when i was coaching at minnesota
9184597 to unseat a starter you have to do something demonstratively well
9184598 weve got the best defense im ever going to play against their defense is nothing compared to ours
9184599 its one of the better teams in the nation it has been for quite some time
9184600 its a great opportunity for our program to play a team of that caliber
9184601 i think everyone is going to be a little bit nervous
9184602 its the first game and for a lot of guys its going to be their first start
9184603 we know whoever its going to be theyre going to be ready
9184604 we know theyre a solidly coached defense a very disciplined group i know its going to be a challenge for us
9184605 were a new team were trying to put our stamp on the usc tradition well find out a lot about ourselves on saturday
9184606 i really feel like were ready for any blitz situation they throw at us
9184607 if we can handle this situation we can handle anything the only way you become the best is to play the best i believe i hope were going to do special things
9184608 any time you get down like that in the first quarter its hard to dig your way out of that kind of a hole
9184609 but i have to give credit to these kids they never quit trying and they played their hearts out for 48 minutes and i cant ask any more than that
9184610 they came out here tonight played hard and played aggressive theyre a well coached disciplined group of kids thats the kind of thing you want to see out of an opponent
9184611 montcalm is young just like we were a few years ago
9184612 as soon as these kids get a little age on them theyll be fine
9184613 it was nice to be able to call a play and have it work
9184614 let the generals canon roar there will be no shut out tonight
9184615 in the past i havent had a hard time talking about our tailbacks because we would talk about one or two who were sharing the position
9184616 now i honestly have six who are in contention to be our starting tailback
9184617 lewis and cheeseman are back full strength and theyve been impressive evans and oglesby have been very good oglesby had a great offseason in coach mike gentrys conditioning program and has gotten bigger and stronger williams has a chance to be a special player
9184618 i got stronger and faster and added more to what i already had my film work with kenny has paid off i know all of the blitz packages pass protections and routes
9184619 in the huddle as soon as i get the play i know exactly what to do its been a 180 degree turn from the spring
9184620 i know what im doing now and i feel good about that it has given me more confidence
9184621 when you first come out here you have so many things to think about when you come up to the line of scrimmage once you know what to do everything slows down and your number one thought becomes performing well
9184622 im feeling really good i was initially told that i would not be able to play until the second or third game but i was cleared to play last month
9184623 i had to make sure i stayed in good condition thats a big thing with coach hite i doubled up on my rehabilitation and came to the training room two or three times a day
9184624 he wants to have a group of guys he can turn to
9184625 we have a lot of talent in the backfield right now he will put on the field only those players who are ready to play and do not make him nervous but rather give him confidence
9184626 there should be a simple easily implementable kernel to the lisp that
9184627 there should be a simple easily implementable kernel to the lisp that
9184628 there should be a simple easily implementable kernel to the lisp
9184629 we want to impress on our kids that if you work hard good things will happen
9184630 iaeger was well prepared going into this season we knew we had some inexperience and we knew we couldnt make mistakes we had several costly mistakes tonight
9184631 we told our guys if you want it youll make things happen we went out and didnt stay in our lanes and had poor tackling weve got to be more disciplined
9184632 im just real proud of the kids we were really pleased with our running attack tonight and with our defense
9184633 we knew that coming in we played more kids than honaker and we kind of wore them down in the second half
9184634 we just didnt finish from the second quarter on we got out played we executed gave our quarterback plenty of time to throw and we were doing a lot of good things there early i dont know if we got tired or what happened but from midway of the second quarter on we just got our butts kicked
9184635 we didnt play smart again but im seeing improvement i thought we blocked better tonight we battled back we got behind but we never quit thats always a good sign weve got some young kids but theyre getting better
9184636 the line gave joel time to throw the ball i thought that was the key we picked up their stunts and gave joel time to throw
9184637 its fun to get a win on the first night on the new turf
9184638 evil pursueth sinners but to the righteous good shall be repayed

9184644 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity he said
9184645 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
9184646 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets mr clarke said
9184647 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
9184648 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale he said
9184649 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
9184650 unfortunately this has required the departure of many talented employees to date and will see a further reduction in headcount by up to 50 per cent by the end of june 2009 as we accelerate our restructuring program he said
9184651 the reconstruction of the group is progressing however the business remains in a fragile position and the continued market weakness is making the task difficult mr clarke said
9184652 we are committed to creating a leaner and simpler to understand company with realistic growth opportunities
9184653 we plan to continue to diversify and broaden our fleet with greater exposure to the growth segments particularly in high margin niche areas like lpg and offshore supply mr clarke said
9184654 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
9184655 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
9184656 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
9184657 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
9184658 we are actively engaging the federal government to reconsider the extent of the mls threshold uplift as well as its approach to premium pricing he said
9184659 we continue to monitor developments and have a number of plans in place to address the impact if the proposed changes are legislated
9184660 as a result we plan to carefully move to a more defensive investment asset allocation to reduce investment earnings volatility
9184661 mindful of merger and acquisition opportunities given inevitable industry consolidation
9184662 we have a strong capital position with 105 6 million in excess capital above our internal target and an ungeared balance sheet enabling us to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities as they arise and undertake capital management initiatives
9184663 as an initial step we plan to undertake a on market share buy back of up to 10 per cent of issued shares mr fitzgibbon said

9184678 sarah palin is a strong vice presidential pick that represents a fresh breath of air for those looking for representation in this election and someone who will make a difference in washington dc as a soon to be mom myself i admire what sarah palin has been able to achieve as both a professional executive rising to the level of governor as well as being a mom of five children with three daughters one son off to iraq in only a few weeks and a baby boy with the challenges of downs syndrome she has been a successful manager both of a state and her family one of the issues important to me is the pain we all face at the pump there is no one that knows the issue of rising oil prices and how we can solve this problem better than someone who knows alaska and its issues like sarah palin lastly i cant stop thinking of the irony that hillary clinton was able to get so many women excited about politics and what a woman could do but it is the republican party not the democrat party that is leading the way and elevating a smart and qualified woman like sarah palin to its 2008 ticket to win the white house i feel confident that governor palin should be able to carry on the mantle left to her by geraldine ferraros 1984 run connect with women as a new and refreshing face and close the deal to help us win in 2008 as a young professional and mom to be i am looking forward to campaigning for the mccain palin ticket

9184684 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9184685 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9184686 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9184687 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9184688 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9184689 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9184690 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9184691 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9184692 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9184693 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9184694 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9184695 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9184696 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9184697 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9184698 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9184699 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9184700 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9184701 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9184702 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9184703 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9184704 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9184705 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9184706 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9184707 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9184708 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9184709 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9184710 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9184711 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9184712 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9184713 who are open to doing something on the production side
9184714 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9184715 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9184716 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9184717 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9184718 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9184719 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9184720 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9184721 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9184722 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9184723 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9184724 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9184725 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9184726 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9184727 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9184728 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9184729 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9184730 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9184731 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9184732 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9184733 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9184734 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9184735 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9184736 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9184737 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9184738 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9184739 he is one of the few characters who knows he is in a comic and acts accordingly
9184740 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9184741 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9184742 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9184743 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9184744 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9184745 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9184746 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9184747 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9184748 i mean youve got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a story book man
9184749 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
9184750 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
9184751 in our minds there are significant cracks in the agricultural economy story and the recent pullbacks in their beneficiaries are not overwhelmingly positive
9184752 indeed the opposite may be true specifically some of the excessive enthusiasm should raise alarm bells not cheers
9184753 if his joint makes an appearance ill give him a 400 haircut he wont soon forget
9184754 i was wrong i got caught sneaking around with someone who wasnt my wife and it ruined my career i now realize i should have become a university president so that when i got caught pouring beer down some girls throat id get a 400 000 severance package instead of having to shell out a couple million to try to keep things quiet

9184783 for a tiny child the mmr is a ridiculous thing to do it has definitely caused autism
9184784 effective treatment for autism could begin only once the psychoanalytic approach was abandoned it wasnt possible to develop educational interventions while autism was blamed on the mythical refrigerator mother the unfeeling over intellectual career woman
9184785 its my opinion that psychoanalysis has nothing whatever to offer autistics i mean the talking treatment for children with no language i know one case a boy of 12 who didnt speak the analyst played chess with him for a year and a half psychoanalysts dont know beans about special education theyre a bunch of failed poets they work with symbols and autistic people dont understand symbols to them a tree is a tree

9184803 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9184804 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9184805 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9184806 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9184807 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9184808 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work

9184826 they will see no benefits from the revenue raised but bear all the burden of the project
9184827 this is not financially going to make sense this is not going to environmentally make sense
9184828 we could still do all that drilling but the risk and cost would be on the government all this does is flip it onto the contractor
9184829 theres specific language in the bill that any oil extracted must maintain the same environmental footprint that exists now

9184833 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
9184834 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
9184835 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
9184836 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
9184837 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
9184838 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence
9184839 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
9184840 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs

9184845 media speculation is always a matter of claim and counter claim bluff and spin truth and distortion but todays news reports on councils and housing associations being given the power to help first time buyers with deposits in return for an equity stake by buying up newly built empty properties and introducing some sort of national sale and leaseback scheme have more than a ring of truth about them in policy terms what is being suggested is entirely sensible while arresting the steep decline in house prices should not be an end in itself the risk that a collapse in house prices will tip the economy into serious recession is too strong to be ignored

9184877 we understand that some viewers were upset but we signalled the nature of the content of the episode through the pre programme continuity announcement and billings
9184878 it was a well written well acted episode which should be praised especially the young actor who played jay
9184879 the hd 4870 has been quite the performer from the word go but its in our blood that we have the need for even more power this is where overclocking comes into play and today palit has placed the hd 4870 under their sonic naming scheme which means we get a nice little out of the box overclock palit hasnt just bumped the clock speeds up though theyve also decided to change it by removing the boring reference cooler that weve been seeing for so long and adding their own design before we check out the cooler and the clocks the new hd 4870 sonic from palit offers well quickly take the time to have a look at the package to see if theres anything inside the box to get excited about

9184928 however they trust that obama is not a war president they also recognise that biden is a sharp foreign policy man
9184929 obamas choice of deputy confirms that the real change he is after is a personal one to leap from his seat in the senate to the presidential chair
9184930 biden is a firm supporter of israel but the way he sees the uss role in the middle east doesnt necessarily reflect jerusalems ideal of the ideal american partner

9185293 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9185294 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9185295 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9185296 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9185297 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9185298 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9185299 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9185300 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9185301 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

9185312 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9185313 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9185314 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

9185334 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9185335 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9185336 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9185337 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9185338 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9185339 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9185340 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9185341 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9185342 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9185343 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9185344 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9185345 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9185346 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9185347 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9185348 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9185349 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9185350 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9185351 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9185352 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9185353 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9185354 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9185355 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9185356 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9185357 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9185358 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9185359 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9185360 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9185361 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9185362 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9185363 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9185364 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9185365 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

9185386 thats why so many of the mainstream churches get caught up with false ppl like this not saying that its easy to pick because it is very deceptive

9185388 theres also something called oh yeah grace thank god jesus doesnt have the same mindset you do or wed all be lost dont we all know we shouldnt sin or is his sin unforgivable and your sin is something that can be overlooked or easily forgiven

9185390 it is seriously shaking peoples faith which above all should be the main thing to pray for as for my own reaction when i found out earlier today well i felt sick i felt angry sad confused misled you name it so to all of you feeling the same but then maybe feeling guilty for being emotional dont ofcourse we are going to be emotional from news like this but i hope that like myself you can ask the lord to help you forgive and keep your hearts soft

9185396 we commend the arrest and the deportation of one of the key members of the rajah solaiman movement lavillas arrest is not only a big boost in our fight against global terrorism but also clearly shows that the long arm of the law will definitely catch any fugitive whether in the country or abroad

9185405 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9185406 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9185407 gordon brown has briefed out stories that he has an economic recovery plan all worked out meanwhile the chancellor says the downturn will be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9185408 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9185409 i sincerely miss those heavy metal bands i used to go see on the landing in the summer
9185410 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year

9185430 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9185431 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9185432 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9185433 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9185434 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9185435 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9185436 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9185437 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9185438 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9185439 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9185440 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9185441 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9185442 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

9185447 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9185448 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9185449 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9185450 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9185451 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9185452 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9185453 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9185454 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9185455 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9185456 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9185457 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9185458 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9185459 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9185460 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9185461 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9185462 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9185463 in our minds there are significant cracks in the agricultural economy story and the recent pullbacks in their beneficiaries are not overwhelmingly positive
9185464 indeed the opposite may be true specifically some of the excessive enthusiasm should raise alarm bells not cheers

9185480 i expected more from the players and when you look at the game as a whole they deserved their win
9185481 after the break we did not have enough power and may be it was a little bit too much for our young guys after playing two games in a week
9185482 we looked vulnerable in defence and we played too much to give a show but we have to play to get winning results
9185483 there were a lot of chances for both teams but we are delighted to get all three points
9185484 there were several blocks and they hit the woodwork and the way our season is going you thought that southampton would get an equaliser
9185485 but credit to my players because they dug in deep and we deserved the win

9185489 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9185490 we always said we wanted to be the best team in the world
9185491 our goal now is to make sure the guys dont talk about their talent but they deliver their talent
9185492 i just want the guys to do as much as they can and to deliver deliver deliver
9185493 there is a lot of mediocrity that people settle for in this country in terms of county cricket
9185494 i want to get better and better and better every single time i practise
9185495 then you can entertain when you go out because you know you have done the hard yards before
9185496 as a kid i always wanted to be the best to win everything at school
9185497 driving my car i dont like losing at the lights i have a pretty good wagon as well so that helps
9185498 i dont like coming second so i will do anything to win if its fair and its legal
9185499 the effect it has had on the team right now is amazing a score of 3 0 is an absolute thrashing
9185500 the way we have done it is so convincing we havent looked like losing thats the best thing about it
9185501 whether it is 3 2 4 1 or 5 0 the guys in that dressing room know we have cleaned south africa up which is remarkable
9185502 a series win is a series win and the guys will take a lot of encouragement from this to wherever we go from here
9185503 the bowling unit is 100 the strongest ive played with for england
9185504 the batting department if we had marcus trescothick at the top of the order that could strengthen our side but as far as i see it to beat south africa 3 0 the second ranked side in the world its a pretty special team weve got going
9185505 to get tres back in the team would be massive
9185506 it would be great i just feel sorry for the county bowlers who he is smashing at the moment but he is a man on his own and hes got his reasons
9185507 he came back 100 for cricketing reasons i can promise that because i begged him and begged him
9185508 we have talked about it but why shouldnt he have a right to play in it
9185509 i ran around the field and i was really unsure about certain things and how to handle it
9185510 because i thought ive got 24 hours in the job i have got to deliver here i put so much pressure on myself
9185511 since i took the job over i have thought just do your best trust your gut

9185558 boeing believes that its offer which is actually quite good would appeal to the workers if only presented to them directly the company seems to have confused public relations with collective bargaining
9185559 machinists have followed leaders voting recommendations in three of the last four negotiations stopping work over two of them to gain contract improvements the most recent walkout shaved 300 million from boeings second half earnings in 2005
9185560 boeing dropped most plans the union had termed strike issues and offered a package that would boost overall average compensation including overtime bonuses and benefits by 23 percent over three years to 110 400
9185561 all our members want is a little bit of the pie theyve helped create the offer fell short in job security as well as health care wages time off pensions profit sharing and other issues

9185572 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
9185573 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet

9185670 successfully hijacked un institutions to impose its own radicalized agenda
9185671 neither the conservatives nor the liberals have any interest in this their effort is to appease these islamist groups they dont wish to offend and therefore the islamists can walk over and literally blackmail politicians and the liberal intelligentsia into not saying a word about it
9185672 those who advocate freedom of expression often go on to deny the equal right to be protected from advocacy of hatred the holocaust did not begin with censorship it began with hate speech auschwitz was built with words the killing fields of cambodia were sowed with slogans the genocide of rwanda was spread by radio bosnia was ethnically cleansed by television
9185673 the time constraints on me and resource constraints too meant i havent been able to do anything comprehensively so what ive really aimed to do is just make sure i spoke to a representative group those who have grave reservations and those who support the idea so that i would hopefully get the full range of perspective

9185684 it shows who is getting infected now and where we need to direct resources for prevention testing linkage to care and partner notification
9185685 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
9185686 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
9185687 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
9185688 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
9185689 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer

9185692 we have been successful in creating a very powerful and robust preclinical model of stroke to help us get a clearer picture of what causes this condition thus improving the efficacy of our treatment
9185693 the new model has the ability to screen drugs for their effectiveness in treating stroke patients and bridges the translational gap between laboratory and clinical research
9185694 minimizing injury to the brain in a stroke affected patient is the key improved preclinical models help us understand the biology of strokes and guide us in developing effective therapeutics
9185695 we developed a highly sophisticated experimental system including a novel surgical approach and state of the art post image processing that lends itself to identifying the cause of stroke as well as investigating the effectiveness of pharmacological therapies
9185696 we are hopeful that this new approach to study stroke biology and intervention in a preclinical model will prove to be an effective tool to address stroke as a major cardiovascular disease in humans

9185710 football has moved on and both of these clubs have moved on from some of the things that have gone on in the past
9185711 were at the liberty stadium and cardiff are looking forward to moving to their new ground there are a lot more women and children coming to games
9185712 we can be positive its a fantastic draw and we look forward to a great night for welsh football

9185818 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives the group is also hoping to be able to respond if an outside conservative group broadcasts a television advertisement attacking senator barack obama or another democratic candidate by running commercials exposing the donors behind the advertisements

9185822 this years theme is freedom with entries from around the world especially woodstocks sister city nimbin australia the village that was founded on the values of woodstock nation
9185823 weve also been talking with the folks at winston farm the saugerties site of the 1994 25th anniversary concert about placing a museum there
9185824 weve got some wild things showing that if all true are enough to blow anyones mind
9185825 the whole idea is to get people thinking beyond the norm
9185826 freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose

9185843 a hijacked church bell announcing the party of the year
9185844 i hadnt really figured out what to do with it but when we were working on norweigan wood it just needed something it was quite spontaneous i just picked it up and found the notes and it just seemed to hit the spot
9185845 telling all those lies about the good things that we can have if we close our eyes
9185846 now my advice for those who die declare the pennies on your eyes
9185847 in their sties with all their backing they dont care what goes on around in their eyes theres something lacking what they needs a damn good whacking
9185848 youll have them all pulled out after the savory truffle

9185853 do you still think you want them think you can be ok with cats
9185854 a cat wont cost you as much money to care for and you can just leave it in your apartment all the time you could even adopt one thats already trained
9185855 a girl i work with is moving and her new landlord wont let her have her cats there
9185856 theyre really good cats and i thought maybe you would be interested in taking them
9185857 remember i said i only want one cat one cat will be enough what would i do with two
9185858 but two is even better when you think about it that way you can leave them alone in your apartment and not worry because theyll keep each other company and these cats seem perfect you could take just one of them if you wanted but they were raised together so she wants to try to keep them together

9185873 im an unbiased jury and i decide which one you gets to win the hamper and guess who is the winner its a tie and the reason behind it is simple we the doves are the symbol of peace and that is what we wish for though we all belong to the same class of birds why is that we dont find peace amongst ourselves is it just because that we look different and our habits are different if you wish to experience peace provide peace for another
9185874 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane

9185878 i know some people may be irritated but i think these subjects have to be dealt with
9185879 i never asked if it was a good or a bad thing
9185880 my story is about a couple who have lost a child i tried to deal with their sorrow with a certain distance and respect without being melodramatic
9185881 i never felt we were being insensitive or treading on peoples toes
9185882 having seen fabrices first film i realised he wouldnt deal with mourning and the loss of a child in a normal way
9185883 for people in the west death is a taboo its fearful and dizzying
9185884 in thailand there is this idea that death is continuative
9185885 they believe certain souls have to be released because theyre stuck between two levels we the living are holding them back
9185886 fabrice wanted to know if i could go on this journey with him without a caravan make up artists and so on
9185887 come presidente del consiglio presi atto delle legittime richieste di una importante struttura scientifica della regione emilia romagna e nel rispetto delle norme e delle leggi ho chiesto agli organismi competenti di valutarne le istanze nella veste di zio e quindi in forma assolutamente privata ho ascoltato le richieste di un mio nipote e gli ho dato dei consigli
9185888 avete visto come sono farabutti i giornalisti i suoi e ora di impedirgli di pubblicare le intercettazioni
9185889 solidariet con prodi e un copione gi visto deve intervenire il parlamento
9185890 sono davvero dispiaciuto per lennesima puntata della vicenda intercettazioni che stavolta colpisce romano prodi e fin troppo evidente che sono allopera delle vere e proprie fabbrichette di veleni
9185891 ha dato prova della sua indiscutibile statura etica a dire di pubblicare le sue intercettazioni ma il problema rimane non pu essere lui o un altro a decidere una legge serve e subito
9185892 la mossa politica di di pietro di buttarsi come uno sciacallo sui resti dellabruzzo sventolando la bandiera della legalit per ottenere una valanga di voti

9185896 it is unfathomable to me as an american and a world citizen that anyone would vote for that man
9185897 he served his country and he did a good job as a serviceman i will honour him for that but he is not presidential material
9185898 emergency personnel firefighters and law enforcement all over the state have been asking for this reform for many years calema will make the state more responsive when disaster strikes
9185899 everyone saw the devastating effects of hurricane katrina and the poor response by the federal government we want to make sure that california s emergency response and recovery system works effectively and efficiently and can respond to the needs of its residents
9185900 this bill will provide californians with a convenient and easy way to contribute to this cancer fund to improve educational outreach and prevention strategies
9185901 it is a sad day if the republicans decided not to vote for this badly needed measure because they disagree with some of the california supreme court s recent decisions i find it ironic that the same people who say the courts should not legislate from the bench attempted to hold the judicial system hostage through the legislative process
9185902 many of california s courthouses are outdated and unsafe and that s unacceptable
9185903 this legislation will ensure our courts can do their jobs and deliver justice in a safe manner for all sb 1407 pays for these important improvements with a lease revenue bond that does not take from the state s general fund
9185904 ab 2747 pushes suicide through the back door at the hands of non physicians taking advantage of depressed patients
9185905 ab 2747 cheapens the value of human life by endorsing suicide as an option governor schwarzenegger should pledge to veto this very dangerous bill
9185906 ab 2747 allows a physician assistant or a nurse to opine that a patient is terminal and then push for unnatural death by palliative sedation
9185907 depressed patients who succumb to this pressure will be drugged unconscious and die from dehydration usually within five to 10 days nothing in the bill prohibits this horror
9185908 los angeles desperately needs to improve our transportation system people spend too much time in their idling cars sitting in traffic rather than at home with their families
9185909 this bill enables los angeles residents to transform our region

9185927 do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan if you do and they cry out to me i will certainly hear their cry my anger will be aroused and i will kill you with the sword your wives will become widows and your children fatherless
9185928 but if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea see that you do not look down on one of these little ones for i tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my father in heaven your father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost
9185929 religion that god our father accepts as pure and undefiled is this to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world
9185930 though my father and mother forsake me the lord will receive me
9185931 there is nothing in life like a child that you can nurture and love the reciprocation of that love and nurturing is a thousand times more beneficial to you than it is to the child
9185932 you cannot walk a true path of faith without the help of orphans and widows
9185933 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
9185934 whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
9185935 you can show me you love me best by taking care of those i love
9185936 love the lord your god with all your heart all your mind all your strength and all your soul and love your neighbor as yourself
9185937 the world must learn that i love the father and that i do exactly what my father has commanded me
9185938 whoever serves me must follow me and where i am my servant will also be my father honors the one who serves me
9185939 jesus replied if anyone loves me he will obey my teaching
9185940 thank you god for using me for such a mission as this
9185941 thank you god for the orphan im changed because of them youve rent my heart and at the same time poured more of your love deep inside me ill never be the same again and for that i am eternally grateful

9185998 it is beyond question that by acting in the way that he did mr khan killed mr brown unlawfully and whatever their differences the fact is that mr brown lost his life
9185999 that is a consequence for which mr khan must be punished with a significant custodial sentence
9186000 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family

9186074 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognizant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9186075 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9186076 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9186077 by persistently inviting the most notorious human rights abuser in india and propping narendra modi as their icon and hero the organisers of the world gujarati conference have brought shame to the indian american community and have tarnished the name of india

9186110 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement

9186122 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
9186123 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

9186139 das was ihn weininger besch ftigt ist eine signaturenlehre eine solche signaturenlehre liegt in der boehmischen philosophie in der gesagt wird da alle dinge ihre innere signatur auch u erlich offenbaren da die signatur das innere und das u ere bezeichnet da der leib aller dinge des geistes signatur ist und da jedes menschen tierische eigenschaft auch u erlich eine signatur hat wodurch unterscheidet sich die symbolik weiningers von den signaturenlehren seiner vorg nger der psychologische ansatz ist unverkennbar wiederholt sei da f r weininger die psychischen ph nomene keine erscheinungen im sinne kants waren er entwirft eine ethische signaturenlehre das ethos des symbols wird gewertet die physis ist symbol der psyche

9186146 we come here to play for this weekend together i feel like being together is everything
9186147 i am somewhat disappointed because i know we definitely couldve taken first
9186148 i think we just overlooked str8 a little at first
9186149 we just went out on some race set up and got going pretty good pretty consistent
9186150 it was a pretty clean session everything went pretty good we made some changes to the bike last night and made it better hopefully it will be a good race
9186151 yeah know honestly i havent hit it the same twice
9186152 theres no braking markers down there so im just kind of winging it on the brakes in there
9186153 its a very tricky corner i like it i think its really fun its a lot better than the last corner but its definitely really tricky for sure it adds another thing to the track another passing zone where you really unless you just go roger hayden style youre not going to get somebody in the last corner it makes another passing opportunity and its safer so i like it like i just cant hit it twice really right to save my life but were getting there

9186155 from the time we arrived in january there was a local demand for generators throughout the city
9186156 initially the project was sub divided by precincts and eventually it became a city wide project of providing the 35 generators
9186157 we trained and certified operators who are responsible for keeping residents connected and keeping the generator operating using preventive maintenance
9186158 the operators are obligated to ensuring the generators provide a minimum of seven hours of power on a daily basis to offset the shortage of national power
9186159 we have only had four days together as a team
9186160 the result was pretty good we still have lots of work to do and much to improve on but i was satisfied with the full effort we gave we just have to go to back to work this week and prepare for the next meet
9186161 i thought the timing of the goal was really the critical factor in tonights game
9186162 to give up a goal so early in each half had a big influence on the match i thought the lads battled and worked hard i thought we could have been in the match the timing of goals is critical in the game of soccer and tonight they came at very bad moments
9186163 i thought parker duncan caused them a lot of problems in the first half up front
9186164 i also think that rory oconnor really played a solid game for us on the defensive end thomas shannon continues to get better game by game there is some real optimism about some of our young players these guys will continue to battle for positions all season long
9186165 a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that ucla is cheating on admissions
9186166 hes taking an outcome and from that deducing a cause
9186167 they caved under the pressure from the naacp and others in los angeles who want to see an increase in the number of black students
9186168 there are so many ways you can rig the system
9186169 it is obvious that the admissions staff was under intense pressure to admit more african americans
9186170 because i cannot properly conduct the duties with which i am charged as a member of cuars i am therefore resigning in protest from the committee
9186171 to do otherwise would condone and make me complicit in what appears to be illegal activity
9186172 well continue to have some of these issues that crop up from time to time and the only thing we can do is be prepared for knowing well occasionally encounter errors and fix them quickly

9186177 the bottom line is youve got a major internecine battle a kind of civil war among drug cartels
9186178 it has intensified because the stakes are high theres a great deal of money to be made
9186179 youre sending a signal to the calderon government to the police that you mean business
9186180 this is the result when you dont play ball with us

9186211 it helped me realize the extent of damage that was done
9186212 this is an important piece of the assessment process for determining when a player is ready to return to play
9186213 it will help reduce the number of injuries because if we return a player too early research shows theyre at a three times greater risk of receiving another concussion

9186259 that was my second set to win really once it gets to 5 5 i kind of let it slip away

9186372 drinking some kool aid that is not very relevant to this election
9186373 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either we love her hillary clinton but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
9186374 those of us who have been clamoring for photo id for voting have been blocked by democrats who keep claiming such a requirement would disenfranchise the poor and the elderly it is time to call their bluff produce six people who dont have photo ids they dont exist they certainly dont try to buy alcohol fly take out a library book withdraw money from a bank rent a movie write a check at a grocery store rent a car take a cruise take metal in for recycling drive pick up tickets at will call buy cigarettes or get treated at the doctors office about all you can do without an id is breathe everyone has them ok you got me there may be some poor soul in a coma but theyre not supposed to vote
9186375 if john mccain thinks that he can substitute sarah palin for hillary clinton in the minds of hillary clinton supporters hes sadly mistaken i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9186376 shes been governor of alaska for eighteen months and before that she was the mayor of a town of 8 000 people
9186377 shes already under investigation by her states legislature they voted to spend 100 000 on an investigation because she is accused of firing a state commissioner who refused to fire her sisters husband this is not the kind of change that we need

9186415 what its a lemon with a new horn ill take it
9186416 exactly who i need exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and the country second
9186417 i cant begin this great effort without honouring the achievement of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course hillary clinton who showed determination in her presidential campaign
9186418 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9186419 as for that vp talk all the time i cant answer until someone answers me what is it exactly that a vp does every day
9186420 im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that this vp slot would be fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the kind of things we are trying to accomplish here for the rest of the us
9186421 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9186422 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9186423 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9186424 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9186425 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9186426 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9186427 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9186428 the average american is reluctant to second guess the conduct of a service person in a combat zone
9186429 to end the war that were engaged in lets make sure we have a plan here respecting senator mccains position on that
9186430 to find some kind of a resolution of the intra iraqi and us iraqi differences as as to allow a graceful exit

9186435 newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment
9186436 another interesting source of investment information is newsletters that you can buy for a few hundred dollars per year the investment results of some of these newsletters look impressive and they should in 1985 the u s supreme court ruled that newsletters were exempt from the investment advisors act of 1940 and therefore not subject to sec regulation that means courts view newsletters as journalistic works and as a result newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment
9186437 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know

9186482 we think there is a correlation between the disappearance of dinkadubo tribe members and a possible huge freaking turtle living in lake victoria
9186483 lawrence knew that even a turtle 10 feet across might be hard to find because of the size of the lake so a boat was required if there was any chance of spotting the animal
9186484 and we all gasped thats huge for a turtle so we got closer to it and we were all shocked to realize that the entire lump was only the turtles head i remember wesley saying youre gonna need a bigger boat right before he soiled himself
9186485 thats when lawrence said we had overreacted and we were sending the wrong message to people
9186486 he said we should sail out to the creature and try to interact with it like the way some people do with sharks wesley and i said we thought it wasnt a very wise thing to do but he decided to sail out on his own to interact with the turtle
9186487 lawrence made it to within a short distance of the turtle and was trying to talk to it
9186488 wesley snapped a picture right before the turtle ate lawrence and the boat
9186489 if we had a bigger boat the turtle probably would have just swam away
9186490 but it would have been less exciting thats for sure

9186561 this means the county council will only have to put up a quarter of the cost of a new library for westport castlebar and ballina have libraries five times the size of westport and this highlights how far behind westport has fallen in the provision of such a vital public service
9186562 i am delighted to see that the new buildings programme is currently seeking applications from local authorities for new libraries and i have written to the county manager des mahon the town manager peter hynes director of service joe loftus and county librarian austin vaughan and asked them to put together an application for westport
9186563 the department will provide funding for a new building and while it says funding will be decided on
9186564 because westport library is too small and outdated to serve the huge population area in south west mayo a very good case can be made to the department for building a new library in westport as part of the proposed civic building development proposed for the convent
9186565 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidates for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you

9186570 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
9186571 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
9186572 the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
9186573 poured everything she had into me i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9186574 made clear we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
9186575 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

9186603 the powder is fda approved and is already being used for hernia repairs and other applications
9186604 but it has never been used for this reason in people
9186605 this is a topic the army and department of defense are interested in because when injuries happen in war most of them are extremity injuries
9186606 with burns in particular we commonly end up with loss of digits
9186607 since the powder was fda approved and safe for use we figured we would try it
9186608 the idea was out there that it might work for this application but it had never been tried on humans
9186609 when put onto open wound it seems the body starts to regrow normal tissue
9186610 you pull a tail off a salamander and it regrows

9186614 thats why were testing it on fingers vs legs if we apply it to a leg amputee the downside is the soldier wont be able to walk for several months and it may not work
9186615 the first time we saw an increase in length of the finger but the wound closed before further growth could occur
9186616 but were not sure how long it will take or if it will even work
9186617 if we have a soldier who was blown up by an ied and missing fingers and we have a chance to give him his fingers back increase his function how can we not try

9186644 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche

9186647 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9186648 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

9186655 no es m s que atender al pedido de los diferentes sectores del pa s que quieren decidir libremente sobre la aceptaci n de la propuesta de constituci n

9186658 los derechos de los pueblos ind genas y adem s derechos fundamentales de los diferentes grupos y clases sociales de bolivia especialmente de aquellos que durante muchos a os no fueron tomados en cuenta o eran utilizados por intereses indiviuduales

9186853 i just want to tell you straight from the source kerchoonz was not designed to beat anyone kerchoonz was designed to provide free and legal access to music and art and help compensate the creators at the same time it is not in competition with myspace or youtube pirates or anyone else in fact the site encourages users to post links to myspace and youtube and any other social networking site
9186854 not because more people are accessing or listening to their music but because less and less people are willing to take the risk to invest in new music these days
9186855 myspace and facebook have 200 million users between them they have got the audience and the content to bring the audience to the website and its going to be a very big undertaking to be able to compete on the same level with that

9186926 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9186927 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9186928 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9186929 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9186930 its not going to change its not a family show
9186931 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are

9186935 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
9186936 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
9186937 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen

9186939 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9186940 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9186941 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9186942 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9186943 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9186944 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9186945 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9186946 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9186947 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9186948 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9186949 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about

9186978 i would characterize the senate race as being a race where obama was lets say blessed and highly favored thats not routine theres something else going on i think that obama his election to the senate was divinely ordered i know that that was gods plan

9186994 most people have no idea they are wasting their time because theyve never been told the underlying principles of strength training
9186995 they expend energy and tire themselves out so they think their efforts are working so people perform hundreds of unnecessary workouts that have zero chance of transforming their bodies
9186996 ive never been a hard core bodybuilder those guys want to spend maximum time in the gym because thats their hobby but for me lifting weights is a means to get stronger so that i can use the strength doing something i enjoy outside of the gym and so i can get the health benefits of having more lean mass
9186997 i started researching ways i could significantly increase my strength in the least amount of time since i dont like spending lots of time in a gym
9186998 if you want to get strong the trump card is to lift a heavier weight for a very brief period rather than lift a lighter weight many times using multiple repetitions and several sets of repetitions as most people do static contraction training shows people how to lift the heaviest weight they can in only their strongest and safest range of motion but to hold the weight statically for only five seconds
9186999 so to train for the car lift my son did a 5 second leg press with the most weight he could hold then he took about a week off and came back and did another 5 second lift with a bit more weight thats how you know the previous workout was productive and you gave yourself adequate recovery time because only then do you see an increase in your strength after nine of those 5 second lifts he progressed to the point of being able to lift over 2 500 lbs on the leg press theres no magic to it and thats my point anyone can get this strong
9187000 the value of strength training is hugely underrated unfortunately many people have been conditioned to think of grotesque muscularity and rampant steroid use when they think about lifting weights thats a tragedy because strength along with aerobics and flexibility is one of the three measurements of overall fitness and speaking as a middle aged person muscularity is a key biomarker of aging so the more muscular a man or woman is the younger he or she is
9187001 its a well established medical fact that productive weightlifting delivers increased lean mass increased calorie burn at rest lower blood pressure and a half dozen other health benefits but most people are very busy and setting aside time for three 45 minute workouts every week is just not practical
9187002 i like to say the three biggest lies in strength training are monday wednesday and friday
9187003 the absolute key to making consistent progress is to give your body time to fully recover and to also add a bit of new muscle that takes time and the stronger you get the more you lift so you need more time to recover many people can train productively lifting weights only once per month
9187004 if my son or anyone else tried to leg press a car three times a week he would fail because full recovery and compensation takes longer than that so most people working out three times a week are just wasting their effort the truth is anyone can reach his or her desired strength and muscularity in 1 to 2 of the total training time they devote to conventional training methods and schedules so my training is ideal for busy people who want fitness results but dont want to make a hobby or a second job out of exercise almost everyone can afford time for 25 seconds of exercise once a month

9187010 jesse weighed 320 pounds and would have gained 50 to 75 additional pounds in the next six months and that would have affected his health a lot if they waited to get the procedure done in the usa they would have to go through a lengthy process of medical research that would have taken months or even years jesse couldnt afford to wait that long
9187011 they had tried all other means of weight loss including the atkins diet vegan diets weight watchers controlling portion sizes etc with only temporary success the few pounds that were lost were gained back in no time and this could be because jesse may have got the obesity gene from her
9187012 medical tourism corporation did a very good job in terms of facilitating the trip the communication was fast and clear there were no surprises special needs for the teen lap band surgery were handled very well
9187013 i am doing perfectly well it went better than i expected
9187014 the hospital in mexico had far better service better patient rooms and overall the hospital was nicer also jesse had far less pain than she had during her lap band experience in the u s
9187015 i want jesse to go from 320 pounds to 220 pounds in the next one year the weight loss surgery will help him get his self esteem back and will also allow him to be more involved in school activities
9187016 any kind of caloric restriction or reduction of food intake is going to make your body think that it is starving and that in turn will damage your metabolism even more

9187049 estos desaf os no son todos culpa del gobierno pero el no poder responder a ellos es un resultado directo de la pol tica disfuncional de washington y las pol ticas fallidas de george w bush estadounidenses somos mejores que lo que hemos visto estos ltimos ocho a os somos un mejor pa s que esto
9187050 john mccain ha votado junto a george bush el 90 de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar sobre el buen juicio pero qu se puede pensar sobre el buen juicio de alguien que consider que george bush ten a raz n m s del 90 de las veces
9187051 lo entiendo me doy cuenta de que no soy la persona con m s probabilidades de ocupar este cargo no concuerdo con el estereotipo y no he hecho carrera en washington pero hoy me encuentro ante ustedes porque algo est sucediendo en estados unidos lo que las personas que votaron en contra no entienden es que estas elecciones nunca se trataron de m siempre se ha tratado de ustedes
9187052 hace ocho a os algunas personas dijeron que no hab a mucha diferencia entre los candidatos de los dos grandes partidos pol ticos y que no importaba realmente cu l de los dos se convirtiera en presidente nuestro pa s ten a paz y prosperidad algunos dieron por hecho que seguir amos teniendo ambas cosas sin importar el resultado pero ahora estamos en el a o 2008 y dudo que alguien se atreva a decir que las elecciones no importaban cr anme cuando les digo que si el resultado hubiera sido otro no estar amos atascados en irak habr amos perseguido a bin laden hasta que lo captur ramos no estar amos sufriendo una crisis econ mica auto infligida estar amos luchando por las familias de clase media no estar amos violando la constituci n estar amos protegiendo los derechos de todos los estadounidenses independientemente de su raza religi n discapacidades sexo u orientaci n sexual y no estar amos negando la crisis del cambio clim tico la estar amos resolviendo
9187053 john mccain un hombre que se ha ganado nuestro respeto en muchos aspectos ahora est apoyando abiertamente las pol ticas de la casa blanca gobernada por bush y cheney y est prometiendo continuar con las mismas otra vez las mismas pol ticas yo creo en el reciclaje pero eso es rid culo con el apoyo de john mccain el presidente bush y el vicepresidente cheney sometieron a nuestra naci n a calamidad tras calamidad por su indiferencia ante los hechos por estar dispuestos a sacrificar las consecuencias a largo plazo por las repercusiones a corto plazo por someter el bienestar general al beneficio de unos pocos y por provocar un cortocircuito en el estado de derecho
9187054 planeamos llevarlos con nosotros no sabemos que nos deparar el mar hubo indicios de que israel podr a detenernos pero sabemos muy bien que los palestinos que vienen con nosotros tienen todos los papeles en regla tienen las visas necesarias y deber an permitirles viajar no hay motivo para que israel los tenga como rehenes los tenga prisioneros en gaza y les niegue asistencia m dica y el derecho a reunirse con su familia

9187096 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea

9187135 that service was horrible because that last hymn was too slow the kids were too loud the preacher said there were three points to his sermon and i heard seventeen that service wasnt good for me
9187136 that was a great service the preachers sermon struck a cord with me the choir did a good anthem and my prayer request was lifted up i was fed and i am filled
9187137 man i tanked that sermon i messed up that childrens moment that illustration worked just like i hoped or man it was nice to hear the chimes play today
9187138 so if youre serious about living this new resurrection life with christ act like it pursue the things over which christ presides dont shuffle along eyes to the ground absorbed with the things right in front of you look up and be alert to what is going on around where the action is see things from his perspective
9187139 and why is it necessary to be quiet in church
9187140 let the peace of christ keep you in tune with each other in step with each other none of this going off and doing your own thing and cultivate thankfulness let the word of christ the message have the run of the house give it plenty of room in your lives instruct and direct one another using good common sense and sing sing your hearts out to god let every detail in your lives words actions whatever be done in the name of the master jesus thanking god the father every step of the way

9187150 many investors believe october is the worst month for equity market returns this can be partly attributable to the fact some large one day declines have occurred in october
9187151 in actuality though the worst month for market returns is september although the average return in september is negative the magnitude of the decline was no worse than one to 1 5 percent
9187152 the economy is weaker than the gdp data might suggest and is not expected to repeat the growth of the first half
9187153 risks of another contraction in real gdp will remain elevated through the first half of 2009 as labor and housing markets search for their bottoms

9187168 i have changed the landscape of the christian church in the uk
9187169 this has become a social force in the new europe but one that is usually marginalised and misunderstood
9187170 the growth of churches like kicc is because of the continuing influx of west africans it becomes a place where they can feel at home and every facet of human life is catered for and we should look at it as a very positive force for society
9187171 this is a place where people can feel a sense of connectedness and they use the pastors as mentors who they can look to for direction
9187172 we have career counselling legal guidance and marriage help we are making ourselves relevant to the community

9187189 god is big very big much bigger than our narrow notions of how women should look if they are holy women god has big ideas for women
9187190 because both russia and norway have an interest in the development of the european oil and gas market
9187191 and we welcome them into the market because the market will be bigger if there are several suppliers
9187192 we are a reliable supplier and we have proved that over many years and we have a very transparent open energy sector
9187193 the situation is very interesting for norway of course we are looked upon as a stable nation whereas russia still has a tainted reputation in that respect so i think we will try to prove that we are a stable producer of oil and gas for europe
9187194 the ukraine issue sent a shiver down the european energy spine and georgia is a recent episode which will focus a lot of minds
9187195 i think we have to be how can i put it streetwise when it comes to issues around energy security norway is a great partner to have its a very sophisticated democracy with a great record when it comes to human rights so the new pipeline is a good piece of democratic politics
9187196 polemic theology how to deal with those who differ from us
9187197 we have communion with god in the doctrine we contend for
9187198 my counsel shall stand and i will accomplish all my purpose
9187199 all the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the lord and all the families of the nations shall worship before you for kingship belongs to the lord and he rules over the nations
9187200 of the same mind having the same love being in full accord and of one mind
9187201 behold how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity
9187202 so then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding
9187203 attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god
9187204 in the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
9187205 you will know the truth and the truth will set you free
9187206 love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment
9187207 he must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it
9187208 profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness
9187209 by the open statement of the truth we commend ourselves
9187210 but we have renounced disgraceful underhanded ways we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with gods word but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyones conscience in the sight of god
9187211 well then i think we are all agreed as to what a teacake is whats the next word jessop
9187212 its teach sir in our last edition we defined it as give systematic information to a person or about a subject or skill however we define a teacher as somebody who teaches especially in a school and as i was a teacher before i became a lexicographers assistant i cant help but notice that as a teacher i was never expected to give systematic information
9187213 were you not do teachers not do that these days
9187214 well some do sir but generally speaking its frowned upon children arent really meant to be informed anymore they should be finding things out for themselves and thinking about open ended questions the general feeling is that they shouldnt be bogged down with lots of useless knowledge that they could look up on the internet if they ever needed it
9187215 are they instructed in how to discover things for themselves could we say that teaching is systematic instruction
9187216 again im sure some teachers do instruct but it is frowned upon students dont really have to follow instructions any more they are meant to be self directed
9187217 if teachers arent meant to give information and arent able to make students find out information for themselves then what are they meant to do how are they meant to learn
9187218 but if a teacher cant tell them entertaining information or make them do entertaining things how is the teacher meant to entertain them
9187219 this is all very vague jessop they arent parenting the children they arent instructing them what sort of relationship is this
9187220 one based on personality i guess teachers are responsible for childrens emotional well being
9187221 happiness teachers should be cheering children up making them smile
9187222 oh i see humorous entertainment jessop so could we say that to teach is to be systematically entertaining in a humorous way
9187223 teachers arent really meant to be systematic anymore they are meant to fit their teaching to individual pupils instead of following a rigid style
9187224 could we say teaching is being humorously entertaining about a subject then
9187225 actually the last i heard was that teachers were meant to see themselves as teaching children not subjects traditional subjects are seen as artificial
9187226 i see so to teach is to humorously entertain children
9187227 it all seems very odd to me but i guess it will have to do whats the next word
9187228 so jessop can we say a teacher is a person employed to humorously entertain children
9187229 i think so hang on sir just one slight problem
9187230 we focus mostly on streaming the latest naruto and naruto shippuden episodes on the site we also provide our fans with onsite mp3 players through which we stream naruto mp3s users can also download these albums to their own mp3 players

9187232 i know there were some things written about me being injured i dont know where that came from because i wasnt injured
9187233 maybe my left ankle is not the greatest but i was more than fine to play how much i played was really a coachs decision
9187234 i had a game plan for myself but i guess it wasnt the same as the coachs plan my playing had nothing to do with my ankle it was just how the coach made the lineup
9187235 we just kind of sat back and laughed about it
9187236 for me that the lowest that my wife and i had gotten
9187237 we both were kind of like why why is this happening to us what did we do that was so wrong it felt like kind of big joke it crushed us
9187238 coach baldwin said hey you know when a defensive coordinator calls cover 1 man to man and expects you to cover that receiver one on one
9187239 i was like yes sir he said then thats what you have to do with god right now
9187240 its god and this heart right now one on one and i guarantee god will win as corny or as simple as it might seem that right there lifted me up
9187241 i was fortunate to be in mile high stadium last night to watch and listen to sen obamas historic speech as he accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states
9187242 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country he decided to strike a balance between rights and responsibilities and showed how we can have common sense gun laws in america to protect our families and communities
9187243 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
9187244 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over gun laws in america has moved to the middle ground now common sense gun laws that save lives and protect police can be debated on their merits
9187245 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night

9187255 when people move to mumbai for work and need a lunchbox carrier who do they ask

9187257 we get 10 to 15 enquiries more a day via sms and the website
9187258 the kit was attached to empty lunch boxes and delivered to about 100 000 clients homes
9187259 since our restaurant began serving lunch for office workers our business has increased by 60 per cent this increase in number of guests enjoying the new menu was the main reason for ben thanhs decision to introduce a buffet lunch

9187265 my family i think was among the earliest to endorse barack obama
9187266 im just one voter i was a hillary clinton democrat and i think people are going to have to make up their minds on what matters most to them
9187267 i had my friends from planned parenthood give me a bunch of condoms because i feel i need to protect myself from john mccain as a woman
9187268 who would you like to have in the white house at 3 a m if russia decides to invade another country no question its john mccain
9187269 drinking some kool aid that is not very relevant to this election
9187270 im not going to vote for obama im not going to vote for mccain either we love her hillary clinton but its our vote if we dont trust him or dont like him
9187271 those of us who have been clamoring for photo id for voting have been blocked by democrats who keep claiming such a requirement would disenfranchise the poor and the elderly it is time to call their bluff produce six people who dont have photo ids they dont exist they certainly dont try to buy alcohol fly take out a library book withdraw money from a bank rent a movie write a check at a grocery store rent a car take a cruise take metal in for recycling drive pick up tickets at will call buy cigarettes or get treated at the doctors office about all you can do without an id is breathe everyone has them ok you got me there may be some poor soul in a coma but theyre not supposed to vote
9187272 liz dont you think you might want to get to know your roommate a little before you put up a poster that might be you know
9187273 erm well its very arresting but the colors might be a little off putting besides it might not go with her stuff and she might care about that
9187274 without forgiveness life is governed by an endless cycle of resentment and retaliation
9187275 whereas each man claims his freedom as a matter of right the freedom he accords to other men is a matter of toleration
9187276 individuals having no religious affiliation show on the average less prejudice than do church members
9187277 opinions founded on prejudice are always sustained with the greatest violence

9187441 the book is written against the view that a philosophers biography is of no importance and that philosophy can be reduced to a series of systems of thought
9187442 so in a way its a revival of a rather ancient idea of philosophy being taught through examplary biography or the idea of philosophy as a way of life

9187488 this is long term project rate is 1 50 1000 entry we need teams that can do 24 7 captcha entry we are looking for individual teams to provide 10 000 to 200 000 entries per day per team we require 90 accuracy and avg entry time less than 10 seconds real time stats 3x a week pay via paypal only 1 50 1k or best bid outsourcing is allowed teams that can provide 24 hour service will be preferred dont west your and our time our captcha system is very complex and complicated it is built to process up to one million captchas per day we have several big teams and hundreds of active agents solving captchas all at one time especially during daytime in india the backend of this project involves over 45 powerful expensive servers communicating with the myspace site to pull the captchas and then queue them up on this site and then process the results to push back to myspace all within 20 seconds per captcha we run into many slowdowns the most common bottleneck is that myspace itself is often bogged down slow and error prone which then makes it very difficult for our servers to pull captchas quickly also much of the work on our servers is handled internationally so the internet connections have lag time usually when the server takes a long time to show a new captcha it is waiting for our other servers to pull another captcha sometimes 100 or more agents are waiting at the same time so the queue only goes to one agent at a time we recommend you try to work during afternoon and evening usa times night time in india we are constantly trying to improve the speed of our site we also continue to grow with expanding captcha teams and agents scaling our site is time consuming and expensive so implementation is not an immediate process

9187504 we are extremely outraged at governor palins decision to reinstate a wolf bounty to entice hunters to kill more wolves in the five control areas as reported in todays anchorage daily news
9187505 defenders continues to believe that the state does not have a sufficient scientific basis for implementing these programs

9187604 wrestlers like sushil kumar will win medals at the olympics but that would happen once in 50 years wrestling unfortunately is not a priority sport for the ioa though it has fetched india two olympic medals
9187605 you can make out how important the sport is for ioa as it did not think it fit to clear a masseur for sushil kumar you cannot think of winning a medal at the olympics without proper back up does anyone know or do they care that sushil is world number seven look at the way they treat players from elitist sports like tennis giving them anything they ask for
9187606 how many wrestlers were given the honour of carrying the countrys flag at the olympics or asian games opening ceremony i can name any number of wrestlers who missed out on medals just by a whisker but their feats have hardly been recognised and they remained unsung
9187607 because of the lack of awareness about the sport there is hardly any talent at the junior and cadet level sushil and yogeshwar dutt are top class wrestlers but more young men like them should be unearthed and motivated to take to wrestling there are any number of young wrestlers at the akhadas but they have to be spotted through talent hunt for all this there has to be a structure which is not there the akhadas should be encouraged and financed to work as nurseries
9187608 it is almost a week since the violence against christians started in orissa the central government has maintained an observer status and is allowing vishwa hindu parishad vhp activists to target poor people
9187609 vhp leader praveen togadia was allowed to take out a funeral procession of swami lakshmanand but we were stopped from entering the area
9187610 since many areas in orissa including kandhamal are under schedule 5 of the constitution areas and tribes needing special protection due to disadvantageous conditions the central government has an added responsibility
9187611 in spite of shoot at sight orders and curfew in several districts the violence against the christian community continues it shows the bharatiya janata party bjp which is in coalition with the biju janata dal in the orissa government is providing patronage to the carnage
9187612 thousands of people are homeless as their houses are burnt by vhp activists police have refused to register firs first information reports

9187681 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
9187682 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signalling processes but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
9187683 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signalling pathways the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
9187684 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
9187685 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases and justifies the current control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies

9187688 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
9187689 graeme smiths response would be different if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
9187690 everyone prospers when working together under a single shared technology vision
9187691 the french social model was appropriate for innovators and entrepreneurs to start working on alternative solutions to proprietary software fostering the creation of new projects in which a good mix of experienced professionals and skilled computer science students work together
9187692 oh my god this would totally make a good blog entry hah
9187693 im devastated i played in the 2005 victory and that felt great but this is devastating
9187694 we were still in it at half time and we had to dig deep for the final 15 minutes but we just couldnt hold on it was a massive effort from everyone
9187695 we gave ourselves a good chance at half time and we were confident that we could come back into it

9187704 rick is indeed a pioneer and a road safety leader in our community across ontario and the country he has greatly contributed to making our streets safer for everyone
9187705 i am pleased the ontario government has recognized the important role the centre for innovation will play in the future growth and development of our city and province and i thank them for their continued vision and support
9187706 this facility represents a solid investment in ottawas future labour force and will help drive economic development in our citys east end
9187707 i am confident that the city will join this growing partnership and make la cit coll giales expansion goals a reality
9187708 the centre for innovation is expected to bring as many as 1 400 students and 90 new jobs to orl ans and inject as much as 13 million into our local economy in its first five years but its benefits will truly be felt citywide
9187709 i begin to see how true it is that god shows no partiality rather that any person who fears god and does what is right is acceptable to god
9187710 no one who believes in god will be put to shame
9187711 everyone who calls on the name of the most high will be saved
9187712 i need to tell you this because i care about you but youre terribly arrogant and being arrogant is horribly unattractive and thats why youre single
9187713 expectations is the place you must always go to before you get to where youre going of course some people never go beyond expectations but my job is to hurry them along whether they like it or not
9187714 whether or not you find your own way youre bound to find some way
9187715 i would get high if i drank whisky for hours on the other hand i stay absolutely fine with champagne
9187716 by drinking this at least the only thing i would have to worry about the next morning is acidity not a hangover
9187717 i love cheesy flavours but not in a wine glass
9187718 from beginning to end this has been a very rough experience
9187719 there will be a lot of people who will benefit from this now and unfortunately in the future

9187721 u nless richt is holding that crystal football in miami at around 11 30 p m on jan 8 2009 this season will be a failure
9187722 our goals wont be measured in wins and losses this year we need to move forward and grow as a team
9187723 hell be running behind a shaky offensive line that looks as if its held together by duct tape purchased from one of arthur blanks old stores
9187724 its cool to say you were part of that team that was preseason no 1 but it would be a lot nicer to say it at the end of the season theres a lot of time between now and then
9187725 all night last night there was wind but not like now now its very strong things are starting to fall down
9187726 the wind was a little nerve wracking the howling but it turned out ok
9187727 perhaps the strangest claim repeated endlessly on the news channels is that she has proven she can cut taxes and reduce the size of government in alaska she may have cut taxes as mayor of wasilla but thats not the same as cutting taxes as governor of alaska where there is no state income tax or sales tax to cut
9187728 by contrast record oil prices since her election have helped palin avoid anything as sensitive as cutting off the longevity bonus or proposing a tire tax or wildlife viewing tax
9187729 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights

9187742 e la prima volta che accetto di girare un film non scritto da me ero molto impaurito dopo aver letto la sceneggiatura di petraglia e ancora di piu dopo aver letto il libro di melania mazzucco la violenza del romanzo in alcuni punti va ben oltre quello che poi abbiamo portato sullo schermo
9187743 lattrazione per questa storia nata da un fatto di cronaca mi ha al tempo stesso costretto a lasciarmi andare durante la lavorazione del film dice ancora il regista italo turco e rielaborare insieme a petraglia alcuni aspetti della sceneggiatura dagli ambienti alla reinvenzione di alcuni personaggi mantenendo comunque costante quellindelebile senso di violenza passione e tragedia nellintero corso del racconto
9187744 ho fatto questo film perche nessun altro attore ha accettato la parte rivela scherzosamente valerio mastandrea e ho provato ad estraniarmi dal contesto per non rischiare di essere risucchiato in maniera cosciente dalla natura del personaggio non credo lavrei mai interpretato se avessi avuto dei figli non ce lavrei fatta durante le riprese ferzan tentava di convincermi a non giudicare questuomo ma non potevo farne a meno alla fine pero rivedendo il film ho capito come pur affrontando il percorso su binari paralleli insieme al regista siamo arrivati alla stessa conclusione stavamo parlando della razza umana la cosa piu affascinante e terribile che si possa raccontare
9187745 ce sempre del pudore nel percorso individuale di unattrice nel cercare di interpretare situazioni al limite come questa
9187746 ero innamorata del romanzo speravo se ne facesse un film quando ho saputo che si era aperto il cast ho fatto una cosa che non mi era mai capitata prima ho mandato un sms a ferzan ozpetek che ovviamente non mi ha risposto
9187747 the fact that he took the flag and excelled racing in formula one he was kind of a hero for all of us in the united states during that period
9187748 he had great talent i got to know phil when his son derek and my son were racing in atlantics and he was very dedicated to motorsports and just a great guy
9187749 the cars were a lot different than today but the idea is the same to get in the car and make it go as fast as you can accept the challenges and go racing
9187750 as a result ive switched to compiling my debug builds using the md switch if you do this you also have to undefine the debug preprocessor macro otherwise you get lots of errors about crtdebugreportw not found this function is apparently inserted into your code if debug is defined but is only defined in the debug crt as long as optimization is off it seems to be perfectly possible to debug programs compiled this way and there are no concerns about crt incompatibility

9187756 i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
9187757 my father just literally died in my arms i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral
9187758 this will show her true colors thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
9187759 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9187760 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9187761 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9187762 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet

9187765 while the housing market is continuing to experience difficulty the decline in home sales has leveled off recently and sales are rising in some parts of the country

9187788 in todays world the internet is one of the first places people go for information
9187789 we launched this new web site because we want to make it even easier for our patients to learn about the various facial rejuvenation procedures we offer the site places special emphasis on the mini face lift because our denver patients have begun to express a growing interest in the procedure but it contains key information on a number of other facial procedures as well
9187790 men and women who are considering cosmetic surgery want to be able to do research on their own in the privacy of their own homes before they come to talk with a surgeon
9187791 we developed the step by step surgery guide in order to give patients a very real detailed explanation of what their procedure will be like
9187792 hearing from real patients has a very strong influence on people who are considering plastic surgery
9187793 they want a firsthand perspective about what the procedure was like i hope that our patients find the stories we post to the site helpful and informative
9187794 we felt in order to take our growing practice to the next level our site needed to be revamped
9187795 as a practice that understands the full spectrum of womens unique health care needs we also understand that todays patient is relying more on the web as a source of information so our redesigned site provides new and existing patients a resource that will help them in preparing for their visit
9187796 raco has invested in the resources that intermec requires in order to be selected to participate in this elite program
9187797 we are very excited to enhance our relationship with intermec and expand our services to the customers that enjoy their outstanding line of printers it will also enhance our existing range of intermec products and services that will offer the customer a completely integrated data collection solution
9187798 we are pleased to recognize and certify our valued partners who are fully committed to the printer market and maintain the highest level of technical adeptness regarding our printer solutions

9187801 there is a list of superlative accomplishments thus far with the club track nationals leading the way with our road running teams open masters and seniors all having a legitimate shot at winning the nyrrc team titles there are reasons to be optimistic in addition to the outstanding team success thus far there are a number of individual accomplishments that should be highlighted such as carl dambkowskis 15k win in central park followed by his sparkling 19 36 four mile race val barnwells 60 meter indoor record 50 victory at world championships and aileen conlons number one ranked four mile road time in the usa
9187802 the key to our teams overall success is having one track workout for vo2 maximum development and one solid tempo workout these are basic guidelines but we stay true to form we want to make sure that our athletes run at a more anaerobic level while working out on the track and build strength in the early part of the season eventually we shift focus to running two track workouts one consisting of longer intervals while the other consists of building on raw speed it should also be noted that our sprinters have a completely different program as you can see based on our club track nationals we have a great range of diversity
9187803 the mens team has never won an open division title so that would be extremely exciting while our womens team is also looking to become three time champions overall we want to finish the season strong and perform well in the nyc marathon

9187817 by making covering kids a priority we have been able to get 84 000 children health care coverage we still have a ways to go because there are approximately 75 000 children in the state uninsured despite the legislatures efforts to raise income eligibility limits and open up programs to the families that need them
9187818 apple health for kids will help us reach out to those families and help them get coverage for their children
9187819 to try to erase many years of thinking about either needing to change their sound or evolve

9187821 i said to them lets say there was a battle of the bands coming up and nobody knew who they were and they cant rely on any of their hits to get them over what would that sound like
9187822 it cant sound like those songs because you already have those songs
9187823 the exercise wasnt to rewrite songs like that but to write songs in that spirit
9187824 you cant make yourself a virgin again but i got what rubin meant
9187825 yeah i would say that was a different person i know more now but on this record i needed to take the reins again and get heavy and scary with myself again i dont have to be afraid of the anger i think its a lot easier to access now i know how far i want to go with it and ive gone far and still been o k ive had duality my whole life theres the person i hide and the person i show im the entertainer out there im the master of the stage when thats done i get to go sit by myself so i am both is that the one i want to be is this the one i want to be probably neither but living in the middle just seems too blah

9187840 so the governor and the mayor and the parish called for evacuations
9187841 were asking people to pay close attention to that when called to evacuate please evacuate
9187842 what youre seeing is a total culture change in not only how this organization is going to respond but how the states and local communities are going to respond
9187843 if people living there are asked to evacuate they should not depend on the levees

9187849 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9187850 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9187851 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9187852 senator mccain had so many other options if he wanted to put a women on his ticket such as senator kay bailey hutchison or senator olympia snowe they would have been an appropriate choice compared to this dangerous choice

9187861 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
9187862 everybody needs to work like everybody else and prove he deserves to play
9187863 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
9187864 i was never treated like a prince as you know i even had some problems here at milan but i overcame them through hard work and sacrifices
9187865 right now im happy to have returned home the most important thing for me to is get playing again i want that so badly

9187876 we are always pretty conservative in our estimates and we were predicting we would be down approximately 150 students from june to september
9187877 what that means is there are fewer five year old students in the central okanagan versus graduating grade 12s
9187878 its going to be real interesting by the end of the first week of september because weve got schools that are reporting significant numbers of new families to the area its not the family that moves from lakeview heights to the mission its families coming in from alberta ontario even overseas

9187897 que los mexicanos hemos sufrido la usurpaci n del gobierno de la rep blica pero es manifiesta la decisi n mayoritaria del pueblo por dotarse de un gobierno leg timo encabezado por el ciudadano que gan la elecci n presidencial de 2006 andr s manuel l pez obrador y el pueblo que acude a la plaza de la constituci n coraz n de la rep blica merece un grito de independencia cuya alocuci n sea dada por una persona con autoridad moral incuestionable como lo es el presidente leg timo de m xico para honrar a los h roes que iniciaron la lucha por patria y libertad
9187898 congress is already investigating allegations of manipulation in the oil market and it seems likely that it is only a matter of time before a similar investigation will be required in the precious metal markets
9187899 the data in the bank participation report is so clear and compelling that it is hard to conclude anything but manipulation
9187900 one can take any data and make it suit their argument
9187901 the theory that the market is somehow sinisterly manipulated especially as it comes at a time when u s regulators are keeping a keen eye on the goings on in the commodities and financial markets for just such type of evidence is simply ludicrous and totally out of touch with market reality
9187902 my gut feeling is that the republicans wouldnt mind taking oil back down under 100 before the elections
9187903 there is a lot of nervousness especially in energy pits about the efforts under way to propose wrong footed legislation from politicians who want to bring down the price of gasoline
9187904 i dont believe we have a speculative bubble but these moves are going to drive a lot of hot money out of commodities pits between now and the elections
9187905 there is indeed a rational explanation for the decline in the price of gold and silver the dollar has staged one huge rally and fundamentals suggested the dollar should rally
9187906 stand to buy or sell the commodities taking the other side from other people or institutions entering a market
9187907 because investors particularly short term technically oriented funds were selling
9187908 what you have here is the footprints of hedge funds exiting the commodities markets en masse
9187909 they make the markets and take what is coming at them
9187910 each group met the facilitator separately and the import of those meetings was for president mbeki to gauge feelings and thereafter decide on a way forward
9187911 it is understood mangoma brought back issues that had been discussed and disposed of way in the past
9187912 the only new but nonetheless absurd suggestion from the mdc t was that cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai zanu pf dismissed that not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9187913 zanu pf was very categorical that it was not prepared to indulge the mdc t with such useless suggestions it said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc t to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9187914 the mdc t is conveniently forgetting that it not only endorsed the opening of the parliament through its participation but actually gained speakership as a result of the process are they ready to let go the speakership

9187917 get a new grasp of the holy spirit by listening to this conversation in a pub
9187918 remember last summer when i asked you what all this darkness was for
9187919 yes its flattering but all wedding dresses are made to be flattering
9187920 i am perhaps it is a hope bred in young girls read too many fairy tales i dont know
9187921 maybe its not going to happen maybe there wont be one that stands out above the rest maybe i will just have to pick from the ones that ive already tried on
9187922 well it took me 30 years to commit to a man one week for a dress is sudden in comparison
9187923 maybe other people have been right all this time and my expectations
9187924 if you could have your very favorite why would you ever choose your second favorite
9187925 i am so quick to moan about what i dont have or what seems unfair in my life when the reality is that the lord has dealt bountifully with me
9187926 la mente abierta en torno a lo que se pueda o no encontrar
9187927 everything has happened very quickly so i could not even say goodbye to my team mates
9187928 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no

9187935 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9187936 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
9187937 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
9187938 trig is beautiful and already adored by us we knew through early testing he would face special challenges and we feel privileged that god would entrust us with this gift and allow us unspeakable joy as he entered our lives we have faith that every baby is created for good purpose and has potential to make this world a better place we are truly blessed
9187939 was ihr heute hier vorhabt ist einzuordnen in unser gesamtprojekt wenn unser projekt hier gelingt hat das auswirkungen auf l nder ber deutschland hinaus
9187940 ich m chte dass auch hessen auf die rote landkarte kommt
9187941 is in a lot of physical and emotional stress lately
9187942 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9187943 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9187944 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9187945 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9187946 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9187947 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9187948 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9187949 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9187950 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9187951 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9187952 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9187953 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9187954 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9187955 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9187956 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9187957 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9187958 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9187959 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9187960 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9187961 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9187962 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9187963 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9187964 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9187965 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9187966 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9187967 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9187968 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9187969 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9187970 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9187971 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9187972 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9187973 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9187974 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9187975 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9187976 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9187977 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9187978 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9187979 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9187980 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9187981 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9187982 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9187983 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9187984 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9187985 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9187986 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9187987 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9187988 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9187989 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9187990 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9187991 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9187992 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9187993 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9187994 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9187995 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9187996 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9187997 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9187998 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9187999 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9188000 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9188001 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9188002 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9188003 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9188004 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9188005 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9188006 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9188007 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9188008 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9188009 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9188010 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9188011 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9188012 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9188013 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9188014 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9188015 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9188016 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9188017 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9188018 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9188019 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9188020 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9188021 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9188022 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9188023 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9188024 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9188025 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9188026 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9188027 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

9188035 exclusive contracts have been one of the most significant barriers to competition cable prices have risen about 93 percent in the last 10 years this is a way to introduce additional competition which will result in lower prices and greater innovation
9188036 in a place where there are trees mountains and running water all of which he quite appreciates
9188037 one skilled in the science of joining together in an orderly fashion the knowledge of one field of learning with that of other fields
9188038 although i have read the ny times almost daily since junior high school it wasnt until my politics matured that i realized its function as the establishments official line of right thinking
9188039 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9188040 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9188041 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go

9188048 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9188049 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9188050 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january

9188053 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9188054 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9188055 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9188056 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9188057 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9188058 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9188059 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9188060 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

9188062 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9188063 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9188064 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9188065 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

9188104 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
9188105 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane

9188128 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9188129 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9188130 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9188131 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9188132 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states

9188203 there must be better ways to prime the states tourism pump
9188204 while south carolina state officials are scrambling to find enough money to offset declining revenues for essential state services the states competitive grants program has allocated 100 000 to pay for 120 german politicians to visit myrtle beach
9188205 this bill has had a major impact on the transient boaters passing through the state who often stay for extended periods particularly during the winter boating season as northerners head south during the fall and then back north during the spring
9188206 northern boaters heading south this winter should be advised to keep the situation in mind
9188207 since they shortened the time boaters have either been bypassing south carolina or staying for a short time and having service work done in north carolina and georgia instead of here
9188208 these rallies are viewed by the residents as a public nuisance and a destruction of the quality of life for the residents who live and work in the city of myrtle beach

9188232 the hydrogen train is a european consortium aiming at developing amp launching europes first hydrogen powered train by year 2010 the driver for this vision is the many societal amp business opportunities amp potentials that sustainable hydrogen rail in europe holds
9188233 as for the hydrogen commuter cars bombardier is continuing to work on this project when the premier was at the plant in september he spoke about the potential for building hydrgen cars at bombardier but it was always clear that much work needed to be done before this could occur we continue to support bombardier in their constant goal of creating state of the art commuter cars but as i said earlier this is still at an early stage certainly not a stage that would be part of this years budget

9188245 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief that s a debate i m ready to have
9188246 t he records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time

9188312 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9188313 sobre la ocupaci n de territorio georgiano por parte de rusia
9188314 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9188315 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9188316 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9188317 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9188318 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9188319 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country
9188320 we look forward to a better day even as we prepare for a threat to come
9188321 its too early to know exactly what kind of impact no two storms are alike but theres got to be concern anywhere in louisiana perhaps even as far west as extreme east texas and as far east as the florida panhandle
9188322 im hoping the preparations and actions taken will be more orderly and save more lives than we have in the past
9188323 cuba is the grand target for today id say the western half of cuba will experience impacts from the storm
9188324 to save lives protect property and public health and safety or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
9188325 gloria wanted to speak but shes not lets give her a round of applause anyway
9188326 gloria wanted to speak but shes not lets give her a round of applause anyway
9188327 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9188328 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9188329 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9188330 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9188331 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9188332 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work
9188333 as hillary clinton aptly stated senator mccain has a lifetime of experience
9188334 he will use that experience as president to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses grow the economy and reduce our nations independence on foreign oil

9188337 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
9188338 everybody needs to work like everybody else and prove he deserves to play
9188339 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
9188340 i was never treated like a prince as you know i even had some problems here at milan but i overcame them through hard work and sacrifices
9188341 right now im happy to have returned home the most important thing for me to is get playing again i want that so badly
9188342 i know it will be difficult but ive chosen with my heart
9188343 with respect to the other teams i cant see myself playing with any other jersey in italy

9188345 there is not a single report of an animal being trained to tap peck or move in synchrony with an auditory beat
9188346 but when the crowd became excited and began a rhythmic roaring and stamping the young man could resist no longer and joined in as orgiastically as everyone else
9188347 we were at the birdland jazz club one night and buddy rich was playing opposite us he played so fast between the two cymbals it was like a blur he brought the house down everybody started howling and clapping so art blakey thought what am i going to do so he took a big breath and started playing everything at one time the bass drum the snare drum the cymbals and the stage felt like it was going to collapse and the people went wild the excitement those two guys created oh man
9188348 research has now shown that so called responses to rhythm actually precede the external beat we anticipate the beat we get rhythmic patterns as soon as we hear them and we establish internal models or templates of them
9188349 while i was working on my book or my painting or whatever you want to call it
9188350 porca miseria non so se sia abituato a dirlo ma ci sta bene si ritorna a campionati normali
9188351 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9188352 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9188353 i dont know if you showed the cake there that they had there three years ago today with mccain and bush when marie antoinette when she said let them eat cake i think she was speaking figuratively they literally were while new orleans was drowning eating cake so its um i dont know lets hope things get better
9188354 the cause for the search warrant is not public at this time
9188355 the convergence center is simply a gathering place and is not used for illegal actions it is a place for workshops and trainings
9188356 we are now accused of a simple fire code violation
9188357 just a space to get food free internet community organization
9188358 this is the time for the department heads to let me know if they plan to move forward or if its time for a change
9188359 it was the barracuda in her that came out that those guys were on the side of former mayor john stein and im going to get rid of them
9188360 i went through a lot with the press with the legislative body and it was rough with a staff who didnt want to be there working with a new boss
9188361 trying to bury the cuts and closings under all the obama coverage
9188362 he wanted to watch it at home with his family
9188363 theyll be minor things but things could pick up in the next day or two

9188374 fui siguiendo con el nimo de seguir colaborando pero al irse sergio marconccini pens que no tenia nada que hacer all y presentamos la renuncia tanto el presidente como el vicepresidente miguel fonte

9188376 the peeing for me was instant because i needed one but the whole process with the paperwork was probably 15 minutes

9188380 were not on the wada world anti doping agency list our list is pretty fair if they banned caffeine id be in trouble but thats about it
9188381 its so hard to play for this team in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world and we have standards
9188382 they may be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9188383 the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team
9188384 in my opinion and the rest of the leadership groups opinion you need to be committed 100 per cent to all facets of being an international cricketer
9188385 he wasnt organised enough to understand his commitments that day
9188386 that to me raises concerns about how and what sort of space he is in in his own mind and thats the discussion we had with him
9188387 i was fortunate to get those few waves out at the beginning that allowed me to get a few manoeuvres in
9188388 it was really tough out there really fast and racy and not easy to get scores
9188389 unfortunately for layne she wasnt able to find a wave she could really open up on
9188390 its my second year on tour and im looking to defend my title
9188391 im just happy that i can still hang with the young girls to finish in the final and move up to third is a great place to be heading into the back half of the season
9188392 im really proud of steph shes been the form surfer all event and she deserved the win
9188393 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9188394 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9188395 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9188396 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and
9188397 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9188398 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9188399 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9188400 we saw mark play against sydney in the pre season cup and he was exceptional
9188401 at the moment he needs the fans to be behind him
9188402 he is always under pressure to score goals but we want him to feel relaxed and play football like he loves it
9188403 makes it clear that such pain and suffering is at the extreme end of the spectrum of acts by reserving criminal penalties solely for torture

9188422 we danced like new years eve we danced from sheer relief
9188423 for the most part were not one of those bands who inspire indifference in people
9188424 usually we are a bit of a flashpoint for opinionated people we get both praise and love from various sides of the spectrum and we also get a lot of vitriol

9188468 the cost of oblivious daydreaming was always this moment of return the realignment with what had been before and now seemed a little worse her reverie once rich in plausible details had become a passing silliness before the hard mass of the actual briony had lost her godly power of creation but it was only at this moment of return that the loss became evident part of a daydreams enticement was the illusion that she was helpless before its logic
9188469 he kissed her lightly at first but they drew closer and when their tongues touched a disembodied part of himself was abjectly grateful for he knew he now had a memory in the bank and would be drawing on it for months to come he was drawing on it now in a french barn in the small hours

9188503 for me nothing has changed i have always had a contract for 2009
9188504 i feel bad to see a great champion like him not among the top 10 at valencia but as for ferarri he can relax
9188505 no one should forget who is the world champion after he raikkonen did what not many predicted triumph in his first year 2007 with ferrari
9188506 kimi is motivated and we must work hard to help him qualify higher especially on all these new circuits that i do not like and that are bad for f1 you cannot overtake and nine times out of 10 the winner is he who gets pole

9188550 strong physical specimen who is lusted after by so many men and women
9188551 the one thing i dont like is guys acting girly
9188552 i dont like gay marriage being pushed as a political agenda its extremely unpopular amongst the wider african american community as an african american i dont like being pressured to sign up to any agenda by a gay rights movement that has always been predominantly white and has historically shown next to no interest in the rights of its fellow black gay men and women and for myself i feel that there are more important issues that need sorting out first the seemingly deep rooted inability of gay men particularly black gay men to commit to each other for instance when i was a dancer i was struck by how often couples would watch me perform i would be up there at the uptown downtown or wherever dancing putting on a show and enjoying myself these guys would give me and the other dancers tips and that was nice of course and there was to my mind nothing wrong with them showing their appreciation of my physique and my performance but then one half of the couple would sneak back to the club the following night or the following week and try to pick me up try to get me to have sex with him behind his mates back i would always remember them from the previous night or the previous week and say but arent you in a relationship yes but he doesnt understand me was the standard reply he cant give me what i need so there they were coming on to me now im not saying heterosexual couples are without their troubles lord knows but it seems to me that the less overtly political issue of male couples being able to establish loving faithful relationships between each other through commitment and communication is more important than that of gay marriage maybe im a cynic when it comes to marriage anyway marriage is only an outward symbol after all the papers the marriage certificate the lavish wedding ceremony the exchange of rings weighed down with so many carats all these are just outward symbols theyre supposed to be saying i love this person the ring is supposed to declare that i want to be with this person through the ups and downs good times and bad i dont care how many rings you put on your finger i dont care how many times you stand up and declare you want to be with this person for a lifetime it means nothing the fact of the matter is that even with all these extravagant symbols divorce rates among straight couples are at an all time sky high why would i imagine that being able to marry would help me sustain my loving partnership in any way but whatever the arguments my personal bottom line is im not going to stand before the god of abraham issac and jacob and tell him i want to marry another man im just not going to do it and thats just about me and what im comfortable with im not ashamed of being bisexual i dont believe its wrong for me to desire and love another man but i also dont believe its necessary for me to marry a man to express that desire and love for him and i will not be co opted into supporting agendas pushed forward by groups who dont support me
9188553 a gay rights movement that has historically shown next to no interest in the rights of its fellow black gay men and women
9188554 see even men who identify as gay dont think they should be able to get married
9188555 fuck him for feeling the need to speak this backwards shit publicly
9188556 yet thats his right he has a right to say whatever he feels and if its done publicly thats his right too
9188557 im not going to stand before the god of abraham issac and jacob and tell him i want to marry another man
9188558 i put in some faux high brow sounding almost discourse about the lgbt community traditionally ignoring racial and ethnic minorities but thats just there to make me sound like i might even have a dog in this fight because what i really mean is that god doesnt want me to marry another man and therefore none of us should be discussing the rights of same sex couples to marry
9188559 there is only one god mine and we shouldnt piss him off and your behavior pisses him off so stop it
9188560 i feel that there are more important issues that need sorting out first the seemingly deep rooted inability of gay men particularly black gay men to commit to each other for instance
9188561 maybe the question isnt what the gay community can do blacks but what blacks can teach the gay community weve been down this road before yes we have

9188587 why one writes is a question i can easily answer having so often asked it myself i believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live i could not live in any of the worlds offered to me the world of my parents the world of war the world of politics i had to create a world of my own like a climate a country an atmosphere where i could breathe reign and recreate myself when destroyed by living that i believe is reason of every work of art we also write to heighten our awareness of life we write to lure enchant and to console others we write to serenade we write to taste life twice once in the moment and once in retrospection we write to be able to transcend our life to reach beyond it we write to teach ourselves to speak to others to record the journey into the labyrinth we write to expand our world when we feel strangled or restricted or lonely if you do not breathe through writing if you do not cry out in writing or sing in writing then dont write because our culture has no use for it

9188616 gugatan akan sistem politik demokrasi akan selalu muncul ketika hak ekonomi sosial dan budaya tidak terpenuhi sementara yang mengedepan hanya hak sipil dan politik sistem politik demokrasi akan selalu memunculkan gugatan saat rakyat tetap melarat pengangguran tetap membengkak rakyat tak memiliki daya beli dan rakyat tak merasakan kehadiran negara ketika berada dalam kesulitan

9188728 se o trabalhador d um donativo por sua iniciativa porque que o sindicato lhe pede que assine um papel onde se compromete a faz lo

9188738 ive been on the other end of that ive been 40 games out before so i know what that feels like
9188739 overall i felt good throughout the night even at the end i felt strong and its all you can ask for
9188740 i tried to work quick and keep a good tempo throughout the game
9188741 i was really focused on hitting my spots nobody wants to start 1 and 0 2 and 0 to guys i made a conscious effort tonight to throw a strike and strike two also it is good to pitch well and win
9188742 any time the offense gets shut down like that its not going to look good
9188743 its over so throw it away and come back ready because we can still take two of three
9188744 if you think about it its just in passing like oh thatd be nice to hit one one of these days
9188745 im sure if you play long enough youre going to
9188746 its running out quick but the only thing i can say is look at the team i was on last year the phillies we were down seven with 17 to go dont count on a hail mary like that every year but it shows that it can be done
9188747 if i can maintain that it gives me a chance to succeed
9188748 well sit on this one for about 30 minutes and come out and do it again tomorrow
9188749 it seems like im having a little more fun in cleveland
9188750 im able to relax better it feels like the pressures off
9188751 it would make sense if it happened once in a while for a year maybe but it doesnt make any sense that it happens year after year
9188752 good thing im mentally strong or i might just quit or something
9188753 you play so many games they all run together i go out and prepare the same way every day
9188754 youre only as good as your next days pitcher thats just the way it works
9188755 not enough production not enough two out hits thats a big part of it
9188756 just the fact that we saw more pitches and scored more pitches up made a big difference with a pitcher like kenny
9188757 i was able to kind of calm down a little bit and keep us there make some pitches so they didnt get anything too out of hand
9188758 were playing good because we feel very confident at home and everybody is healthy
9188759 you have to have that feeling of how to pitch
9188760 that lifts our confidence weve been fighting through some things
9188761 i hope we can get this momentum and keep going
9188762 its nice to be on this side of a game like this
9188763 i was happy about the way i was attacking the strike zone and pitching to contact
9188764 before i was a guy who wanted to light up the ks but now im a guy who really just tries to let the defense do their job
9188765 all these remaining games were doing what we have to do
9188766 it was like i never pitched before im disgusted with my outing
9188767 i feel strong i feel good my sinker was very good and the guys playing behind me played very good
9188768 we have played good the last four games were enjoying it right now
9188769 its a lot more fun around here when youre winning and were going to try to finish up strongly
9188770 the way both teams were playing the first ones real big for us
9188771 weve still got two more games in the series we need to get at least one more of these
9188772 we need to find a way to get this stuff straightened out
9188773 theres still plenty of time left right now the last couple of weeks have been ugly
9188774 my split got better as the game went on and i was able to strike out people
9188775 the only thing i can do is go out there and pitch
9188776 ive got to just worry about that go out there throw scoreless innings keep the game close whatever i can do
9188777 every game right now is of equal importance and significance
9188778 i think ive had a lot more movement on my pitches and ive been able to stay out of big innings
9188779 thats why i wanted to help him so bad to win that game
9188780 weve been playing good baseball it seems like for the better part of three months its frustrating we didnt play better the first two months
9188781 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9188782 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9188783 i am deeply offended by the lpgas decision to contemplate such a discriminatory policy
9188784 not only is this punishment severe and unfair to the worlds most renowned lpga professionals this policy goes contrary to the democratic values i and many californians hold dear with respect to diversity and equality
9188785 for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
9188786 completing the gold line extension to montclair just makes sense
9188787 the gold line has recently seen the largest jump in ridership among all the local lines
9188788 we will respond with teams on the ground when its safe and the affected states give us permission
9188789 often following their lead when they are more qualified or better equipped
9188790 from what i have heard minker was a great person who did a lot for the city of wilmington and the blue rocks
9188791 its a great award and im honored to be the first winner but getting involved in the community is not about winning an award you should just do it to help other people
9188792 whenever i approached everett about an appearance his only question was what time do you need me
9188793 it was a pleasure to see the genuine interest he took in all the young fans

9188847 mr camberton who appears to be devoid of any narrative gift makes this an excuse for dragging in disconnectedly and to little apparent purpose a series of thinly disguised local or literary celebrities
9188848 that he found time to write at all puzzled the little crowd of habitu s which watched him and heard him every evening with respectful animosity at his corner of the bar

9188863 he was with a very attractive woman i think he must have been knocking about with her for quite a long time she was very gentile very county enormously devoted to him in a distant kind of way she didnt like being associated with soho or drink
9188864 shes got lots of money she wants to get married shes got a house with hunting and that kind of thing i go down there my family have cut me off they dont want to see me i cant go on i dont really have anything to do
9188865 he lost touch completely with the family their relationship was quietly wrapped up as it were placed in the cupboard of limbo and locked away
9188866 good god i can find 20 people to write picaresque novels about hackney i want someone who writes dull as ditchwater technical material
9188867 henrys departure hes a marvellous writer but it takes him weeks to polish a paragraph
9188868 a man who didnt have any interest in making money periton probably got him the job at mgm to keep him afloat nobody knows if henry ever wrote anything else under another name my view is at the times i ran into him he was a declining person he had problems with his inamorata
9188869 accumulated memories do work their way to the surface i have a notion henry married his lady they had a child it could be a whole new chapter in henrys story
9188870 i was born in december 1954 my mothers name was lilian joyce brown she was from andover in hampshire she lived in london during the war working as a silver service waitress at the savoy she was three years younger than my father she died 20 years ago at the age of 64 she was a bit reclusive towards the end of her life and fairly secretive too
9188871 mum liked jewish men it was a bit rebellious at the time my father pursued her and chatted her up mum told me in her rather prim way that he was very virile
9188872 my father made the name up by combining camberwell and brixton he hated them both he hated coming south of the river he was very proud of the fact that he lived in chelsea
9188873 it was all hollywood then everything was a story a romance when mum decided to call herself camberton my father slid away he ended the association
9188874 my father produced a huge stack of legal papers and presented them to my mother isnt that dramatic i was in the pram that was their final parting the end of the relationship there was no further point of contact
9188875 shes three months pregnant and she kills herself the whole theme is right there a woman who is not of his class not in his league and having a child thats probably why he didnt want my mother to read it
9188876 ginsberg was very much aware of her desirable presence by his side so delightful were her little moues and winks that he felt like whispering into her ear an invitation
9188877 until lolita became his mistress ginsberg was delighted with the novelty of this courtship but afterwards there was nothing to sustain their relations except recrudescent desire ginsberg was also still ashamed of lolitas background which though it might supply colour for an adventure an anecdote made a long term affair impossible at the same time he was ashamed of being ashamed
9188878 the kind of individual who finds it pleasant to vegetate
9188879 london history is his special subject and he writes with erudition and clarity in small reviews
9188880 my intention is to make two journeys one partly on foot through europe and the second to north america
9188881 a man in a mackintosh dignified anonymous alone he is isolated from other writers from the jewish community and his essential anonymity implies almost an element of choice
9188882 the lines are being more clearly drawn on the gun issue
9188883 one day after senator obama made it clear that he thinks assault weapons should be banned in a remarkable portion of his speech here senator mccain selects someone who is not only proud to be endorsed by the nra an opponent of that ban but apparently is pretty enthusiastic about the guns themselves

9188893 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9188894 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9188895 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9188896 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and
9188897 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights

9188932 another interesting source of investment information is newsletters that you can buy for a few hundred dollars per year the investment results of some of these newsletters look impressive and they should in 1985 the u s supreme court ruled that newsletters were exempt from the investment advisors act of 1940 and therefore not subject to sec regulation that means courts view newsletters as journalistic works and as a result newsletters can claim they have achieved any performance number they wish even if it is not true and their claim is protected under the first amendment

9188955 you know governor palin has more executive experience than senator obama senator biden and senator schumer combined because those guys have never run anything
9188956 there were several women spoken about as possible vice presidential candidates kay bailey hutchinson from texas meg whitman from ebay carly fiorina why governor palin
9188957 shes a chief executive of a state shes a governor former mayor of a city in alaska shes been a businesswoman she helped her husband run the family fishing business shes a mom of five and shes a reformer shes not a washington insider shes been a reformist governor and very strongly supported in alaska
9188958 you know governor palin has more executive experience than senator obama senator biden and senator schumer combined because those guys have never run anything so i find that quite amusing
9188959 i was very disappointed with senator obamas choice of a running mate he chose somebody else whos a washington insider from the east coast who knows nothing about the west and senator mccain surely does im also very pleased that hes chosen as his vice president the chief executive of the oil producing state in america strong energy credentials and the energy issue is very important to americans

9189036 ik hoor verschillende mensen zeggen dat we dicht bij een akkoord zijn dat klopt niet er komt geen akkoord als het resultaat ons niet volledig bevalt en daarvoor moet er gepraat worden over economische immigratie
9189037 in afwachting is het fout om te zeggen dat het dossier niet beheerd wordt er bestaat een wetgeving die wordt toegepast en elke dag zijn er regularisaties afwijzingen en uitwijzingen
9189038 de kwestie is niet te weten of we iemand regulariseren die in een kraan kruipt of wiens advocaat elke dag met de media praat het echte debat dat we nu moeten voeren is dat over de economische immigratie gaan we onze grenzen dicht houden voor bepaalde europeanen en willen we dat de polen verplicht worden om door te gaan bij ons clandestien te werken of gaan we hen eindelijk officieel toelaten waarom zetten we onze grenzen niet open voor knelpuntberoepen en waarom kunnen we de mensen die al in ons land zijn en in die sectoren werken niet laten blijven

9189071 for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man but men spoke from god as they were carried along moved by the holy spirit
9189072 if anyone adds anything to them god will add to him the plagues described in this book and if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life
9189073 the bible must be the invention either of good men or angels bad men or devils or of god however it was not written by good men because good men would not tell lies by saying thus saith the lord it was not written by bad men because they would not write about doing good duty while condemning sin and themselves to hell thus it must be written by divine inspiration

9189075 it was wonderful that so much hard work was put in at the four day rehearsals the challenge was to get the audience to focus on the music
9189076 i am glad to be here the audience evidently was impressed by our musical style and hard work
9189077 it expressed emotions that the audience felt and many had responded with a smile during that performance it is a rare experience to receive the coaching that we have had

9189084 recognising this need muet marks the importance of the english language as an international language in this borderless world
9189085 these two books are timely as students need both guidance and practice to sit for this test even more so with the implementation of the new test specifications
9189086 the books are intended for classroom use as well as for self study the writing section covers a spectrum of topics that encourages students to be interested in contemporary issues
9189087 the speaking section prepares students effectively whether individually or in groups
9189088 the listening section is professionally done as the scripts are recorded by both malaysian and native speakers this helps students to respond appropriately to what they hear

9189099 the development and asset management division of unimas has to play a more effective role in supervising the project management consultants and engineering consultants responsible for the project as they are paid a high fee amounting to rm55 81 million
9189100 the engineering consultants were of the opinion that the automatic fire detection system and manual electric alarm were unnecessary
9189101 further discussions with the sarawak fire department were held a few times based on the discussions held on june 25 the fire department will consider this matter after receiving the full report from the engineering consultant
9189102 the bank did not conduct proper investigations over the financial standings of the borrowers before disbursing loans branch officers also failed to take legal action against defaulters and dishonest borrowers
9189103 it should set up a system to detect high risk loans and reschedule repayment for borrowers who face difficulty in settling their loans
9189104 they should also make sure that their state offices obey instructions issued by the head office so that legal action is taken against defaulters of six months and above
9189105 disciplinary action should be taken against officers responsible for collecting defaulting payments but failed to do so
9189106 for example the acquisition of equipment through tender for four units of digital betacam recorders worth rm 710 000 was made only through an acceptance letter but no contract was signed it took between 15 to 45 days for two contracts worth rm35 23 million to be signed
9189107 there was also no written delegation of powers from the minister to the finas director general to sign a rm29 98 million dollar contract
9189108 the finas director general is only given powers to sign contracts worth rm5 million and below therefore the contract should have been signed by the minister or an officer he delegated power to but there was no proof of such delegation of power
9189109 it got easier as i trained and i spent quite a lot of time practising on the composition i like slow reflective pieces particularly the jewish ones

9189113 i approached the difficulties of that score section by section with the help of my mum a musician and my tutor mpo violinist marcus gundermann
9189114 technically this piece is simple and after you have played it for a while the contrapunctal lines of each of the four instruments are not distracting
9189115 i started practising the piece at the beginning of the year but then i had work commitments for the next two months i revived my practice for another month just before this concert
9189116 he helped me a lot in achieving the required level of fluency and articulation for that fast tempo

9189118 there are so many good artists in malaysia but only a handful of them particularly indian artists are regular exhibitors
9189119 this will be their ticket to show their works at bigger venues in the future
9189120 i have been painting since small art was something i excelled at in school
9189121 the saree and milk vessel in the painting are about 80 years old and they belonged to my mother in law my husband does not have a picture of his mother
9189122 i painted these images so that he has something to remember her by

9189133 sarah palin was against affirmative action because there where no african americans living in wasilla back in 2006 so she asked the kkk for help
9189134 das war nicht mehr als wir erwartet haben man kann das training nicht mit dem qualifying vergleichen denn auch dort haben wir unglaublich hart gearbeitet und uns vorbereitet
9189135 es wird sicher schwer irgendwie boden gut zu machen aber das ist eine aufgabe des teams ich muss nur so schnell wie m glich fahren
9189136 leider konnte ich die zeit sp ter nicht mehr wiederholen f r das rennen erhoffe ich mir einen platz auf das podium
9189137 besser h tte es f r uns eigentlich nicht laufen k nnen es w re sch n vor den eigenen fans auf dem podium zu stehen aber mit einem ergebnis um platz f nf w re ich sehr zufrieden
9189138 man kann in der paddock hill einen angriff versuchen und wenn der gegner dort blockt ergibt sich vielleicht in der zweiten kurve eine chance zum ausbremsen
9189139 ich habe nicht viel sp ter gebremst als sonst auch deshalb war ich berrascht ins kiesbett zu rutschen das war mir das ganze wochenende noch nicht passiert
9189140 das team hat einen tollen job gemacht und das auto wieder hergerichtet es musste sehr viel ausgetauscht werden vom k hllufteinl ssen bis hin zum diffusor es war viel arbeit und ich kann mich nur bedanken dass sich das auto danach wieder so gut anf hlte wie zuvor der speed des autos war wirklich gut
9189141 meine eigentliche heimat ist acht stunden von hier entfernt insofern empfinde ich das nicht wirklich als mein heimrennen es gibt keinen zus tzlichen druck
9189142 ich bin sehr zufrieden denn ich konnte meine rundenzeiten stetig verbessern
9189143 es ist sehr wichtig einen guten start hinzulegen denn bis zur ersten kurve ist es nicht weit
9189144 ich bin hoch motiviert aber ich brauche noch etwas zeit um wieder vollgas geben zu k nnen
9189145 ich hatte zu tun einen reifen f r vorn zu finden mit dem ich besser zurecht komme
9189146 einen guten start und dann versuchen irgendwie ein anst ndiges ergebnis einzufahren
9189147 es hilft sicher nicht aber das habe ich mir selbst eingebrockt

9189151 this is their livelihood and if they have opportunities they might take them if you were in a job and you were offered the opportunity to go and work in a similar job for the same pay or better pay why wouldnt you take it
9189152 so the players cant be criticised if they explore avenues that may well become open to them in the coming weeks
9189153 but i want to try to keep this team together and i hope that people can see at this stage that weve a lot of good going for us in cork
9189154 i believe passionately that we have an opportunity to have a proper full time league club in cork
9189155 but it needs investment it needs people to come in and match that passion as well as practicing prudent housekeeping
9189156 i think its very easy to start pointing the figure and im not going to start doing that
9189157 pointing the figure is not going to benefit us in any way going forward what i will say though is that the arkaga fund who have been putting funds into the club have obviously decided not to pursue that any further
9189158 so that has created problem because if you look at eircom league of ireland football its a long term game its not a short term strategy you have to be in it for the long haul
9189159 so i think you have to look at what way that actually deal took place was it done by people who were fully aware of what was expected of them to not just commit for a season but for three to five years minimum that would have taken the club forward
9189160 certainly when i came on board the right noises were being made and the right people were involved when i was recruited i felt
9189161 so we can only do our best as players and managers and work within the confines of a budget that weve been given and thats exactly what happened
9189162 there wasnt any item purchased or contract agreed without approval from up the line so people knew what was going on behind the scenes
9189163 i have some years experience of working in a financial institution so i know that youve got to work within your means but it wasnt my responsibility to balance the books
9189164 as a manager youre trying to improve your squad we brought good players in and we were building on that so i was always going to challenge the people above me to get a better squad
9189165 its our single biggest expense when you do 150 000 kegs a year at 150 a keg thats a lot of money for a little company like us
9189166 i think if you want to be part of the team that has a chance to win the stanley cup or a team that is going far in the playoffs my opinion has always been that you want to be there from training camp or the start of the season to be part of the group

9189168 he tomado la decisi n yo para nosotros sigue siendo el mismo jugador importante pero tenemos que mirar las condiciones en las que llega el jugador se ha visto que en las ltimas semanas la presi n de su entorno fue m s fuerte y el jugador no est en condiciones
9189169 hasta que no se resuelva el tema no podemos utilizarle para la supercopa era mejor no meterle y utilizar jugadores comprometidos con nosotros

9189207 the crisis erupted after the iraqi army entered without coordinating with kurdish leaders and ordered the kurdish parties to vacate the public buildings in khanaqin
9189208 we must continue the dialogue with all political parties to prevent those who want to derail the democratic process
9189209 the peshmergas left the place khanaqin on august 18 and were replaced by the iraqi forces which has angered the people who demonstrated on august 25 against the presence of the iraqi army

9189306 binnen de groep grenswetenschap nl leg ik de link tussen verleden en heden vanuit de mythologie
9189307 en het worden er meer en meer velen zien de profetie aankomen
9189308 stel de wereld draait door zoals nu dan wordt het steeds onplezieriger schaarste honger oorlogen ruimtetekort het elastiekje staat strak het is wachten tot ie p ts zegt maar daarvoor hebben we zelf gekozen niet als individu misschien maar allemaal samen de hopi indianen hebben in een ver verleden al gezegd dat we een verkeerde weg insloegen met onze vernietigingsdrang in 1990 hebben ze de vn gewaarschuwd dat het t laatste moment was om de koers te wijzigen kregen die indianen een kopje koffie en stonden ze weer buiten wij hebben zelf ons lot bezegeld en de een denkt dat de wereld vergaat door komeetinslagen de ander denkt dat ons dna zich splitst t zou allemaal best kunnen
9189309 de maya indianen rekenden niet met een lineaire tijd zoals wij doen van de geboorte van jezus tot de komst van de verlosser hun tijd was cyclisch alles zal weer plaatsvinden wij lopen nu tegen het einde van de vijfde zon de vierde zon werd afgesloten met een grote vloed hoe het nu zal eindigen wordt niet benoemd aardbevingen een nucleaire oorlog een poolkanteling een vloedgolf of systemen die in elkaar donderen hoe dan ook de wereld zoals je hem nu kent zal vergaan en dan is er een nieuw begin de zesde zon de maatschappij zal op een andere manier worden ingericht en wij hebben de keus zoals de hopis al zeiden tuurlijk zullen er overlevenden zijn net als in de ark van noach
9189310 het fijne van die maya kalender is dat hij te checken is en hij klopt tot nu hoe die indianen dat allemaal konden weten de mayas zelf waren zo stom als het achtereind van een varken ze hadden het wiel niet eens de kalender is terug te voeren op hun voorvaderen de tolteken en de olmeken en die oude beschavingen hadden het vermoedelijk weer van het eerste peruaanse volkje de quiche en die quiche verhaalden weer over een blanke bebaarde man die 4000 jaar voor christus van overzee kwam in maya taal noemden ze hem gevederde slang de mayas hebben het geluk gehad dat ze de overleveringen in geschrift hebben vastgelegd
9189311 heel relaxed bekijken wij thuis het nieuws en de verschuivingen in de wereld en dan moeten we heel hard lachen om alle bevestigingen die we krijgen levensverzekering en pensioen opgezegd natuurlijk met geld de spiegeltjes en de kraaltjes van onze samenleving beginnen we straks niks meer en dan daarbij moet ik nog op die beursjongens vertrouwen nee op 21 december 2012 ben ik niet in nederland maar op n van de safe locations met een boel drank feest aan het vieren
9189312 overleven betekent niet dat je als rambo met een kapmes door het oerwoud struint maar dat je als prooi de grootste vijand de hongerige medemens ontwijkt in kleine groepjes bereiden we ons voor op het cataclysme een plukje in limburg een clubje in friesland ik heb er een goed gevoel over de hopi indianen zeggen dat we zelf kunnen bepalen hoe de toekomst wordt en als er eind 2012 niets gebeurt dan hebben we een mooi feestje gehad tegen mensen die bang zijn zeg ik ook altijd ga door aan de slag leef eet geniet het komt vanzelf
9189313 maar gewoon thuis en ik zal proosten als met oud en nieuw een leukere wereld breekt aan
9189314 alles bestaat uit cycli kleine zoals de stand van de maan en de menstruatie en heel grote al die cycli vallen op 21 december 2012 samen al klinkt het schimmig de mayas wisten het via de buitenzintuiglijke wereld in trance is het tot ze gekomen los van elkaar kennen meer natuurvolkeren die datum de afrikaanse zoeloes en de nieuw zeelandse maoris noemen 2012 ook
9189315 in mijn praktijk als personal coach bespeurde ik al twaalf jaar geleden grote veranderingen bij mensen en ik dacht dit is groter dan ik in die tijd las ik een boek van jos argu lles over de tijd die materialistisch was en vanzelf meer spiritueel zou worden over de maya cyclus van 5000 jaar de lange tellingkalender van de mayas begint op 13 augustus 3114 voor christus en argu lles berekende dat egypte toen werd gesticht en rond die tijd de eerste stad in mesopotami uruk hij zag het als de weergave van onze geschiedenis het is in irak begonnen en zal daar eindigen daar zit wat in elke cyclus bestaat uit dat wat je zaait en dat wat je oogst
9189316 ik zie 2012 als een schop onder de kont t speelkwartier is afgelopen als we zo doorhobbelen is de planeet straks op het is een dubbeltje op zn kant als ik het op een rijtje zet herkennen mensen al die dingen direct de geldeconomie staat op instorten bankmensen weten dat trouwens al twintig jaar maar waren bang om paniek te zaaien de ijskappen smelten russische wetenschappers stellen dat het aantal natuurrampen sinds 1974 met 500 procent is toegenomen
9189317 om de 26 000 jaar verandert er iets vorige keer is de neanderthaler uitgestorven en heeft de homo sapiens de planeet veroverd nu breekt aquarius het watermantijdperk aan wij zijn het technologiepad ingeslagen en ik denk dat we nu meer naar de innerlijke technologie gaan een bewustzijnsverandering misschien dat we straks telepathisch kunnen communiceren
9189318 ik heb vrienden die met het 2012 verhaal in hun achterhoofd naar de pyrenee n zijn vertrokken hoog en droog overleven met een waterput en een groentetuintje ik zie het meer als een spirituele weg
9189319 ik ben genoeg voor gek verklaard maar wetenschap is k maar een stelsel van aannames
9189320 bangmakerij het wordt gebaseerd op de maya kalender en die kent een cyclische jaartelling dat betekent niks bijzonders alleen dat het om de zoveel tijd opnieuw begint geen enkele reden om aan te nemen dat 2012 het einde van de wereld is ik heb wel eens iets gelezen over die maya kalender maar dat wordt altijd zo ingewikkeld en omslachtig uitgelegd dat het niet te volgen is
9189321 mensen raken al helemaal over hun toeren als er drie nullen achter elkaar staan tijdens de jaarwisseling naar het jaar 2000 zou onze hele beschaving toch ook instorten en velen riepen dat in 2005 de wereld zou vergaan het is een volkssport om het einde der tijden aan te kondigen sektes genoeg maar vroeger volgde men met een clubje n enkele goeroe nu praten ze elkaar op internet allemaal na ik kan dat niet serieus nemen mensen willen nieuwe fantasieverhalen horen nu er niets meer te lezen valt over harry potter
9189322 de achterliggende gedachte was dat mensen zich voor kapitalen verzekeren maar niet zelfredzaam zijn
9189323 zij houden zich serieus bezig met het einde van de wereld al denkt de n aan een vloed en een ander aan een nucleaire ramp sommigen richten hun bestedingspatroon zo in dat voor die datum hun geld op is ze zeggen hun pensioen op en schaffen een noodrantsoen aan dat lang houdbaar is anderen redeneren dat ze alleen een pistool nodig hebben om dan aan eten te komen ik denk dat mensen bij een catastrofe uiteindelijk het bangst moeten zijn voor de buurman voor anarchie in afwachting van 2012 zijn meerdere groepen bezig zich te equiperen in schuilkelders op geheime locaties ze trekken zich terug in zelfvoorzienende gemeenschappen niet alleen met lang houdbaar voedsel maar ook met zaden bij mij komen ze ook voor de basics zoals ei en boterpoeder
9189324 welnee maar het beklemt me dat ik deze week op de radio ineens de term koude oorlog weer hoorde vallen en het benauwt me ook dat veel mensen uit de beleggingswereld nu ineens spullen bij mij aanschaffen wat weten zij dat ik niet weet een beurskrach

9189361 spent the summer arguing that a 40 something candidate with four years in major office and no significant foreign policy experience was not ready to be president and then on friday he picked as his running mate a 40 something candidate with two years in major office and no significant foreign policy experience
9189362 the question is gop lobbyist ed rogers continued what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready the question is particularly acute for mr mccain who turned 72 on friday and would be the oldest person elected to a first term as president if he won in november his campaign now needs to convince the public that it can imagine in the oval office a candidate who has spent just two years as governor of a state with a quarter of the population of brooklyn
9189363 though john mccain clearly concluded that palin could attract female voters and grab his campaign some barack obama style media buzz he also is taking a risk that in elevating a largely unknown figure he undermines the central theme of his candidacy that he puts country first above political calculations
9189364 for a candidate known to possess a quick temper and an unpredictable political streak the decision raises questions about how mccain would lead whether his decisions would flow from careful deliberations or gut checks in which short term considerations or feelings outweigh the long view
9189365 palin is an unorthodox selection but could help mccain reach out to women especially disaffected democrats who supported hillary clinton but she could be vulnerable to democratic criticism that she is not ready to be president a particular concern when mccain turns 72 today and would be the oldest person elected to a first term as president
9189366 john mccains advisers predicted weeks ago that the presumptive republican nominee would use his national convention week to try to recapture his image as a maverick reformer and shake up the presidential race he did just that friday with his surprise choice of alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9189367 mccains selection of the nationally untested palin is the most unlikely choice of a running mate since george h w bush tapped then sen dan quayle in 1988 a move as risky as it was bold the decision brings the senator from arizona immediate dividends with his base and eventually perhaps with swing voters but it comes at potentially significant cost to his effort to discredit democratic nominee barack obama as unprepared for the presidency
9189368 for all the enthusiasm palins selection generated among conservative constituencies many gop strategists were privately bewildered by mccains decision
9189369 i want to believe this is a game changer but when i close my eyes i see new orleans in 1988 said a dumbstruck republican operative recalling the convention where vice president george h
9189370 democrats will have a field day typecasting her as quayle in a pantsuit
9189371 mccain does not believe in pandering to identity politics he was looking for someone who was well prepared to fight against international islamic extremism the transcendent issue of our time and in the end he decided that in good conscience he was not going to settle for anyone who had not been commander of a state national guard for at least a year and a half he put down his foot the obvious choice was palin the governor of alaska whose guard stands as our last best defense against possible attack by the resurgent russian menace across the bering strait
9189372 the idea that women are going to race off to vote for any candidate with the same internal plumbing is both offensive and historically wrong when the sexes have parted company in modern elections its generally been because women are more likely to be democrats and more concerned about protecting the social safety net

9189382 americans dont necessarily want somebody in a time of crisis to be overly emotional
9189383 thats the balance that john mccains going to have to show the public
9189384 but it also speaks to a very hyper political decision obviously he doesnt have any history with sarah palin he doesnt know her it seems to be a calculated push toward gaining women voters

9189437 gemeinsam zur arbeit und nach hause zu fahren schont den geldbeutel und die umwelt gleicherma en
9189438 il faut aussi un chef d quipe qui a une paisseur

9189441 il faut changer oeuvrer pour une vraie majorit de renouveau
9189442 ive always had an interest in homes and d cor
9189443 the internet is such a great place to develop a business
9189444 theres no pressure from a sales person to make a purchase
9189445 weve added some new outdoor items like lawn decorations in addition to our indoor d cor
9189446 but the reality is that this is an ongoing project i want to add items that i find interesting and beautiful
9189447 i want to be able to discuss ideas for home living with others
9189448 theres a amount of comfort and security in the home and i really want to be able to exchange ideas with other people no two thoughts are the same and its good to get the perspective of others
9189449 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9189450 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9189451 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9189452 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9189453 but there are things we can and will do better
9189454 i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible
9189455 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason
9189456 and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9189457 de anti fascisten waren niet te spreken over het optreden van de politie het is volstrekt belachelijk dat wij uit elkaar zijn geslagen waarom richten ze zich niet tegen de zo werd uit hun mond opgetekend
9189458 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
9189459 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
9189460 it is difficult for us to explain how insulting this decision is to our intelligence and judgment as a women but we will try
9189461 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
9189462 i cant play with you because i am too tired or i feel embarrassed to go with you because of my weight
9189463 there are currently too many unknowns i mean what if the water is hosting a new bacterium or the oxygen levels in the atmosphere are just half a percentage point too high soil animals temperature plant life there are so many ways they could have been planning our demise on that planet its mind boggling it will take years for us to determine whether or not it is safe i strongly suggest those who were planning the initial colonization put those plans on an indefinite hold
9189464 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers
9189465 save me from myself how i found god quit korn kicked drugs and lived to tell my story
9189466 right now weve got an in store record store tour
9189467 id say both in the beginning i was stressed out but i was having fun i was goin through challenges ya know when you do methamphetamine it messes with your emotions and mind and stuff partying for that many years its like a kid goin to the candy store every day sooner or later hes gonna end up sick and unhealthy ya know after time passes you start to become more normal again but i had a lot of fits or rage i would break things in the studio if things didnt go my way so that had to go but the times when things were goin really good were fun while i was going through those challenges i could take time off i would take like even six months off ya know in 2006 i hadnt done music for a while and just wanted to take a break it was cool to do that because there was no pressure there was no one tellin me dude you gotta get into the studio and finish this weve got a deadline there was no deadline it was just whatever happened ya know everything happened the way it was supposed to because im a new man now im totally calm when things dont do my way i dont freak out im just a new person and it feels great
9189468 the party announced its draft revision of science and technology policy to help iraq activation ceremony will be performed in switzerland in the first of the month of september to attend the next united nations secretary general ban ki moon and minister of science and technology iraqi raid fahmi the president of the united nations conference on trade and development
9189469 while the performance of iraq at one time the best in the region however deteriorated in recent years
9189470 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9189471 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9189472 too often we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought
9189473 i would rather die on the hill of integrity than live in the valley of compromise
9189474 in the light of the moon they dance and dissappear their forms reflect upon the wall like those before rebirth
9189475 ich habe heute viel positives gesehen defensiv wie offensiv wir sind f r unsere intensive trainingsarbeit belohnt worden und haben uns selbstvertrauen geholt jeder fan der heute im stadion war hat das spiel genossen die stimmung war super f r jeden spieler ist es fantastisch hier aufzulaufen

9189482 sendo a primeira mulher candidata de um dos dois grandes partidos ela e walter mondale foram derrotados entre as pr prias mulheres por uma diferen a de 12 pontos por ronald reagan e george bush padre
9189483 claramente mais dif cil para mccain poder criticar a experi ncia de obama
9189484 hoje john mccain p s a ex prefeita de uma cidade de 9 000 habitantes com nenhuma experi ncia em pol tica externa a um passo da presid ncia
9189485 sua experi ncia no governo consiste em menos de dois anos como governadora de seu estado escassamente povoado mais seis anos como prefeita de wasilla de 8
9189486 al m disso n o tem experi ncia em pol tica externa nem em seguran a nacional o que inclui o terrorismo que mccain anuncia como o maior desafio dos estados unidos e do mundo
9189487 compreende os problemas as esperan as os valores dos trabalhadores
9189488 eu n o acho que isso pode ter grande impacto todo mundo j sabe que o presidente lula do pt e que ele ap ia a candidata do pt h meses ela vem tentando colar sua imagem ao presidente lula eu vou colar minha imagem s pessoas indo de casa em casa
9189489 vamos enfrentar uma m quina com aquilo que temos de melhor enquanto eles colam em candidato n s colamos em voc s
9189490 de acompanhar como ele est articulando sua candidatura presid ncia do senado
9189491 before the internet we only had access to peoples eyes and ears via their living rooms that was enough for us to suck out their souls and we did that
9189492 then came the internet and social networks now the internet is like a needle that lets us get inside our consumers into their bloodstream now we can move around inside them and look for that soul less void we left and put up our billboards right there
9189493 billboards saying we can make it alright again buy more of our stuff it is environmentally friendly now and you can buy it with one click it is brilliant it is branding on the inside i can sell anything to anyone now just let me make friends with them on facebook first
9189494 even a cursory glance at palins positions should be enough to warn democratic women and men to stay far far away the governors
9189495 i am pro life and i believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman
9189496 i support flexibility in government regulations that allow competition in health care that is needed
9189497 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9189498 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9189499 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9189500 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9189501 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9189502 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work
9189503 as hillary clinton aptly stated senator mccain has a lifetime of experience
9189504 he will use that experience as president to keep taxes low for american families and small businesses grow the economy and reduce our nations independence on foreign oil
9189505 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9189506 we will start moving residents from the 17 pickup areas that are located throughout the city
9189507 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9189508 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9189509 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed
9189510 i just broke it a couple times just to be thorough
9189511 you guys kept me in there when i was losing my head
9189512 if this crowd comes with me the whole way who knows
9189513 it felt like a party in the stadium on switchovers
9189514 i dont think hes even old enough to go out yet is he i knew i had him then
9189515 i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9189516 i guess they call it the yips on your serve i dont know where it came from
9189517 probably came from all my years making fun of people that had it that was my karma coming back
9189518 when he steps up and is hitting his shots he hits so hard theres not a lot you can do he literally just cracks the ball
9189519 i just tried sticking around and mixed up the paces a little bit
9189520 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9189521 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9189522 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9189523 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9189524 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9189525 at no time did it indicate its intention to substitute the aircraft that suffered the accident
9189526 later it told the airport control centre that it was keeping it
9189527 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9189528 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9189529 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9189530 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9189531 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9189532 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9189533 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9189534 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9189535 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9189536 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9189537 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence
9189538 calls for the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9189539 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9189540 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9189541 but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9189542 organising a celebration of peace and sport in an area near where there was a massacre and a war of aggression seems to me to be a strange idea
9189543 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9189544 they wanted to make an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resources
9189545 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9189546 supporting the army is mandatory because it is the only protector of lebanon and it upholds its stability
9189547 questions regarding the extent of coordination between the lebanese army and hezbollah
9189548 resisting an external attack is a non controversial issue this is the duty of the lebanese people
9189549 blocking the re creation of the state for tens of years
9189550 we can take about five and a half feet 1 67 meters of water above sea level but we cant take the nine to 12 feet 2 7 to 3 7 meters theyre talking about
9189551 im supposed to be leaving but i keep waiting just a little longer to see what the storm is going to do i know its a risk
9189552 this morning president bush called four governors whose states are in the potential path of hurricane gustav
9189553 president bush called to make sure the states were receiving all the assistance they needed from the federal government he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9189554 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9189555 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9189556 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9189557 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9189558 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9189559 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9189560 i feel like our way of life is being destroyed
9189561 we have been anticipating heavy network traffic for months and methodically increased our network capacity to accommodate the expected network usage of technologically savvy attendees
9189562 we are very pleased that we were able to meet the demand and keep our customers connected to their world while attending this exciting event
9189563 we have addressed emergency plans in each location and have contacted high acuity patients to make sure they are safe and understand their own evacuation plans
9189564 we have also connected those patients with other locations around the region we have contacted all our oxygen patients and explained to them that we have set up at least 12 depots in local towns where they can come by and get supplies if needed
9189565 with the lessons we learned from katrina and other hurricanes we feel that we are prepared to handle anything that is thrown at us
9189566 many investors believe october is the worst month for equity market returns this can be partly attributable to the fact some large one day declines have occurred in october
9189567 in actuality though the worst month for market returns is september although the average return in september is negative the magnitude of the decline was no worse than one to 1 5 percent
9189568 the economy is weaker than the gdp data might suggest and is not expected to repeat the growth of the first half
9189569 risks of another contraction in real gdp will remain elevated through the first half of 2009 as labor and housing markets search for their bottoms
9189570 in the face of gale force winds from the housing credit and commodity markets the economy continues to bend but not break
9189571 we saw a slight improvement in auto sales in july but dont expect to see a major recovery for the remainder of the year
9189572 have spelled recession other indicators not a divergence that should continue in the week ahead
9189573 while economic growth seems to be in the minds of everybody i still worry about inflation
9189574 the trend is clearly upwards and will continue to remain on that path if the federal reserve continues to be as irresponsible as it has been until now
9189575 how long can a business keep prices constant when facing an almost 10 percent increase in the price of its inputs
9189576 the wind was a little nerve wracking the howling but it turned out ok
9189577 discrimination has no place in a nation founded on equality
9189578 defined by deep and meaningful equality from womens rights to gay rights
9189579 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9189580 my voice is my credential listen to this al you minium
9189581 its very pretty but im not sure we can do anything with it
9189582 we felt if we prayed and obeyed gods word and did what he asked that he would help us be successful
9189583 integritys employees regularly prayed before meetings or in branch lobbies with customers
9189584 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
9189585 el proceso de otorgamiento de becas todav a no termin
9189586 la beca no es una pol tica universal es para aquellos que m s lo necesitan de esta manera la van a cobrar los que est n en situaci n de vulnerabilidad social y econ mica

9189588 los chicos son sujetos de derechos pol ticos o no
9189589 puede ocurrir que la familia tenga una casa propia en un barrio carenciado o que el jefe de hogar no tenga trabajo
9189590 hay 60 000 solicitudes sobre un total de 110 alumnos
9189591 en una ciudad con 67 mil planes de ciudadan a porte a y m s de 30 mil tickets para alimentos es posible que haya esa cantidad de solicitudes
9189592 el ministro no pudo explicar cu l hab a sido el criterio para rechazar las becas que no fueron asignadas
9189593 no dijo por qu en la escuela padre mugica de la villa 31 quedaron el 50 por ciento de los chicos sin cobertura de beca
9189594 no se trata de un conflicto por razones presupuestarias sino por voluntad pol tica el ministerio tiene un presupuesto de 24 7 millones destinado a becas de los cuales s lo asign 16 3 millones de acuerdo con la resoluci n 4251 del ministerio de educaci n
9189595 todav a no termin el proceso de reconsideraci n y de ser necesario si el presupuesto no es suficiente se reasignar n partidas
9189596 no se entiende qu van a reconsiderar si no explican cu l es el criterio por el que fueron rechazados
9189597 parece que el macrismo pretende que los chicos se cuelguen un cartel que diga soy pobre para que le den una beca
9189598 mientras el gobierno de macri env a a la legislatura una ampliaci n presupuestaria de 100 millones para subsidiar a la educaci n privada no hace lo mismo para otorgar m s becas a los chicos de las escuelas p blicas
9189599 el ministro gener un conflicto innecesario y socialmente injusto lo que configura un error pol tico inexcusable
9189600 americans are just beginning to discover that gov palin is an experienced executive who has held office since 1992 and demonstrated time and again her willingness to roll up her sleeves and taken action

9189605 it is possible to master leadership under conditions of shared responsibility
9189606 throughout my 20 years in the field ive found one fundamental principle that accounts for the difference between truly great team builders and those who are average struggling or failing the difference is in how they deal with personal and shared responsibility effective teams feel it on effective teams if one person drops the ball another picks it up and if one person makes a mistake or falls behind another lends a hand low and average performing teams seem to lack this sense of shared responsibility i developed the knowledge team leadership program to give team leaders and members the tools they need to deliver results and have fun with any team starting immediately

9189781 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9189782 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9189783 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9189784 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9189785 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9189786 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9189787 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9189788 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9189789 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9189790 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9189791 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9189792 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9189793 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9189794 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9189795 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9189796 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9189797 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9189798 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9189799 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9189800 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9189801 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9189802 who are open to doing something on the production side
9189803 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9189804 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9189805 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9189806 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9189807 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9189808 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9189809 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9189810 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9189811 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9189812 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9189813 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9189814 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9189815 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9189816 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9189817 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9189818 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9189819 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9189820 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9189821 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9189822 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9189823 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9189824 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9189825 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9189826 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9189827 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9189828 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9189829 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9189830 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9189831 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9189832 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9189833 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9189834 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9189835 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9189836 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9189837 even though it is john mccains 72nd birthday it looks like barack obama and joe biden got the best gift with mccains choice of sarah palin to be mccains running mate
9189838 in an election mccain claims is about experience and security he picks someone who barely has the equivalent of a learners permit in elected office let alone foreign affairs she has served well under two years as governor and her prior experience as a mayor of a town with 9 000 people does not qualify her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
9189839 governor palins lack of experience and thin record give us no choice but to return to the clear facts that john mccain has a long and terrible record of failing americas workers mccains record is a train wreck for families who want a shot at the american dream and this choice his first as a presidential candidate shows a serious lack of judgment and understanding about what this election is about
9189840 it is important to realize that while the governors husband is a member of a union this does not automatically qualify her for an on the job training program to become a heartbeat away from the presidency
9189841 and while her husband is one of 850 000 dues paying members of the steelworkers union it does nothing to absolve sen mccain of his long history of anti union sentiment and anti worker actions including continuously pushing an anti working family agenda
9189842 mccains choice is another example of his poor judgment and his desire to play politics as usual
9189843 mccain palin is not a team that works for working families the first term governors record is thin and divisive and john mccain has a life long record of being for the rich and powerful no union card can hide that any more than ronald regans union card did

9189875 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9189876 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9189877 but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9189878 the banks are in the same position and could easily do the same but while they were very quick to hike their rates independently to the rba when funding costs were increasing earlier this year they are now just stalling waiting until an announcement by the rba
9189879 they have talked for months about how they must concentrate on their own cost of funds not the cash rate now is the time for them to back up their rhetoric with action
9189880 they are boosting their bottom line instead of passing those savings to onto their customers
9189881 we are the last non bank lender standing and the banks cannot just keep widening their profit margins and charging what they like while wizard is on the scene offering honest good value mortgages
9189882 if the banks dont compete with us customers will switch away from the banks because the savings could be huge
