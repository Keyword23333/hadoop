5860030 if he wants to play in the champions trophy he has to clear the fine before the event starts on september 12

5860039 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5860040 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased

5860046 it will not be moved from pakistan i am not even willing to answer any questions to that effect
5860047 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5860048 if ca has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise
5860049 they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5860050 our information is specific to being an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5860051 we advise you to reconsider your need to travel to sri lanka at this time because of the very high risk of politically motivated violence
5860052 the ideal situation would be for the icc to move the event because from an aca perspective our players wont be going to pakistan and they want to play in the champions trophy
5860053 sri lanka has its own set of concerns for us
5860054 the primary concern is that we have a well established process for assessing the security situation wherever we go theres 20 days between now and the start of the event does that give us enough time to assess the situation in sri lanka
5860055 we have nominated as the back up venue we can hold all the games in colombo or if they want to go out we can go out
5860056 we already have india here playing in one day and test series we have just hosted the saarc south asian association for regional cooperation meeting i cant see how sri lanka is unsafe

5860369 arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes speak in a low soothing and pleasant voice
5860370 dont ask him questions about his actions or question his judgment or integrity remember he is the master of the house and as such will always exercise his will with fairness and truthfulness you have no right to question him
5860371 after providing your husband with a healthful meal washing the dishes and putting your little treasures of children to bed join your husband in the marital bed and open your vagina to him so you may perform your wifely duty
5860372 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5860373 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5860374 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one
5860375 why should it be spoiled unless someone tries to spoil it for me
5860376 im going to out there to run my heart out
5860377 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5860378 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5860379 if you look to your left youll see alcatraz island which sits on 22 acres about 1
5860380 the sbc will be funded from within existing budgets and will be supported by scottish government staff and use existing offices
5860381 mr jenkins will receive a daily allowance as chair of 387 based on that paid to the chair of the previous administrations cultural commission but members of the commission will be unremunerated
5860382 the cultural commission budget was around 500 000 while a similar figure has been set for the scottish broadcasting commission budget it is expected that the commissions overall spend will be less as the timescale is to be quicker and speedier as agreed with the commission chair blair jenkins
5860383 it is absolutely astonishing that the snp believe this is the best use of half a million pounds of taxpayers money
5860384 the snp are paying hundreds of thousands of pounds to fund their commission set up to look at something they have no responsibility for while at the same time they are looking at making cuts to areas that are important to the people of scotland
5860385 as a defence lawyer i would say no it wouldnt be a good thing
5860386 but if i wear my citizens hat i would say if you go along to any estate and see the age of kids marauding around like a pack of wolves youd see that reducing the age of criminal responsibility to eight or nine would be vital
5860387 i mean if you look at how children are treated by government and legislation you have to be 18 to be able to vote 16 to have sex and yet 10 to be held accountable for committing a crime
5860388 the best approach to serious child offenders is to deal with them as children who need effective care measures
5860389 the money spent on children when they are small on actually getting them to enjoy and start exercising will be paid back enormously later on
5860390 its going to cost the country and the county of kent an awful lot more to look after obese people and people with illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease
5860391 we have lots and lots of lunchtime activities where we have equipment available for the students to be able to pick up and do any kind of activity they want
5860392 i think whats more important than just looking at the equipment is the staffing issues because activity has got to be fun for young people
5860393 risk that those individuals will be vilified and as a consequence their mental or physical health will suffer
5860394 if i see jim sorgi taking snaps in the first quarter of the final regular season game
5860395 why am i so nervous all the others seem almost calm and relaxed
5860396 i dont give a damn you cant stand what i say anyhow
5860397 yes but thats the way you react any time i come from a conference
5860398 number one and foremost we have to stop collecting the fee
5860399 union city councilmembers will meet in private on thursday to talk about making those payments hopefully without reducing police fire and other vital city services a public discussion will take place next tuesday the refunds to telephone customers would average about 32 dollars per household
5860400 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy
5860401 we need a call to action not a call to go to another conference
5860402 im kind of scared myself because i live here by myself
5860403 they tied them up with lamp cords and they wouldnt let them go anywhere
5860404 by the time we got to the residence and got the road shut down and we found the individuals had already left
5860405 i dont really know what to say trouble coming this close to home
5860406 i am truly grateful for all the prayers that we had the whole community got involved people we dont even know were praying
5860407 what happens is when you have dementia you make wrong decision you turn the wrong way you get bewildered on your way back
5860408 a person tends to not respond when theyre called so we can help law enforcement help enhance the search for a person with dementia
5860409 were going to get together with the family and discuss what were going to do but right now shes at home and shes resting peacefully resting pretty good
5860410 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5860411 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5860412 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5860413 a clearer picture of the entire housing market will emerge once more of these foreclosures burn off and more lenders sellers and buyers get off the sidelines and back into the housing game
5860414 its like finding a needle in a haystack and its dark down there
5860415 it is just not good enough that some parents are going without out the maintenance they need to bring up their children
5860416 but i would also urge those parents to work with us to keep the lines of communication open
5860417 they should give us whatever information they can to help track down and secure payments from those parents who evade and avoid their responsibility
5860418 it reflects the type of enquiries weve had from lone parents since the agency has existed basically it means money isnt getting to children who need it
5860419 that causes poverty it traps lone parents on benefits and stops them getting into work and lets non resident parents away with their responsibilities of maintaining children
5860420 this deal with annington means that the mod is contractually obliged to pay rent on the homes occupied by service families
5860421 this equates to an average monthly rent of 300 substantially less than if the mod was paying the open market rent for similar properties
5860422 are now of the highest standard for condition which has increased from 40 in 2001
5860423 mod recognises that good quality housing is a fundamental part of the welfare package we give to our armed forces personnel and their families
5860424 when youre asking these guys to go out to afghanistan and iraq in a worst case scenario they are giving their lives its very important that the families are in a community together with people who understand what they are going through who can help with their children and who can talk through things
5860425 does not give them the ministry of defence an excuse to offer sub standard accommodation when some of these guys and ladies are giving their lives
5860426 if students are at risk of being permanently excluded we avoid that by putting them on an agreed transfer to another school for four to five weeks
5860427 if that doesnt work then permanent exclusion goes ahead so its a last chance and a change of scene often helps
5860428 we saw a 31 reduction in permanent exclusions in that cluster last year
5860429 we are looking at rolling that out across the county because we can see it having a positive impact
5860430 i have listened to two medway head teachers and the authority
5860431 smallpox is probably the greatest killer of human beings that has ever been known as a single disease
5860432 the refusal of police forces to provide basic information on the use of taxpayers money is difficult to understand
5860433 it is not as if we have been asking for operational details on the informants used by the police which understandably should remain as confidential information
5860434 but surely the public is entitled to a rough idea on the amount of public money spent on informants in the interests of transparency
5860435 that highlights the dangers there are when an informant is paid for information
5860436 there is scrutiny of this process there will be records within each agency making payments to sources but there is no centrally aggregated figure
5860437 it is open to chief officers to make details of payments made to sources available to the police authority and for the police authority to scrutinise the payments made to sources as part of its audit and assurance responsibilities
5860438 i did not realise that the metropolitan police authority could scrutinise these accounts and i will be requesting that they do it is unbelievable that these payments do not get scrutinised in some way by a publicly accountable body
5860439 there is a global figure for the amount spent on the security services which is going up but we would not break it down into what is spent on covert human intelligence sources
5860440 it is part of the governments over arching policy not to discuss the details of such matters
5860441 the police ought to be open about it and if they think that its a justified use of taxpayers money they should tell us how much they have spent if they have got nothing to hide they should be open about it
5860442 it is a murky and complex and unsavoury world most of these people lie for a living the trick is to find the lie and the truth
5860443 its quite likely that the spending is going up as the police become more focused on organised crime and terrorism but you just dont know
5860444 even if there is a trend the question is are they getting value for money for that spending
5860445 even someone like me who has been on the receiving end fully believes that the public has a duty to help the police with providing crime intelligence
5860446 but can it be right for police officers to have the power to induce with public funds one suspect to give evidence against another suspect who the police officer thinks is the most guilty
5860447 would we get a second car so you could drive to the train
5860448 y no por sectores privados que bajo el membrete de laicos han difundido la fe cat lica
5860449 hemos estudiado la constituci n con nuestros juristas y estamos de acuerdo en que consagra muchos avances
5860450 algunos s lo hacen con fe aceptan la disciplina de estudiar la biblia y ser enviados a casas de rehabilitaci n pero otros lo hacen para vigilar a los pastores y a los miembros de la iglesia para despu s extorsionarlos
5860451 a ellos no les importa qu tipo de fe profesan pues sabemos que iglesias nazarenas conservadoras pentecostales y neopentecostales han sido extorsionadas tambi n
5860452 dont you think youre spending an awful lot of time at meetings you never have time for your son
5860453 i think the union is more important than babying ones kids but thats just like a woman
5860454 lets meet without a fixed agenda now and then and take turns baking cakes for the meetings
5860455 we dont meet here to nibble on cakes nor to ramble on about nothing of all the things ive heard this really tops it were supposed to be serious here
5860456 but its always the same people who speak at the meetings so i just thought we could try to change our style a bit and then it would
5860457 well its certainly not my fault that some people wont speak up why dont they go and take a course in public speaking after all this is not a nursery school
5860458 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5860459 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
5860460 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5860461 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5860462 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

5860471 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5860472 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
5860473 i have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception
5860474 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence
5860475 tropic thunder is insulting and hurtful to me and others

5860478 in light of the statutory purpose of determining whether signers are qualified electors we find it difficult to see how a post office box address renders a signature invalid per se if an elections official can verify that the signer is a qualified elector
5860479 in some instances the election official may even have the post office box address on file
5860480 legislative clarification of the statutory requirements for signatures on candidate nominating petitions would be helpful to both candidates and election officials

5860520 russias message in the five day clashes in the caucasus was clear the region is still the backyard of moscow which is the main actor that would ensure the energy supply security for europe in other words the sudden spark in the conflict that brought georgia to its heels reasserted russias claim as the dominant force in the region and dealt a blow to the u s prestige this conflict came at a time when turkey started sending signals that it wants to boost cooperation with its top gas supplier russia
5860521 we are four neighboring countries with shared cultures and civilizations and very broad beliefs we think there are enough issues to necessitate for ontinuous holding of continuous four sided talks the security joint investment campaign against terrorism and organized crime are among the issues that make it necessary for the four countries to hold talks continuously and to act harmoniously with one another

5860630 this time ill find the bag of gold and pay off the mortgage
5860631 i got the gold heres a stinkin hairbrush for you

5860636 we didnt promise that youd get better mileage we just said these people told us they personally got better mileage

5860640 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being

5860643 you will spend less time in this chair if you floss every day
5860644 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5860645 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5860646 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5860647 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5860648 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5860649 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5860650 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5860651 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5860652 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence

5860694 after finishing our second cd mundos opuestos opposite worlds it was very important for us to take some time to keep silent and find out about our feelings what we wanted to say and how to say it we traveled a lot on tours before we were able to start composing the songs
5860695 traveling enriches your life as a person because you realize that this world is not just you your family and friends
5860696 you realize that there is more culture there are languages foods other ways of life and that helped us to grow and live
5860697 that song is about resignation because you realize your relationship becomes repetitive in order to avoid accepting the fact there isnt any love left
5860698 at that moment you have to stop to avoid living out of habit
5860699 we wrote it on a bus on our way to nashville to record after saying goodbye to our family in louisiana

5860877 la fijaci n de objetivos y la prioridad que se marca a partir de establecer a la educaci n como uno de los ejes
5860878 la educaci n es uno de los ejes que establecimos como prioridad de nuestro gobierno el elemento central al que se tiene que abocar la pol tica para obtener resultados es la educaci n porque es lo que define nuestro grado de libertad
5860879 nosotros queremos pertenecer al mundo y desde la educaci n nos queremos medir para volver a compararnos porque apostamos a una educaci n p blica gratuita de calidad y de excelencia
5860880 el primero est referido a la calidad y para eso deben haber evaluaciones el segundo es el desaf o de la inclusi n que tiene que ser igual para todos con el mismo punto de partida el tercero es el rol del docente y la prioridad ser apoyar su rol educativo
5860881 el cuarto desaf o es el tema de la tecnolog a y el idioma ya que en el mundo en que vivimos son necesarios ambos instrumentos el ltimo es la articulaci n del mundo educativo con el mundo laboral que debe ser armoniosa

5860887 estoy viviendo momentos de inmensa alegr a todo esto es muy loco todav a no salgo del asombro sigo disfrutando y quisiera grabar en la memoria todo lo vivido en beijing

5860892 hubo una buena onda fue muy lindo el gesto que tuvieron los integrantes de la delegaci n argentina cuando gan la medalla el saludo de manu gin bili me emocion es una persona muy sencilla que a uno la hace sentir bien
5860893 todo es muy es muy loco dif cil de explicar
5860894 a veces los malos fallos te hacen perder una medalla y eso era lo que m s tem a
5860895 por eso les ped a dios y a los jueces que no se equivocaran ya que estaba ante el momento m s importante de mi carrera
5860896 claro que en principio el juez no me estaba dando el triunfo pero despu s cambi el fallo y me dio ganadora
5860897 esta fue la alegr a m s grande que viv es obvio que lo diga no se si alguna vez tendr otro igual

5860905 it was a beautiful model but there were parts of it that didnt add up and those parts directly conflicted with the model published in 2001
5860906 this suggests that the steric occlusion model best explains the available biochemical and structural evidence that has been published
5860907 any evidence positive or negative will help focus our attention toward this goal
5860908 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
5860909 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
5860910 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
5860911 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
5860912 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
5860913 but at this point it is certainly hard to recommend extra supplements when we dont have proof of benefit
5860914 what we can recommend is a diet with fruits and vegetables that have antioxidant vitamins in them
5860915 maybe this will be another motivator to either keep people active or motivate them to become active if theyre not
5860916 this is a questionable concept since we do not know the strength of the direction or association between physical health and mental function
5860917 here is when we ask which comes first the egg or the chicken
5860918 by being able to detect the fact that theyre on the path to dementia i think well be able in the future to target better therapies that might prevent the onset or potentially to prepare the ground for the person in the family to face the disease
5860919 so if you can improve that element of the way our bodies work which is what physical fitness does youre going to be also protecting the brain from cognitive decline
5860920 and conversely if you can maintain your brain function by exercising it you may also be improving your ability to stay physically active
5860921 whats known is that people who exercise are less likely to get dementia but people who exercise might be different in other ways

5860969 as far as we know this is the first time since cain and abel that all the blessings of the gospel of jesus christ were made available to all people of all races living upon this earth and it was the first time that temple ordinances could be performed for all people back to the beginning of time from the beginning the lord has sent the gospel to people according to his priorities and the priesthood has been given selectively during the fourteen centuries from moses to christ only the house of israel had the gospel

5860972 he then learned that when the lord commanded it as he had with the patriarchs anciently a man could have more than one living wife at a time and not be condemned for adultery he also understood that the church would one day be required to live the law d amp c 132 1 4 28 40
5860973 the book of mormon makes clear that though the lord will command men through his prophets to live the law of plural marriage at special times for his purposes monogamy is the general standard jacob 2 28 30 unauthorized polygamy was and is viewed as adultery another safeguard was that authorized plural marriages could be performed only through the sealing power controlled by the presiding authority of the church d amp c 132 19

5861071 as much as wed like to go out and play the whole new album that would bore the majority of our audience all but the most diehard were very fortunate to have an absolute truckload of hits its actually very difficult for us because we have to decide which songs to play

5861107 the worst is yet to come in the u s the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out rates are too low they must realize were going to get inflation if things stay where they are they need to raise rates but i dont think they are going to because theyre way too nervous fhlmc and fnma should have been closed down 10 years ago they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds

5861111 la personalidad as es que el s bado hay que hacer bien las cosas hay que ganar no pasa nada tengo la personalidad suficiente para salir adelante
5861112 lo que me pas son cosas del futbol hay que aprender ahora para el partido del s bado ante santos no tenemos que preocuparnos por lo que haga santos sino por lo que nosotros podamos hacer y llegar la victoria
5861113 porque es un gran compa ero una gran amigo y aprovecho para mandarle un saludo es especial porque le aprend mucho as como a talavera a michel pero siempre enfrentar a un gran arquero como oswaldo es especial
5861114 por eso tenemos que aprovechar la que se viene l s bado es una bonita oportunidad para ganar sumar de tres y hacer que en nuestra casa se queden todos los puntos

5861120 on future chaos simenons guest vocalists are as inspired as ever
5861121 el estadio va a estar lleno un rival que para nosotros siempre ha sido complicado pero tenemos que ganar s o s muchas veces dicen que el que juega mejor tiene m s oportunidad de ganar pero ma ana si se juega bien excelente pero si no se juega bien y se gana tiene que ser la primicia porque con resultados se puede trabajar mejor
5861122 la gente que viene de europa como trabajan ellos all la selecci n va a volver a un 4 4 2 como jugaba hugo es lo m s factible toda la gente en europa juega 4 4 2 entonces van a jugar en sus posiciones que juegan all no ser jugar al vapor los jugadores son muy capaces no creo que sea un obst culo para que el d a de ma ana no hagamos un buen partido
5861123 no me gusta hablar y menos cuando est s fuera pero si bien no era para ganar el partido tampoco era para perderlo lamentablemente el que marca los goles se lleva los tres puntos morelia aprovech un descuido que tuvimos y se marc la historia del partido ni modo ahora hay que reivindicarnos en casa y buscar los tres puntos estamos en la punta del grupo
5861124 por estad stica los rbitros se equivocan cuatro veces en un partido para mala fortuna las dos primeras fueron en contra del puebla se alando una falta y una expulsi n que no existieron eso al equipo le afect porque yo iba a hacer un cambio para tener m s profundidad porque las llegadas de toluca fueron circunstanciales y estoy seguro que el marcador lo remont bamos sin problemas
5861125 tuvimos mayor entendimiento y llegada mientras ramos once contra once est bamos jugando muy bonito
5861126 los jugadores siguen creyendo en m y seguimos con la misma idea no tenemos los suficientes puntos porque en los dos primeros partidos que tuvimos imponderables a nuestro favor no los aprovechamos pero estamos unidos y seguiremos con la misma idea hasta obtener la victoria
5861127 cometieron una tonter a porque era de los pocos equipos que estaba atacando con seis y hab a logrado una manera de jugar obviamente son el avocado a descender pero s lo est n jugando con tres extranjeros y lamentablemente se contin a la tradici n del futbol mexicano de no darle continuidad a las cosas
5861128 en el futbol en m xico no hay mucho tiempo para conjuntarse as que tienen que empezar a jugar mejor y dar resultados
5861129 tengo mucha alegr a porque nuevamente fui tomado en cuenta por el t cnico quien durante todo este tiempo que no jugu me brind todo su apoyo y sobre todo siempre me dio consejos para seguir fortaleci ndome y responder de gran manera cuando me requiera ahora que en el partido del s bado pasado tuve la fortuna de iniciar contra el am rica el profe me dijo que hice bien las cosas y que voy por buen camino para el funcionamiento que pretende lo cual me da mucha confianza para seguir aprovechando al m ximo estas oportunidades que tendr de aqu en adelante
5861130 ahora que se est n dando las cosas la responsabilidad es mayor ante todo pues uno como jugador debe estar mentalizado en responder de la mejor manera por que al final de cuentas el t cnico es el que decide si tienes continuidad en el cuadro titular y en la primera divisi n que es para lo que uno trabaja
5861131 la relaci n que tengo con todos mis compa eros es muy buena tanto en los entrenamiento como fuera de la cancha son grandes amigos a tal grado que en estos momentos que no se ha podido ganar me apoyan para que siga adelante y sobrellevar esta mala situaci n que atraviesa el equipo tenemos mucha fe en que muy pronto nos reencontraremos con los buenos resultados y colocarnos en los primeros lugares
5861132 son errores que pasan y desafortunadamente esa jugada termin por privarnos de la victoria sin embargo estoy tranquilo por que la mayor a de mis compa eros me dijo que apenas es el comienzo de muchas oportunidades que tendr y que conforme pase el tiempo las concretar si observamos la jugada fue una pelota muy r pida en la que por el mismo efecto que tra a no pude meterla de primera intenci n
5861133 un equipo muy peligroso que se ha armado bien muy equilibrado que contragolpea con mucha velocidad con robert de pinho con gente de calidad como el
5861134 eso dice la estad stica pero no dejan de ser n meros en cada partido se presentan circunstancias diferentes lo m s importante es tratar nosotros de estar concentrados de aplicar lo que se trabaja en la semana
5861135 no es f cil pero hay la calidad bas ndonos en eso y de que estamos en casa tenemos que sacar el resultado no va a ser f cil hay que trabajar el partido las distancias se han acortado nos conocemos los dos equipos mucho pero hay que ganar
5861136 de que sea la mejor selecci n hay que demostrarlo en la cancha parece ser que s porque viene la gente que est trabajando en europa y que han hecho buen papel pero como equipo y como selecci n hay que demostrarlo
5861137 es un problema complejo no nada m s son los deportistas que ahora no han entregado buenas cuentas es un problema de ra z el deporte federado las organizaciones est n quedando a deber falta un ajuste desde las bases yo veo que al deportista mexicano le brindamos el apoyo cuando ya gan una medalla al que da resultados lo queremos apoyar no hay que apoyar a todos desde las bases y ahora estamos pagando el que no ha existido un apoyo
5861138 t ves ahora el fen meno de michael phelps desde los ocho a os tiene un apoyo de las universidades donde est trabajando todo lo que tiene alrededor de l es para dar resultados yo creo que en m xico estamos a mucha distancia de eso
5861139 nunca he tratado de pelear ni nada pero yo siempre he dicho que los naturalizados s te quitan un derecho de estar ah a un mexicano pero es decisi n del t cnico hay que trabajar y demostrar dentro de la cancha
5861140 no me desilusiona es un compromiso para trabajar mejor redoblar esfuerzos para en cualquier momento obtener un llamado
5861141 yo creo que m xico va a ganar tiene que ganar tiene buenos jugadores todos est n bien preparados y van a hacer un buen trabajo
5861142 ahora me toca de este lado vamos a tratar de no dejarlos y de ponerle intensidad de tratar de ganarle a fuerza siempre motiva porque te enfrentas a amigos a la instituci n donde estuviste muchos a os te motiva y puedes dar un extra
5861143 ha sido por fortuna por errores falta de desconcentraci n pero conocemos a pachuca que en cualquier momento puede levantarse y hay que salir con todo para que no le suceda contra nosotros
5861144 esta semana se va a evaluar no tiene molestias va bien est en trabajo f sico y esperemos que sea esta semana pablo barrera va bien aunque como sabemos su problema es cuesti n de tiempo david toledo sigue con su problema del tend n no estar a para esta semana

5861152 livermore is really going in the right direction bringing restaurants and culture to downtown owner mario schiopu says
5861153 but were some of the first on the trail the pioneers blazed
5861154 theres been a steady increase in acres and a lot for wild cropping such as mushroom picking on blm and forest service land that can show they havent been sprayed for three years theres also been a steady increase in income last year was greater than 10 million and we expect this year to be somewhat higher
5861155 initially all of my organic produce vendors were certified by the feds then one day the state came in and told me i would have to pull everything from my organic section that wasnt also certified by the state of idaho
5861156 i had to contact all of my vendors and have them fill out the paperwork to be organic certified in idaho
5861157 over the last three years the demand for organic produce meats grains has increased about 20 percent
5861158 both of us are passionate about home gardens that are increasingly organic last year i started a community garden
5861159 conventional farming was easier because of machinery but which in row cultivation tended
5861160 eventually well plant closer for water insect control and deeper growth
5861161 we were no 164 to be organically certified about 1995
5861162 until last year we grew and sold to the restaurants and farm markets last year we retired we still sell at farm markets
5861163 but only lettuce beets early greens that kind of thing
5861164 so we started using herbs from snohomish near seattle in the late 1980s there wasnt much in the way of herbs at the time in idaho
5861165 we had to do a lot of educating against produce houses who had volume and ease of delivery we couldnt do that but a plus for us was that we had an organic product and negligible spoilage factor
5861166 im so pleased that wills magnificent voice has returned to its vibrancy and telethon audiences will be treated to his extraordinary talent
5861167 my familys support faith in god and doctors who knew how to fight my illness brought me back from some very tough times
5861168 performing at the telethon is the least i can do to show my appreciation
5861169 whether it is being done by trained black belts or consultants
5861170 webbs breakthrough ideas show how marketing selling and servicing functions can be approached as a process with input and outputs causes and effects i highly recommend this book to all senior executives whether they are aiming for better forecasting better market share higher margins or reduced cost of sales it will completely change the way you view sales and marketing and help you get a handle on sales process improvement
5861171 hats off to mike webb for tackling this challenging subject improving sales and marketing is like training your cat to come when you call it its an interesting thing to think about but full of pitfalls to the uninitiated mike however is very initiated and this book does a good job of showing you how quantitative methods can apply to a traditionally hard to manage business its not that sales forces dont have metrics you could argue that they have the ultimate metric did we make the sale like your cat these groups seem to have a mind of their own and the cause and effect of the activities that go into making the sale arent usually methodically examined and improved mike shows you how to do that with style
5861172 think about it marketing and sales can easily represent nearly half of your companys annual expenses this expense is far from being optimized when 9 out 10 leads are typically discarded early in the sales cycle companies that do not apply a systematic and truly accountable approach to blending marketing and sales will undoubtedly struggle to survive in this increasingly competitive business climate this book concisely applies practical six sigma methods to help companies boost customer value and realize greater roi out of their marketing and sales investment if you know theres room for improvement between your marketing and sales teams i highly recommend you leverage this book as a key competitive advantage
5861173 this book is essential reading for anyone in sales and marketing mike webbs unique perspective is captured in this excellent roadmap on how to organize measure and lead both marketers and sellers to greater success
5861174 michael webb has once again demonstrated his clear and systematic thinking about delivering value to customers in this must read book sales and marketing the six sigma way in this book mike provides tools to help measure your sales processes in terms important to your customers then you can continuously improve your processes of finding winning and keeping customers
5861175 sales and marketing organizations have historically been slow in adopting the benefits of six sigma for a variety of reasons especially because of the effort required to
5861176 michael webb has a very incisive clear headed approach to untangling complex sales problems sales and marketing the six sigma way breaks the sales funnel into its component parts and systematically identifies bottlenecks and disconnects that waste your time and resources selling might have been done by the seat of the pants in the 20th century but that isnt going to work now those who miss this shift will find themselves further and further behind quotas and locked in a corporate pressure cooker but those who recognize and act will discover that the current business climate can be enormously rewarding and profitable this book is not a sales rah rah session it takes enormously successful methods from manufacturing and applies them to the toughest job in your company getting orders from customers i wholeheartedly recommend michael and his innovative methods
5861177 michael webb brings true understanding to sales and marketing through process thinking if you want a harmonious relationship between sales marketing and customer service that will drive customer value you need to read this book
5861178 if you dont know what you have done to succeed or what has caused you to fail you are leaving your destiny to chance in our experience when you understand and remove obstacles to your customers achieving their objectives you create customer value by helping them succeed in addition putting your own processes under the microscope can reveal the whats inhibiting you from achieving your sales goals michael webbs straightforward approach to sales and marketing using the popular six sigma method is presented with a sense of humor and lots of examples well worth your time
5861179 if more books on the subject were as concise and fun to read as sales and marketing the six sigma way the business world would be a better place the book will provide sales and marketing executives with money making tools they can use daily
5861180 applying six sigma to sales and marketing initially i was skeptical but after reading this book im a believer applying these principles correctly will help sales managers solve many of the challenges they face every day in their quest to improve sales performance
5861181 it isnt often that i can recommend a six sigma book because reducing defects tends to be product focused and internally oriented this book is not only different but better than any other six sigma book ive ever seen because it actually shows how to use it to increase the value of your relationships and experiences with your customers this is the way six sigma should be done
5861182 the name of the game is not to design the sales process around ourselves but to create customer value sales and marketing the six sigma way is relevant to all executives who are looking to deliver maximum results internally and externally
5861183 does it make sense for sales account managers to be compensated on net promoter scores for their accounts
5861184 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
5861185 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5861186 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
5861187 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5861188 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5861189 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful
5861190 this is insulting to us women and it harms the countrys image since were increasingly becoming a country of destination for tourists whose sole purpose is to have sex with our women
5861191 we take this issue very seriously we are pushing for legislation to forbid sex tourists from entering the country we are sick of men looking at us like pieces of meat
5861192 ukraine has a competitive advantage simply put our women are the best in the world
5861193 what ukraine needs to do to improve its image tainted by corruption sex tourism and other problems is to conduct a positive image campaign with systemic consistent and coordinated support from the top
5861194 theres a definite correlation between the new visa free regime and visitors to my club as is true in other places in kyiv such as arena and avalon
5861195 the growing amount of sex tourists entering ukraine has not escaped us but it is very difficult to measure their numbers
5861196 most women i spoke with are ashamed and do this out of poverty but some also do it out of material desire
5861197 they see luxury cars and houses and they want it now so they either compete for sugar daddies or willingly sell themselves
5861198 the girls here are tall and slim and getting them into bed is easy moreover they are fun to party with
5861199 morals are not instilled at the state operated orphanages when i speak to the older girls at these institutions all they talk about are cigarettes cars and so on without realizing how much they cost or how much they have to work to purchase them
5861200 we are developing an action plan leading to the 2012 cup we are a fast growing organization with a strong network and so well build on this to hang social billboards on city life which will feature photo sessions with famous people and partner with other organizations doing similar things to build a strong coalition
5861201 climbing these trees requires skill and training it is risky and laborious the climbers usually swung from one tree to another pluck the fruits
5861202 in karnataka one has to go hunting for a climber and bring him in a taxi to the farm as they are in great demand they charge rs 400 500 per day which farmers find difficult to pay as they do not earn much
5861203 women are being taught the skill but it is too risky for them we should have some semi mechanised contraption to take the climbers up the tree
5861204 anyone care to take a shot at explaining this data and how its consistent with libertarianism
5861205 we wanted to do some limitation of smoking and well well just model it after omaha
5861206 we had a lady that filed a suit against us and since the supreme court ruled the way they did with omaha we thought we probably ought to do something
5861207 we just dont want to spend money defending something that goes away in a few months
5861208 the bar business is down about 46 percent from last year at this time
5861209 weve had to layoff workers and cut hours so well just have to wait and see what the fall will bring us
5861210 he came into the sheriffs office said he wanted to talk to an officer one of the deputys came out to talk to him and he told the officer he had committed a murder in council bluffs
5861211 if we have somebody that has a steep backyard and they want to grow big blue stem on it because it keeps down erosion they should be able to do that but it would be above 10 inches
5861212 when you have a fearful dog youre increasing the possibility you have a more difficult to handle dog the fact that its going to be muzzled its going have the ability to be limited its not going to be able to defend itself
5861213 i was out there to be with all of my friends
5861214 i wanted to go out and have fun and see where it would take me
5861215 at first it started off kind of shaky i mean i had no clue
5861216 i didnt want any part of it at all it took me until my sophomore or junior year until i really started taking it seriously
5861217 throughout his first couple of years doug learned the game of football and developed into a kid who as sophomore started seeing a lot of time on both sides of the ball for us
5861218 you really saw the upswing once he grew into his body he physically and mentally matured and by the time he was a senior he was an impact player on both sides of the football for us
5861219 i tried to mirror everything that simeon did when it came to football
5861220 he is hands down the hardest worker of possibly anybody in the nfl hes there two hours before everybody and leaves two hours after everybody
5861221 once i started taking it seriously i saw that i just had to work
5861222 it didnt really fall into place early because i was kind of late bloomer i knew i was a little behind so i went to junior college and kept that work mentality
5861223 i had hoped that somebody wouldve taken a chance on him i think he is showing now that a lot of people made mistakes especially a lot of people around his hometown
5861224 i wanted to work as hard as i needed to to get that division i scholarship in a bcs conference
5861225 the one thing that my dad has instilled in me more than anything is to never be satisfied with where you are
5861226 be happy with who you are be proud of who you are but never be satisfied you can always improve on something
5861227 we are expecting great things and an exciting competitive season
5861228 we look to set a new tone for this team and the program
5861229 the big 12 is going to be tough and it is every year
5861230 it is a tough schedule across the board we look to be competitive and definitely want to be in the top half
5861231 the coaches wont accept anything less than the best from us and are pushing us every day
5861232 theyre great and we are getting a lot better very quickly
5861233 we are looking to play with more urgency and score more and be a more attacking team
5861234 at the same time we dont want to let more goals in
5861235 the coaches have pushed us really hard and make us want to play hard
5861236 we are excited to get things going and weve been practicing really well
5861237 fans will see a little different team out there this season but were still going to be a team that plays good defense and passes well
5861238 anytime you lose players of that caliber its tough but other teams around the country are dealing with the same issue
5861239 i think what youll see is a more balanced team and i know from playing those balanced teams that it is tough to defend
5861240 we brought in a really nice freshman class all of them are probably going to be able to contribute and i feel really good about where we are headed as a team
5861241 i feel like each year we are getting more athletic and each year the freshman are a little bit more ready to play when they get here
5861242 it started this spring and we really began to assume the leadership role at that time
5861243 everyone on the team needs to step up including myself but it comes down to everyone taking on a bigger role if we want to continue to build on what we have started
5861244 the age of star formation is drawing to a close
5861245 its not suddenly going to get very dark but its been getting dimmer over the last few thousand million years and that will continue
5861246 stars are formed in galaxies and there was a peak in the rate at which galaxies formed and that time has passed and been and gone
5861247 we live in an accelerating universe now and so as time goes on the density of galaxies is going to thin out
5861248 as far as we know the universe as it is now is going to expand for ever so ultimately it must do something like that
5861249 what we do is look at the spectra of light that comes out of the galaxies and try to decode it to work out when the stars were formed
5861250 the milky way has a fair amount of gas still in it so it is still showing signs of star formation now
5861251 its certainly going to be one of the later ones to carry on shining
5861252 ian are you a theistic evolutionist if so what do you base the age of the earth on if not how old do you say the age of the earth is
5861253 the reason i ask is you make references to an old earth
5861254 actually genesis 20 is rather interesting abraham lied to abimelech tricking him into thinking that sarah was his sister because he feared for his life if it was known that she was his wife lucky for abimelech god warned him before he touched sarah the pharaoh of whom abraham had also earlier played the same trick was not so lucky despite his kindness to abraham the pharaoh was punished by god with terrible diseases all because unknown to him he had fallen innocent victim to abrahams deceit i am unsure of what the moral lesson is here
5861255 your claim that the reason why god changed his mind regarding incest can only ultimately be known by god is the argument of last resort for the christian when reason fails and when we get to this stage there is little point for the atheist to take the debate any further ian you must be disappointed when you are required to use to the god only knows argument
5861256 as a secularist who does not draw his moral code from the bible i cannot condone incest my reading of the bible shows me that not only at one point in history was incest encouraged by god it was actually compulsory
5861257 isnt it wonderful that you are so much more intelligent than they are because you know god isnt it wonderful that you know more than the mighty professor richard dawkins a passionately atheist zoologist who put electrodes on his head to feel the kind of religious experience that you claimed to have only he didnt have them isnt it wonderful that you are so much smarter than all of those great men put together
5861258 and how do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul in the process
5861259 is that the subject begs the question of what or who made the gods of whom the biblical god is but one of thousands invented by man
5861260 your correspondent david balchin proposes that science explains how things work and god explains why things are if he is correct can he please explain scientifically how god works for example how did god come to exist
5861261 ironically the picture of the universe bequeathed to us by the most advanced twentieth century science is closer in spirit to the vision presented in the book of genesis than anything offered by science since copernicus
5861262 is a consequence of accepting the authority of the word of god as an infallible revelation from our omniscient creator
5861263 ian you are an enigma as an investigative journalist you apply reasoned objective discipline into most things bar the supernatural realm of your christian faith
5861264 the word atheism sounds negative let me call it rationalism it is a rational view of the world where you stand up proudly in your humanity you look life straight in the face you look the universe straight in the face you do your level best to understand it to understand why you exist what the universe is about you recognise that when you die thats it and therefore life is very very precious and you devote your life to making the world a better place to leading a good life so when you die you can say to yourself i have led a good life now that seems to me to be a worthwhile goal to put in place of the medieval superstition which is religion belief in god doesnt have to be a bad thing but i think its a very demeaning thing to the human mind to believe in a falsehood especially as the truth about the universe is so immensely exciting at the beginning of the 21st century we humans have a real opportunity to learn about and understand the universe the world humanity life in a way that none of our predecessors have ever come close to that is a huge privilege and belief in god simply gets in the way of that religion is an irrelevance its a distraction its a rather boring parochial falsehood that stands in the way of the glories of true understanding
5861265 i want to look after poor people and their children
5861266 how much they save is not important its the habit of saving and not spending their money on sniffing glue smoking watching the same movie again and again
5861267 the children are able to deposit and save money if they keep the money on them itll get stolen or theyll blow it or get addicted to drugs
5861268 im saving up because i want to get educated this money will go to good use
5861269 there are about 70 000 widows in afghanistan and sewa has this massive challenge of doing economic rehabilitation of these women i think we will be working for over three to five years time on setting up vocational training centres on giving market access and market linkages andhen giving economic security and livelihood security to over 15 000 women and solving their houseless problem in the coming three years time
5861270 we will learn this program for other people especially those who want to survive in afghanistan but are poor women they cant be on their own to survive and by themselves livelihood they cant make arrangements for their members of their family for their children and for their country for their people
5861271 we can do some service for the people of our country we can see or consider this program as a good brotherly relationship between the both people of afghanistan and india it can bring more relationship between the two countries

5861279 and id like to start with a victory to avoid breaking the world cup streak
5861280 well try to win the world cup again but it wont be easy
5861281 when i started my national team adventure four years ago there was a team and a group to build from nothing
5861282 we achieved this and today we are starting again from there this is a team of moral and technical quality that can still give a lot
5861283 what counts more than the formation is the philosophy the desire of great players to put themselves at the service of the team
5861284 n o foi t o mau quanto pensava que seria
5861285 acho que tudo ir bem n s somos mulheres maduras e profissionais
5861286 toda a equipe de grava o estava na expectativa para ver o que aconteceria
5861287 our attempt to live morally as though there were no god might be the final test of faith
5861288 the devil can quote the bible to cite his purpose
5861289 for i am a jealous god punishing the children to the 3rd and 4th generation of those who hate me do i note a touch of petulance here i thought that a failing peculiar to mortals
5861290 fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their father s each is to die for his own sin as an authoritative position very confusing
5861291 bound only by birth and death life is both the ultimate mystery and the process of solving it life is a dance a leap into the unknown after you jump and before you land is god that state of being when everything comes together nothing is missing and it s all vibrating and electric life is an excuse for ecstacy anyway you can get it in bed in church in a song personally i was born to die dancing
5861292 the land is defiled therefore i visit the punishment of its iniquity upon it and the land vomits out its inhabitants
5861293 given the cancerous state of the society into which they were being born they had no chance to avoid its fatal pollution
5861294 your declaration that god is at liberty to inflict any level of suffering and evil for whatever reason simply because he is god is frightening i could never respect nor want any association with a god who inflicts cruelty and death simply because he can because he is god i could never respect a god who exhibits the attributes of evil i detest in humans
5861295 so what happened to free will why deny these children the opportunity to exercise free will and choose a moral life free from their parents sin no god saw fit to take their young lives and thats that
5861296 perhaps as any genuinely objective reading of the ot shows the cultures those kids were being born into were so utterly depraved and autocratic that there was no chance of them freeing themselves from
5861297 as for the disposability of cultures that represent spiritual cancers this type of thinking scares me ie the absolute right of good to confront evil
5861298 it is not the secular world we need to fear it is those running around in the name of god as i type this on the other side of the world god is telling muslims to take the lives of the infidel in response the infidel does gods work by striking back god can be found on both sides of the equation and they all end up dead these are gods people in gods fight not secularists and you ask where we atheists get our moral code from
5861299 i will not abandon my rational faculties or moral code for any reason for anybody not even god if i do what do i have left
5861300 a good father is one who explains to his son the reasons for actions if he observes these actions to be causing his son distress a father would not ignore his sons anguish simply because he knows better unless perhaps his actions were wrong in the first place
5861301 you talk of a culture so utterly depraved and autocratic that there was no chance of freeing children from
5861302 so why then should those without free will be given an automatic ride to eternal bliss whereas those who have it risk eternal suffering all because they have been lumbered a free will which is of questionable use anyway as it operates from an unproven factual matrix hardly equitable whose palms do we need to grease to get the get out of hell free card given to those lucky enough to miss out on free will
5861303 you say evil by definition is the antithesis of good evil is simply a behaviour evil is the initiation of force by someone against someone else without their consent the greater the use of force the greater the evil
5861304 some men commit evil and invoke a god as their reason some men dont those men who do not invoke god often know that their actions are wrong those who invoke god often dont it is latter ones that scare me the most
5861305 it is not a case of who is the better judge of morality rather it is just that your gods morality is not mine as said earlier i will not abandon my morality for anyone
5861306 i will not subrogate the reality and beauty of this natural world for an supernatural afterworld that probably doesnt exist you ask me to give god the same benefit of the doubt that i give darwin no darwin was real your god is not darwin lived for this world you live for the next
5861307 you ask whether a cancer surgeon using maximum force against cancer either by cutting or zapping it out is evil the answer is simple as per my definition of evil if the surgeon has the consent of the person with cancer then it is not evil if the surgeon operates without consent then his actions are evil
5861308 finally you talk of a god so intricately concerned with our wellbeing that he knows things about us that even were not prepared to concede to ourselves this intricate concern reminds me of a story i heard a couple of years ago a young christian missionary was cycling around south america while peddling away a vital piece of gearing on his bike failed being many miles from civilisation and not having a replacement part he feared that his evangelical journey may be at an end the nearest village did not have any bikes let alone a bike shop yet to his amazement the local shop stocked a replacement part it was the only bike part the shop stocked and the owner could not recall why or how he had come to have this piece in stock the young missionary his faith renewed knew why god had specifically placed it their for him this story however is one for the believers the same week on the other side of the world 5 000 rwandans were hacked to death with machetes
5861309 i couldnt hold someones hand to a fire for a moment not an instant how could a loving god just because you dont obey him and do what he wants torture you forever not allowing you to die but to continue in that pain for eternity there is no criminal who would do this
5861310 i am convinced that i am acting as the agent of our creator by fighting off the jews i am doing the lords work
5861311 ie it would always be an act of evil if the patient had explicitly requested the surgery not take place
5861312 on christians feeling the intervention of god in their lives in some facet or other all impacts on their lives can happily be ascribed to god if beneficial then god has deliberately intervened for their good if detrimental then god moves in mysterious ways we cannot understand his moral code and all will be revealed in the hereafter either way god was involved and their faith remains intact the atheist is on a hiding to nothing when trying to debate this further our view however is simple sometimes things go well others times sh t happens
5861313 personally i would have preferred divine intervention to have seen mohamed atta stray into the path of an oncoming bus some months previous but i know me a dolphin and the theory of relativity thing
5861314 you also state that god was with the victims as they passed from this life to the next
5861315 i couldnt hold someones hand to a fire for a moment
5861316 finally a quote from another book from an author you mentioned in your last post
5861317 looking back it was inevitable often i think i was wiser at twelve than at twenty now the fear is a memory smiles come more easily and almost to my astonishment the sky remains blue the sun shines breath is sweet love still gives me wings and life is as beautiful and meaningless as a flower
5861318 but that doesnt really mean anything what religion are you
5861319 do you think that sometimes you pay too much attention to christianity i mean its easy to take these things too seriously there are much more important things in the world to talk about
5861320 i saw a medley of haphazard facts fall into line and order
5861321 but it s true i said to myself it s very beautiful and it s true
5861322 it is by a process of differentiation that we separate ourselves one from another this is an artificial delusion of consciousness and creates a kind of prison for ourselves we see this in religious differences formation of sects and special interest groups racial and pschological prejudice and class distinction
5861323 but if everyone would see the light and recognise that our path is the one true way then we would all be one
5861324 was a little distracted by all the preparations that had to be made
5861325 you are worried and upset by many things but only one thing is needed
5861326 if you knew the gift of god and who it is that asks you for a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
5861327 my father is always at his work to this very day and i too am always working

5861334 gran cantidad de mujeres suspende la toma de anticonceptivos inmediatamente despu s de pelearse con su pareja quedando sin protecci n segura frente a un eventual reencuentro sexual y asumiendo el riesgo de quedar embarazadas sin planificarlo
5861335 las estad sticas dicen que cerca del 10 de las mujeres quedar n embarazadas en una nica relaci n sin protecci n adecuada en argentina seg n nuestros relevamientos se ve sobre todo en j venes
5861336 muchas mujeres deciden apresuradamente suspender las p ldoras como una manera de mostrar a los dem s y asegurarse a s mismas y a su pareja que no van a volver a tener relaciones con l pero en la mayor a de los casos se repite imprevistamente un encuentro sexual ya sin pastillas y muchas veces sin preservativo porque ese no era el m todo habitual que utilizaban
5861337 ni la mujer ni el var n deber an dejar la decisi n del cuidado anticonceptivo a merced de los conflictos sentimentales que puedan surgir entre ellos durante la relaci n durante el transcurso de un desenga o y en las idas y vueltas que a veces supone una separaci n el cuidado deber a acentuarse
5861338 por lo general las relaciones afectivas entre ellos suelen ser muy intensas desde lo emocional pero muy l biles y poco duraderas por lo tanto el riesgo de exponerse a relaciones sexuales sin buena protecci n a embarazos no planificados y a enfermedades de transmisi n sexual es aun mayor
5861339 algunas mujeres creen que s lo pueden tomar pastillas cuando tienen relaciones sexuales y no es as
5861340 no conviene dejarlas ni bien uno se pelea no hay apuro ni hay contraindicaciones desde el punto de vista m dico es mejor esperar a ver c mo evoluciona esa ruptura

5861360 fiction does not spring into the world full grown like athena it is the process of writing and rewriting that makes a fiction original and profound one cannot judge in advance whether or not the idea of the story is worthwhile because until one has finished writing the story one does not know for sure what the idea is and one cannot judge the style of a story on the basis of a first draft because in a first draft the style of the finished story does not yet exist
5861361 if you have taken the time to learn to write beautiful rock firm sentences if you have mastered evocation of the vivid and continuous dream if you are generous enough in your personal character to treat imaginary characters and readers fairly if you have held on to your childhood virtues and have not settled for literary standards much lower than those of the fiction you admire then the novel you write will eventually be after the necessary labor of repeated revision a novel to be proud of one that almost certainly someone sooner or later will be glad to publish

5861412 its like what i did in my last show people loved it
5861413 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive
5861414 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5861415 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
5861416 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
5861417 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5861418 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5861419 piri is an outstanding rugby player and to have him play in new zealand is fantastic for us
5861420 he has represented new zealand at the highest level and he has been an influential player for his province and franchise as well
5861421 piri has a major role to play with both the hurricanes and the wellington lions
5861422 at the age of just 24 he has already earned 56 caps for the hurricanes 41 for wellington and 22 for the all blacks
5861423 the main thing for england is that you need players who can play under pressure who can do it under the spotlight because you know theres a lot of criticism waiting out there from the public if you fail
5861424 theres a lot of pressure when playing for your country and this has perhaps weighed down too heavily on some players
5861425 we need to free them of that so they can play naturally without fear
5861426 a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5861427 the positive aspect is that theyre prepared to unwind that
5861428 less restrictive monetary conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5861429 if anyone were to find me in a business suit and flip flops in midtown i hope that they would hit me with a taxi because someone has taken over my brain
5861430 we do see throughout the nation this movement for locally produced food
5861431 this is a small way for the city to make it less onerous for people who want to produce their own eggs and to keep hens and rabbits
5861432 if everybody kept three chickens for every person in the household we would change the nature of this country
5861433 i dont know the noise level of 16 hens or one rooster i dont know the health effects if there will be flies and other insects
5861434 does that person coming from san francisco or another state want to have these animals next door and then do i have to go to my police department to enforce the code and how much time is that going to take
5861435 they were colorful a little bit of residual agricultural texture
5861436 there were some problems i dont know if the kids were chasing them or they were chasing the kids but we dont want kids hurt
5861437 we are not talking about commercial endeavors in backyards but being able to have your own homegrown eggs and it seems in keeping with some of the goals we have established in society
5861438 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
5861439 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
5861440 help from security researchers in the form of usable bug reports and responsible timelines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible
5861441 comptia pdi is exactly what the printing and document imaging industry has asked us for
5861442 the programs we will offer at recharger world expo will address the components of the certification and share proven ways that comptia pdi has helped organizations lower their costs
5861443 weve re engineered the common flashlight into a more powerful tool that will help give professionals and do it yourselfers the vision to do their jobs better
5861444 the difference isnt subtle and we named it daylite for a reason its like bringing a beam of daylight to the job its powered by duracell batteries but its another example of how the company is bringing more than battery innovation to the market
5861445 when the shelling started the georgian troops would wait until the south ossetians would retreat to their basements as they have done for years during similar attacks and then the georgian army regulars would throw grenades into the basements of the houses or open fire on the civilians crowded inside their tiny basements
5861446 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5861447 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5861448 the all golds hold a special place not just in our games history but also in new zealand sporting history as a whole
5861449 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in
5861450 the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pending requirements
5861451 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5861452 its going to be like that for the next three too
5861453 were trying to play with a chip on our shoulder we go out every night and try to get better
5861454 i expect them to play hard to play tough theyre not intimidated they wont back down theyll come ready to play
5861455 they run a continuity offence theyre very proficient at it they run hard cuts set hard picks theyre very smart it will be a different ball game
5861456 we know argentina are a very experienced team we hope to have a little revenge because they knocked us out in the last olympic tournament in greece in our home

5861463 back when i was expecting most nursing clothes available in singapore were from imported united states and europeanlabels whose sizing was incompatible with the asian fit
5861464 their styling and fabrication was also not suited to the tropical climate
5861465 our garments and their manufacturing processes fulfilled the condition for a preferential origin status
5861466 as an export business it is important that we keep abreast of international trade developments
5861467 ie singapore also organises seminars on new market developments which we will attend depending on market relevance
5861468 the variety of products that have been successfully exported under singapores network of ftas reiterates the relevance and importance of ftas as a tool for businesses to gain export competitiveness
5861469 it was unbelievable you just have to look at the scoreboard
5861470 travel beyond time and beyond location into my gush katif
5861471 super great grandmother of jewish gaza passes away in memory of sylvia mandelbaum
5861472 a search for politicians who regret the 2005 disengagement from gush katif and northern samaria has turned up only modest success
5861473 i did not find any who were involved in the actual decision making process who have expressed regret and say openly that they made a mistake nor have there been too many who said they wouldnt do it again
5861474 there is unrest in the forest there is trouble with the trees for the maples want more sunlight and the oaks ignore their pleas
5861475 its a fight on a high level im in my element the sword is out i need to go into battle im more than motivated im all fired up
5861476 finally its time im impatient i want to find players to relaunch the machine
5861477 our efforts to reach out to singapore based companies and encourage their utilisation of ftas have been very rewarding
5861478 it gives us great satisfaction when businesses are able to enter new markets successfully and gain recognition among overseas consumers through leveraging of singapores ftas
5861479 machines can work 24 hours a day while human labour can only have eight hour shifts hence my productivity and efficiency are improved
5861480 my production workers dropped from 147 to 21 the labour cost savings arising from this was enough to pay the instalments owed to banks
5861481 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports

5861483 the yamit towns in northern sinai which were destroyed in 1982 in accordance with the peace treaty with egypt have been forgotten we dont want the same to happen with gush katif

5861489 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5861490 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5861491 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5861492 de russische federatie zal het resolutievoorstel dat frankrijk vandaag voorstelde niet steunen

5861499 im not so great what about like the doctors without border or those people who save orphans
5861500 female porn stars are paid big money to simulate scenes of rape sexual violation and degradation for the purposes of male sexual arousal and gratification
5861501 it is underpinned by attitudes and messages many of which are fuelled and normalised by the hard core porn industry

5861503 it leads students to internalize the structures of the piece being imitated
5861504 what has been done by others so theres profound originality
5861505 what freewriting does best is loosen the inhibitions of the inexperienced writer
5861506 when faced with a writing assignment many students are troubled not by the lack of subject or topic but by a seeming lack of anything important or coherent to write about it
5861507 have a much better idea of where they need to go to look up information they do not have at hand
5861508 i already wrote my essay and im not going to re write it
5861509 grading on a curve and grading their paper based on others in the class how can i make sure i am grading objectively
5861510 ok even i would like to take class with a professor who takes almost two months to pick up a two page paper
5861511 it has help them out in their writing classes at the university
5861512 the purpose of the writing assignments is to demonstrate understanding of the assignment in ways that the teacher reader already anticipates
5861513 every response to an assignment is an act of the student writer
5861514 teaching a writing course using literature is very different from teaching a literature course
5861515 limit your teaching of new material so that students can focus on applying what theyre learning to their writing
5861516 i want to be specific enough so that students understand the assignment itself but i also want to make sure that im not too specific so they can still be creative
5861517 the most global prompt possible and then to assess the resulting paper arbitrarily

5861520 in may two of the places we fly to were affected by natural calamities we have had to adjust our capacity expansion plans to some of these places and also to reduce flight frequency
5861521 over this olympics period weve also seen some softening in demand over to china for various reasons
5861522 china is a market thats going to grow from stride to stride and we are in it for the long haul we will be there to tap on the growth opportunities when the market turns around
5861523 i knew chen was special at the first sight of the girl her body structure seemed perfectly suited for weightlifting even then
5861524 we had lifters in the 105kg and 120kg and above weight categories at the world championships
5861525 if more of our weightlifters had competed they would have been very hopeful of winning but because of the limitation we couldnt
5861526 right now i only think about doing my job properly
5861527 what my mother thinks and says is really up to her as for marriage and children i am not thinking so far ahead
5861528 ive never heard of him qingquan before not even in the world championships in 2006 or 2007 this is the first time ive seen him
5861529 as a matter of fact im not a well disciplined person and i often devote a lot of time to electronic games
5861530 because of that im usually not under any great pressure
5861531 beauty and women weightlifters go hand in hand my belief is that being healthy is being beautiful remember that saying health leads the trend for fashion
5861532 diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggy whilst looking for a really big stick
5861533 i intend to be more vocal than i have been in the past and help ontarians fully understand the nature of our economic challenge
5861534 our unemployed ontarians get less funding than do unemployed canadians living anywhere else in the country and we get less money for health care than do canadians living anywhere else in the country
5861535 wed love to see the prime minister speak to that specifically and find a way to address it
5861536 i know there are some things that all the federal parties will want to do that will speak to ontarios needs on a short term basis
5861537 but my concern is really the long term what are we doing to do to address some of these issues that have been dragging on now for decades
5861538 im 50 and i remember going gopher hunting when i was eight years old and still there are thousands of people fathers and sons daughters and grandfathers that participate in it every year
5861539 i car pooled there with three friends to have a swim and i was stopped by a staff member who told me he believed i was conducting a class which i wasnt
5861540 a lady from canyonleigh whom i taught six months ago came into the pool and started using my program she does this once a week and she was as shocked to see me as i was her
5861541 we havent got official confirmation of the nature of his injury
5861542 this has allowed the team to go into the singles competition with a lot less pressure and i believe it will allow them to perform better they should be able to play to their fullest potential
5861543 we all believe we have a good chance in the singles
5861544 it sells magazines and products does it translate into greater interest and respect in womens sports and the answer is unequivocally it does not
5861545 the assumption is that sex sells the assumption is for womens sports to survive you have to attract the real fans which are male fans and you have to attract them with how pretty they are and how sexy they are
5861546 i love to be alone at the top its so cool and i will try to keep my position as long as possible
5861547 i have done campaigns for many companies being a model is a good way to earn money which i need to concentrate on my sport which is my real passion
5861548 my friend found on the internet the correct spelling of these words hello beijing and wrote it for me
5861549 i have no idea what the words will be my friend is keeping it a secret
5861550 im not sure which is more scary that hedgehog art exists or that you found it
5861551 one problem we have found at the nea is most people feel that businesses have not done anything about the environment it may not be true
5861552 businesses here are more conscious of the environment and part of its for pragmatic reasons if you consume what costs more its as basic as that
5861553 the approach for a small business should be no different from a household
5861554 just like managing a two man business or a sole proprietorship it should not be different from personal finance when it comes to a certain size your mindset should be no different from that of managing your own home
5861555 if you want change make it something easy for people to accept its like going ona diet if i say i will just have one meal a day it will be too difficult but if i cut 10 per cent of what i eat it will be manageable
5861556 critical review of its existing internal control procedures and systems and concluded that the incidents occurred because of failure in adhering to existing operating procedures
5861557 in what can only be described as an act of
5861558 i have been watching closely how our agreements are being fulfilled even the minor issues that we considered then were solved virtually the next day the next week after our meeting the belarusian side too has been acting in this manner
5861559 but today in our everyday relations in economy politics time has come and the situation pushes us to it including the conflict between georgia and south ossetia when russia had to defend its people pushes us to some complex actions within the framework of our union state i think the time of simple actions and decisions has gone we need to act more closely
5861560 that was a cool headed tranquil reaction which led to the establishment of peace in the region and for a long time i think everything was done calmly wisely and neatly
5861561 some issues of international life international consequences of georgias aggression against south ossetia issues pertaining to development of cooperation within the collective security treaty organisation csto
5861562 we need to discuss our nearest joint steps toward strengthening our strategic partnership
5861563 the two missions have recently developed constructive contacts the chiefs of the two missions meet regularly in the course of monitoring of the pre election period the experts of the two missions regularly exchange the results of the monitoring
5861564 the mission regards the establishment of a task group on the control over the observation of election legislation as an effort to create a favourable environment to conduct the election campaign
5861565 at present the cis long term observers are studying the formation procedures of election commissions the registration of initiative groups and the nomination of candidates to the house of representatives in general
5861566 if necessary we can accommodate 2 500 children every month starting october
5861567 an agreement on building a unified air defense system will be signed
5861568 the wisdom you showed in response to aggression from a neighboring state
5861569 the time for simple steps and solutions is over and we need to think how to act more effectively in this area
5861570 if this girl does not return to belarus then the chance of us seeing our daughter is over
5861571 kazyras return is the only chance we have of seeing our daughter
5861572 i came to petaluma to resolve the situation peacefully and in the best interest of the child
5861573 i want to ask her to please consider all the children that shes affecting
5861574 going back would be the most generous thing she could do in her life
5861575 why is the government so upset why is the government insisting on the return of a 16 year old girl with a visa whose grandmother has voiced her support of her continued stay
5861576 it would be a tragedy if the programs were to not continue but there are a lot of other factors that may be contributing to that decision beside tanyas decision not to return
5861577 we are looking forward to kazyras return to make things better to her and all to all the thousands of families
5861578 for 3 hours i and the head of hrodna branch of the union of poles in belarus myachyslau yaskevich are kept at the border and we cannot go to poland
5861579 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5861580 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5861581 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5861582 this nato which has come so far in a europe that is whole free and at peace is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5861583 the russian side supports the deployment of a considerable number of additional observers in the security zone
5861584 the russians should withdraw from georgia proper but this is open to interpretation
5861585 they took everything from cars to toilet paper and everything they didnt take they destroyed
5861586 we are not pulling troops out were pulling them back pull back this is the term we use
5861587 russias leaders are seriously considering supporting prime minister yulia tymoshenko in the presidential campaign once she fulfils the condition of adopting a passive position in the conflict with georgia
5861588 fully fledged work in the interests of the russian side
5861589 the public has a right to know how far politicians will go beyond the boundary where political battles end and the betrayal of national interests begins
5861590 let the management of the polish track and field athletic association run in the 4x400 metre hurdles relay final themselves
5861591 it was a group of perhaps 23 who appointed the olympic team representatives the coach jozef lisowski who is in charge of the relay race had a different idea the team should be composed of athletes who are healthy and in good physical shape but the old boys network and favouritism won over the coachs logic my question is what is mr lisowski supposed to be responsible for let the management of the polish track and field athletic association run in the 4x400 metre hurdles relay final themselves
5861592 would lose against hurdle runners even if he was doing a straight run
5861593 in the summer the fight for consumers is all about the resorts
5861594 we have not played like this for a long time
5861595 we played with a very good teamwork and did all together just like one person i am satisfied with what we played and will try our best in the semifinals no matter whoever we will meet
5861596 its not an easy way for us to win the game i have to thank to miao lijie who played great in the crucial time and lead the team for the victory
5861597 there is no return to civilization yet though the regime declares that

5861600 do not go among the gentiles or enter any town of the samaritans
5861601 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me 19therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit 20and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
5861602 suppose one of you has a friend and he goes to him at midnight and says friend lend me three loaves of bread 6because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me and i have nothing to set before him
5861603 if i can change and you can change everybody can change
5861604 che chi v al potere tanto si f i cazzi sua
5861605 they just picked up his body to take to the funeral home
5861606 you know what would be good right now a good cup of coffee
5861607 oh zshovanca so nice of you to drop in here come sit by me tell me everything
5861608 when i get to heaven youll have to take me all around show me the architecture
5861609 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5861610 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5861611 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5861612 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5861613 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5861614 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5861615 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5861616 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5861617 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5861618 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5861619 were going to determine whether or not he was a witness in any criminal investigation and determine whether or not the case is legitimate or needs to be reviewed
5861620 the harris county district attorneys office takes very seriously any allegations of improper criminal behavior by anybody wearing a badge
5861621 he confessed in his statement to narcotics officers that he had been involved in this activity
5861622 the vast majority of the men and women who wear a badge are there for the right reasons
5861623 theyre making use of this headstart to tie people into contracts
5861624 it isnt a question of price for me but its definitely cheaper than getting a hacked iphone
5861625 ill wait for starhub to offer the device because ive already signed up for its cable tv and broadband services i can see kids downloading streaming and watching videos on this device and dont see how viable it can be without an unlimited data bundle
5861626 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5861627 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5861628 this argument is not about shots to the moon or specific missions in space
5861629 this is a lot more about the economic side of the space program and the high tech high paying jobs that it creates
5861630 while im pleased the issue of space exploration is getting attention from our presidential candidates
5861631 sen mccains record of unwavering support for nasa speaks louder than obamas newfound appreciation for the space program
5861632 cultivate support for americas space program and increase much needed funding
5861633 america benefits when important issues like nasa are debated in a public forum
5861634 stephen fox knows more about houston than anyone knows about any other american megalopolis
5861635 in february the bbc brought together and interviewed in its london studios claudia greiner david little and me the greiners a german family were our next door neighbors in cali and played a key role in the kidnap and negotiations
5861636 the greiners now live near frankfurt david little was one of the two professional k amp r kidnap and ransom hostage negotiators who handled my case he is former scotland yard and now lives in the uk
5861637 knowing the correct password saying master master for instance isnt going to get you anywhere with me
5861638 please bring me through and make me finish this race faithfully loyally and completely surrendered to your will
5861639 and which of you having a servant plowing or tending sheep will say to him when he has come in from the field come at once and sit down to eat
5861640 13 when jesus came into the region of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying
5861641 some say john the baptist some elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
5861642 you are the christ the son of the living god
5861643 blessed are you simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
5861644 and i also say to you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades shall not prevail against it
5861645 and i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven

5861719 bien cela peut tre trait simplement en vous donnant une liste de livres lire mais je vais r sumer les grandes lignes pour que vous ayez des bases de d part notre histoire comme notre calendrier est divis e en deux parties avant marx et apr s marx par exemple
5861720 nous sommes en lan de marx 282 ce qui signifie 282 ann es apr s sa naissance vous aviez certainement au moins appris a l cole communiste avant davoir huit ans
5861721 mais cest la vieille division nos auteurs r cents divisent lhistoire en trois grandes p riodes lantiquit l ge sombre ndt ge sombre est le terme litt ral pour moyen ge en anglais et lhistoire moderne lantiquit est toute la p riode dont on ne sait pratiquement rien et qui a pr c d ce qui est ironiquement appel dans l ge sombre la r volution industrielle bien s r ce n tait pas une r volution du tout c tait une contre r volution l ge sombre commence avec la naissance du capitalisme il y quelques diff rences suivant les historiens quant lexacte ann e o l ge sombre a commenc certains la situent 95 av m ce qui tait lann e durant laquelle un bourgeois du nom dadam smith est n dautres la placent 42 av m qui est lann e dapparition dun livre de cet adam smith ce livre donna naissance et fournit un syst me labor dexcuses pour lid ologie capitaliste
5861722 on ne sait plus mais jy reviendrai dans un moment l ge sombre repr sente toute la p riode de la naissance du capitalisme jusqu son radication finale la suite dune s rie de guerres froides ou ouvertes entre environ 150 ap m et le triomphe final du communisme en 184 ap m
5861723 donc lhistoire moderne votre altesse lhistoire depuis le triomphe final et complet du communisme aura tout juste un si cle dici deux ans
5861724 correct maintenant nous nallons pas entrer dans les d tails de la longue s rie complexe de guerres qui a men au renversement final du capitalisme la russie sovi tique bien s r a men les forces du communisme les forces du capitalisme se rassemblaient principalement autour de ce que nous appelons maintenant les etats d sunis qui navait cess de perdre des alli s de lint rieur comme de lext rieur mais vous trouverez tout a dans vos livres dhistoire dont je vous ferai une liste avant que vous ne partiez
5861725 la raison centrale du succ s du communisme nous tions partis avec apparemment tous les d savantages possibles lennemi avait de meilleures armes lavantage technologique une plus grande production plus de ressources et pourtant nous lavons battu la fin parce que nous avions larme formidable qui leur manquait nous avions la foi foi en notre cause une foi qui na aucun moment faibli ou h sit nous savions que nous avions raison raison sur tout nous savions quils avaient tort tort sur tout
5861726 lennemi na jamais eu vraiment de foi dans le capitalisme
5861727 ils ont commenc avec tr s peu et lont rapidement perdu ceux qui avaient adopt l vangile du communisme taient pr ts mourir pour lui mais personne n tait dispos mourir pour le capitalisme cela aurait t une sorte de farce finalement le mieux que nos ennemis trouv rent dire en faveur du capitalisme cest que ce n tait pas le communisme m me eux ne semblaient pas penser que le capitalisme avait la moindre vertu positive et ils se contentaient de d noncer le communisme mais leur fa on de contrer le communisme tait de limiter ils faisaient hommage au capitalisme et ce quils appelaient lentreprise priv e ou libre entreprise plus personne ne sait ce que ces termes signifiaient mais chaque r forme quils mirent en place comme r ponse au communisme tait un pas de plus dans la direction du communisme chaque r forme quils adoptaient lindividu avait moins de pouvoir et letat toujours plus petit petit le contr le des individus sur les ressources et les biens leur a t retir petit petit cela fut envahi par letat au d but ce n tait pas la propri t mais simplement le droit de d cision qui fut accapar par letat mais ces idiots qui essayaient de r former le capitalisme nont pas vu que le pouvoir de d cision le pouvoir de disposer tait lessence de la propri t donc ils ont retir aux individus tape par tape le pouvoir de d cider de leurs propres prix ou de d cider ce quil fallait produire et en quelle quantit ou de louer ou cesser de louer du travail volont ou de d cider des termes de leurs contrats graduellement leurs gouvernements ont d cid de toutes ces choses mais morceau par morceau au lieu de le faire en un seul grand saut logique c tait amusant de les voir imiter servilement les plans quinquennaux communistes avec leurs propres plans quadriannuels ceux ci taient videmment comme les n tres des planifications detat aussi incroyable que cela puisse para tre ces gens semblaient vraiment croire que les appeler quadriannuels au lieu de quinquennaux emp cherait quiconque de reconna tre le plagiat en fait certains dentre eux taient trop stupides pour m me savoir ce quils taient en train de copier
5861728 bref tape par tape le monde capitaliste a accept les principes de base du communisme que lindividu livr lui m me est avide brutal stupide et irresponsable que lindividualisme et la libert sont de simples euph mismes pour la loi de la jungle ou la domination du plus fort en dautres termes des euph mismes pour lanarchie et que seul letat a la responsabilit seul letat a la sagesse seul letat peut tre juste seul letat peut faire usage du pouvoir
5861729 je ne comptais pas rentrer dans ces d tails tout de suite mais est ce si surprenant que le monde capitaliste a perdu est ce si surprenant quil na cess de perdre ses alli s lint rieur comme lext rieur savez vous ce que les chefs politiciens am ricains ont fait un moment ils ont envoy d normes sommes dargent pour essayer dacheter le reste du monde pour quil ne devienne pas communiste ils pensaient quils pouvaient acheter de la foi avec des dollars
5861730 quesp rez vous quil e t pu arriver les autres pays bourgeois ont compris que la fa on la plus simple dobtenir de largent des etats d sunis tait de subodorer quils pourraient devenir communistes sils nen recevaient pas et rapidement ils se sont mis croire que la seule raison pour laquelle ils ne devenaient pas communistes c tait pour rendre service aux etats d sunis et que leur seule raison de sarmer contre nous n tait pas leur propre pr servation mais encore une fois pour faire plaisir aux etats d sunis si lam rique bourgeoise voulait des armes se sont ils dit elle na qu payer pour les avoir et ils utilis rent le reste des fonds am ricains de toute fa on pour financer des programmes socialistes en dautres termes pour avancer sur la voie vers le communisme
5861731 est ce si surprenant que bien quils aient parvenu corrompre quelques espions parmi nous nous avions des l gions despions b n voles parmi eux des gens qui nous donnaient linformation avec joie de leur plein gr des gens que nous navions pas payer des gens qui trahissaient leur pays pour reprendre la phrase de condamnation que les nations capitalistes avaient essay dadopter des gens qui trahissaient leur pays dans lexultation par sens du devoir parce que leurs pays avaient tort et parce quils servaient une meilleure cause la cause de lhumanit
5861732 bien jesp re que vous me pardonnez si je me laisse emporter loin du sujet
5861733 tout cela est pr cis ment ce que jai besoin dapprendre mais puis je poser une question pourquoi alors est ce que les pays bourgeois ont combattu le communisme
5861734 ils se sont battus contre le communisme parce quils taient contre le communisme c tait la seule chose sur laquelle ils parvenaient sentendre mais ils ne savaient pas ce quils d fendaient tout le monde tait pour quelque chose de diff rent personne navait le courage de d fendre un capitalisme qui r pondait vraiment aux principes de base du capitalisme chacun avait son propre plan pour un capitalisme r form ils pouvaient endiguer le communisme pensaient ils uniquement sils parvenaient corriger les abus mais tous leurs plans pour corriger ces abus taient des tapes vers le communisme et le socialisme ils se sont entred chir s pour d cider jusquo ils devaient aller sur le chemin du communisme pour vaincre le communisme jusquo ils devaient embrasser les id es communistes pour d truire les id es communistes je sais que a para t incroyable mais je vous assure que cest vrai
5861735 mais ny avait il personne pour avoir foi dans le capitalisme
5861736 pas dans le sens o tout le monde de notre c t avait foi et a encore foi aujourdhui dans le communisme les plus forts dentre nos ennemis taient moiti convaincus de leur propre cause ils se contentaient de sexcuser de leur capitalisme ils disaient que le capitalisme avec toutes ses failles et ils taient en comp tition f roce pour voir qui lui trouverait le plus de failles que le capitalisme avec toutes ses failles tait probablement juste aussi bien quon puisse esp rer raisonnablement et ainsi de suite et donc nous les avons an anti

5861747 tabled or opposed 20 million dollars in veterans health care facilities 430 million dollars for outpatient care one billion 500 million dollars in additional medical care to be created by closing tax loopholes for the rich and one billion 800 million dollars for additional veterans medical care by closing other tax loopholes
5861748 o mercado daqui n o paga bem e meio nivelado por baixo
5861749 a impress o que eu tenho que este mercado tem um grande n mero de profissionais n o celitistas que n o est o de acordo com a clt normas que regulamentam os direitos trabalhistas principalmente por causa de alguns aspectos o fato dos empregados serem muitos vol teis pois n o ficam muito tempo num mesmo local e por causa dos sal rios serem acima da m dia nacional que podem chegar a at r 10 mil ou r 11 mil em s o paulo o que poderia significar duplicar os custos com impostos para as empresas
5861750 ao argumento de que a concorr ncia grande empregados v em seus direitos sendo subtra dos ao serem impelidos a constitu rem pessoas jur dicas ou a aderirem a cooperativas por exemplo mas ainda permanecendo subordinados estrutura da empresa e quando n o s o mais necess rios sendo dispensados sem nada receber fgts indeniza o seguro desemprego etc
5861751 na su a por exemplo n o existe direitos dos trabalhadores porque l n o necess rio na verdade essa uma caracter stica de um pa s em desenvolvimento onde precisamos proteger o ponto mais fraco para conseguir o desenvolvimento por isso esses direitos s o t o essenciais no brasil
5861752 por m existem empres rios que acreditam numa f rmula m gica e tentam mascarar essa rela o trabalhista o que perante a lei n o existe
5861753 eles ofereceram uma proposta de equival ncia repassando para n s parte daquilo que pagavam de impostos e recontrataram todos como se f ssemos empresas n o nos for aram mas disseram que esta seria uma maneira de ajudar sab amos que quem n o aceitasse seria visto com maus olhos
5861754 no fim eles at nos deram aviso pr vio mas sem nenhuma expectativa de retorno
5861755 por m n o podemos pensar que para termos um mercado competitivo precisamos manter condi es desumanas como acontece na ndia onde os trabalhadores chegam a passar 16 horas nos seus empregos e s o limados de um relacionamento social e familiar saud vel
5861756 n s estamos tentando levar esta discuss o para a c mara americana do com rcio pois precisamos trazer esse assunto tona e tentar sensibilizar as demandas estaduais n o queremos beneficiar as empresas mas enxergar as diferen as deste setor e tentar algo que seja bom para as duas partes
5861757 muito se discute a respeito da mudan a da legisla o para que alguns tributos deixem de ter como base de c lculo a folha salarial e passe a ser baseado na lucratividade das empresas por exemplo esse seria um mecanismo que poderia atender aos dois lados da balan a
5861758 a atual situa o ainda torna o mercado ainda mais desigual para quem est regularizado trabalhamos de acordo com a lei porque isso faz parte da concep o da nossa empresa por m j perdi tr s bons funcion rios de uma nica vez porque um concorrente burlava os impostos e pagava mais no fim do m s depois todos foram demitidos e acabaram ficando na rua da armagura
5861759 a minha esperan a por m que com o crescimento do porto digital e do setor as empresas comecem a voltar a nos contratar via clt
5861760 when the the bulk of the surfing community is spending time at only a couple of surf locations in second life those locations that dont see traffic will close down
5861761 there is no reason to offer something that is expensive to run when people are not using it for the record tch epic surf zone will remain open and fully operational
5861762 i certainly wouldnt have a full beach sim without my store to cover the costs

5861764 barack obama has generated so much excitement that some progressives i talk to simply think there is no way he could lose and its not really hard to see why
5861765 obama is a terrific candidate and republicans have definitely made a mess of things but the truth is obama also faces some real hurdles between now and november
5861766 we can win but were gonna have to fight for every vote
5861767 when i hear women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and theres not the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad i get frustrated
5861768 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender the thought of it makes my blood boil thats what were fighting for
5861769 those bitches should just go get a damned job and close their legs

5861780 people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are i dont believe in circumstances the people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they cant find them make them
5861781 that lady is having a bad day maybe you should call her
5861782 according to the 2005 06 survey of attendance at selected culture and leisure venues and events some 5 5 million people 34 of the population aged 15 years and over visited a national state or local library at least once in the 12 months before interview
5861783 while the attendance rates for males and females at state and national libraries were similar local libraries were more likely to attract females with an attendance rate of 40 than males 25
5861784 unlike several of the other cultural institutions public libraries regularly attract repeat visitors only 5 of those who visited a library did so on one occasion almost one half 46 of those who had visited public libraries had been more than 10 times during the 12 month reference period with over half of those going more than 20 times
5861785 the percentage of internet users who use search engines on a typical day has been steadily rising from about one third of all users in 2002 to a new high of just under one half 49 with this increase the number of those using a search engine on a typical day is pulling ever closer to the 60 of internet users who use email arguably the internets all time killer app on a typical day
5861786 1 most people claim they would support the library at the ballot box fewer are firmly committed to it 2 there is a lot that people dont know about their public libraries 3 library support is only marginally related to visitation advocating for library support to library users focuses effort and energy on the wrong target group 4 perceptions of the librarian are highly related to support passionate librarians who are involved in the community make a difference 5 the library occupies a very clear position in peoples minds as a provider of practical answers and information this is a very crowded space and to remain relevant in todays information landscape repositioning will be required 6 belief that the library is a transformational force in peoples lives is directly related to their level of funding support 7 increasing support for libraries may not necessarily mean a trade off with financial support for other public services 8 elected officials are supportive of the library but not fully committed to increasing funding engaging super supporters and probable supporters to help elevate library funding needs is required
5861787 the report suggests that targeting marketing messages to the right segments of the voting public is key to driving increased support for u s public libraries
5861788 ive always done everything i just think of myself as an entertainer in all forms

5861798 the material seized from you is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts

5861805 you kept quiet for 30 years i couldnt have kept quiet for 30 minutes
5861806 actually i was lucky because i married a mathematician from hut 6 so although we never talked to the family or anyone else we have talked about it to each other
5861807 other people had to force it so far down that they have forgotten it all and its very difficult to collect oral history it was the way to do it nobody talked to anybody outside their own unit because if the germans had ever found out that we had broken their codes that would have been the crown jewels gone
5861808 one should never forget the poles who first uncovered enigma and dilly knox arrived absolutely on day one he was the pioneer he was an absolutely wonderful character and very easy to work with but he was odd just like someone out of alice in wonderland
5861809 i must absolutely emphasise that i take absolutely no credit for this i was the one who happened to get the message to decode
5861810 most of the time we never knew what it was that we broke because once we had worked out the crib we passed it to a machinist to decode the whole message

5861818 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by the welfarism and political correctness if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle it is
5861819 it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5861820 that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5861821 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority gla or the title of first deputy mayor i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5861822 as far as tim is concerned his appointment was boriss biggest coup by far he is a very successful businessman who was going to be chief executive of london somehow all of that has gone for a piece of chalk
5861823 relationships on the eighth floor are riddled with tensions and while boris was keen to give him this position of first deputy mayor mr parkers colleagues were clearly not supportive
5861824 the wheels are coming off this new administration why is boris losing yet another adviser has tim parker discovered that running london isnt as easy as running private business

5861828 it was famously vital in enabling britain to survive in 1940 41 and then for the allies to triumph in 1945 but more than that as the birthplace of the computer it was one of the three crucibles with peenem nde in germany and los alamos in the us in which the modern world was forged it stands for the triumph of intelligence over barbarism we would let down not only the generation who worked in bletchley but our childrens generation if we failed to preserve it for posterity
5861829 good minds at bletchley helped save their generation from evil now this generation must help save it
5861830 the worst suggestion i heard was that we should preserve the country house and tear down all the wooden huts because they are rotten and unsightly
5861831 they may be unsightly but that is where history was made if they just took a little of the millions they are spending on the 2012 olympics they could save this site
5861832 the cavaliers brain is like a size ten foot that has been shoved into a size six shoe
5861833 it is described in humans as one of the most painful conditions you can have a piston type headache if you took a stick and beat a dog to create that pain youd be prosecuted but theres nothing to stop you breeding a dog with it
5861834 i defy anybody to say that they would approve of brother sister mating or father daughter mating in humans
5861835 and yet if you speak to dog breeders father daughter or father granddaughter mating is common they must know that this is going to cause problems
5861836 when i watch crufts what i see is a parade of mutants
5861837 its some freakish garish beauty pageant that frankly has nothing to do with health and welfare
5861838 but it is far less common than it ever was in the past we are the ones that are trying to put things right
5861839 if dog breeders insist on going further down that road
5861840 i can say with confidence that there is a universe of suffering waiting for many of these breeds

5861857 would russia have done what it did in georgia if america wasnt bogged down in iraq
5861858 you must realize that russia has power and is worthy of respect
5861859 if you want a 21st century version of the cuban missle crisis by putting an abm system in poland and the czech republic that can be arranged and you will be destabilizing europe
5861860 why of course the people dont want war why should some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor for that matter in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
5861861 beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor for patriotism is indeed a double edged sword it both emboldens the blood just as it narrows the mind and when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry rather the citizenry infused with fear and blinded by patriotism will offer up all of their rights unto the leader and gladly so how do i know for this is what i have done and i am caesar
5861862 i hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can only as one who has seen its brutality its futility its stupidity
5861863 we are tired of fighting and dying for a bunch of rich republicans who make no sacrifice

5861873 i always suspected that bryan was fooling around on me but had no real proof he would stay out all night on occasions and come home hung over i never really wanted to believe it though i always felt like he loved me on many occasions before bryans conversion i wished that i could just stop loving him so that i could just leave and not feel pain i loved him no matter what and somehow i knew he loved me too so leaving was never a real option besides i had two small children to raise and not having a daddy was not an option
5861874 plenty of people tried to tell me what a great woman i was for sticking by him others just thought i was stupid for staying but i just felt trapped and made a fool of for so long
5861875 i suddenly felt like my whole marriage was a lie that i had been naive i was angry with him because he hadnt told me before we married so that i could make my decision based on the truth i felt cheated from the purity i had committed to in my marriage
5861876 when i found out that bryan had been unfaithful it was after his conversion he only confessed this to me after i had asked him if there was any other way he could have contracted hiv other than sharing needles i was devastated when i learned that on three separate occasions he had had a one night stand i asked a lot of questions about who what when how but all he could tell me was the color of their hair he didnt know any names somehow this made me feel better knowing that he didnt have any feelings other than sexual toward these women i also realized he was now a changed man so i couldnt hold it against him although it hurt me god helped me to forgive him
5861877 god was always faithful to me during these difficult days even though bryan wasnt
5861878 i drew all of my strength from him and learned that he was the only constant in my life god protected me and my children from contracting hiv and always provided everything that i needed i learned to put all my trust in him
5861879 i never wanted to marry again after bryan died or so i thought but god had a different plan for me
5861880 i always thought it would be a turn off to someone knowing that i had a husband that had died of aids anyone would be afraid to be intimate with me god definitely blessed me with someone who didnt share that view and i am reaping the benefits of being faithful including a post vasectomy baby god does have a sense of humor
5861881 that all things work together for good to those who love god
5861882 naked i came from my mothers womb and naked i will depart
5861883 depend ing greatly upon the outstretched arms of the body of christ at that time to just be there through a very disorienting time of my life the body of christ became a tangible picture to me of gods abiding love and faithfulness
5861884 i see that if i dont stay connected to the vine of christ i too could walk away i want to view my moms life from an outsiders point of view and see any weaknesses in her that may be in me asking god to help me overcome them his way
5861885 my husband told me i received a package yesterday but i had no idea it would be this large it was from philosophy and for what i thought i should be getting extremely heavy i was totally perplexed
5861886 lets just say that philosophy went above and beyond my expectations i didnt just get a replacement bottle of perfume i received a gorgeous gift box full of every product under the grace product line or so it seems
5861887 her initial impression of hopeless disparity among the attendees was giving way to a realisation that the conference was as much a celebration of a subculture as an assault on relativity

5861903 the real problem is that no one is fixing their sites
5861904 the same tens of thousands of sites get infected over and over with different malware using the same methods a few class action lawsuits could be a good incentive to fix this
5861905 should hundreds of millions of disclosure messages have gone out we dont want to create unnecessary noise or panic or distract from the messages that really matter

5861943 theres no question that unions have done much good for this country their tenacious efforts have benefited millions of workers and helped build a strong middle class they gave workers a new voice and pushed for laws that protect individuals from unfair treatment they have been a friend to the democratic party
5861944 if anyone is really that hung up on the secret ballot crap then they should be asked why they arent upset by the fact that current law allows unions to be decertified by card check the only change with the employee free choice act is whether card check recognition is at the discretion of the employer of the worker in other words it changes absolutely zero about whether the right of workers to organize is determined by secret ballot or not the only thing it changes is who gets to decide the manner of certification workers or employers

5861954 my hope is that whoever is in the white house next year assigns the highest priority to tackling these serious problems threatening americas future we need a united front and bipartisan solutions to address the crisis and i applaud the creators of i o u s a for bringing the attention this issue deserves to the big screen

5861968 in 2007 obama told the planned parenthood action fund that the freedom of choice act would be the first piece of legislation that he would sign as president the act would not only codify roe v wade but wipe out all current federal state and local restrictions on abortion that pass muster under roe including the hyde amendment prohibiting federal funding of abortion this is not the legislative priority of a man keenly attuned to the moral implications of abortion
5861969 recently the state of california commissioned a study which showed that building a 100 megawatt solar thermal plant would provide ten times the economic benefit of a comparable coal fired power plant it would create 4000 person years of employment and a net net 628 million of economic benefit

5861991 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
5861992 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offence known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
5861993 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
5861994 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
5861995 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defencive state
5861996 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5861997 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5861998 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5861999 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defences protecting the brain from infection
5862000 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5862001 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5862002 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5862003 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5862004 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5862005 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5862006 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb

5862026 martin and bernice have taken various actions that were antithetical to the goals of the king center and inconsistent with their fiduciary duties as directors of the king center

5862028 any filing that will help expedite the unification of this family is great in my view
5862029 in opposition to the stated goals of the king center

5862031 in direct conflict with her duties to the king center
5862032 wiping out poverty and injustice through programs that foster peace and nonviolent social change
5862033 the king center was unable after numerous attempts over a long period of time to convince martin and bernice to stop using the king center for their own personal gain
5862034 the king center is a charitable tax exempt organization and it had to take action to protect its tax exempt status and to ensure that no individual profits personally from resources that should be dedicated to the foundation
5862035 all five of the heirs of dr king signed a contract assigning to the estate all rights they had related to dr king including their own personal rights arising from their own relationships with dr king
5862036 the purpose of the contract was to insure that dr kings legacy would be managed consistently and cohesively these two heirs are now ignoring that binding contract and are using property of the estate to advance their own personal agendas
5862037 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station

5862098 all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
5862099 nato is trying to turn an aggressor into a victim is attempting to whitewash a criminal regime and save a fallen regime and is taking a course toward re arming the current georgian leaders the north atlantic treaty organization has in fact taken saakashvili under its protection

5862108 justice is the issue of doing the right thing regardless of the cost
5862109 those resources could have been used for something else and the value of the other things they could have been used for is really what were trying to compare to the value you get from having the death penalty
5862110 what evidence do you have here today that any case in my jurisdiction in the last 30 years has been dropped lost missed dismissed because i have people trying the death penalty
5862111 but i would like to make the point that were not trying to make the argument that there was a wholesale breakdown in the criminal justice system in some way were simply saying those hours have to come from somewhere
5862112 capital punishment drags victims loved ones through an agonizing and lengthy process holding out the promise of one punishment in the beginning and often resulting in a life sentence in the end anyway
5862113 the holy father spoke so strongly about it and brought the whole thing into focus for me and made it much more reasonable for me to be pro life let us be pro life across the board especially when we have found so many that were being threatened death and found out it was an error somewhere or some bias

5862216 why did you even waste any time on the shitty experience that is grad school
5862217 these children have a very serious infection that is causing tissue necrosis the death of the tissue
5862218 its not like it is in older children and adults where its generally an invasive group a strep but indeed it is a necrotizing tissue destroying infection that theyve got
5862219 the review has not in any way turned up anything that would cause concern for mothers to be and the lethbridge region
5862220 if we had any concerns that there was something related to the hospital its dr mustos responsibility to shut the hospital down
5862221 in this particular incidence weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection
5862222 because its such an unusual event that there is two of these children that have such a significant infection we thought it wise to ask for another review of this and this is normal practice
5862223 because of the privacy act we need a formally signed consent form from the parents to release any information about the condition of the children
5862224 we dont have that and i dont think were going to be getting it
5862225 we will carry on the luxurious visual styles of both operas

5862229 at the core of all of this is what it means to be a public broadcaster
5862230 and that is to provide programming for all canadians and to reflect the arts and culture scene in canada and to reflect canada back to canadians
5862231 so cbc is greatly compressing that kind of music which you could call serious music into a listening ghetto of 10 a m to 3 p m
5862232 i say ghetto just because they know anybody who looks at the numbers knows that the available audience between 10 and 3 is very small compared with mornings or evenings or the drive home or drive to work period

5862235 we dont take groups trying to establish themselves here lightly
5862236 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5862237 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5862238 polls do indicate that the next election is in all likelihood a minority one way or the other
5862239 the fact of the matter is what i will have to decide over the next few weeks is whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government needs a new mandate
5862240 i will assess it this fall we are during the summer and there are byelections to win
5862241 have to make a judgment in the next little while
5862242 they have no intention of respecting the fixed election date
5862243 so i think obviously were going to have to judge how the parliamentary agenda is unfolding
5862244 harpers telling you hes not going to wait for an election
5862245 the liberals have been rolling over on their backs like kitties saying pet me
5862246 so we havent seen any disruption weve seen a government hell bent on having an election and has been hell bent on it for quite a while
5862247 it looks to me like hes been able to get virtually everything through with the help of the liberals
5862248 if i realize that stephen harper has the intention to go ahead with a right wing agenda that is not good for quebec the bloc quebecois will use its first opposition day to table a non confidence motion
5862249 we had some concerns this morning because we are not sure what is in these old hotels it seems as though the wind is calm however and the rain is keeping the particulates close to the fire as our monitor is not picking up anything unusual
5862250 as we are located on queensway and upwind we do not register some activity it seems there have been a few fires in the same location lately that we have not picked up on we have been pushing for years to obtain a van or trailer we can drive to a site and monitor from the actual location these would be ideal in instances where fires could last for long periods of time and really have an impact
5862251 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5862252 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5862253 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5862254 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that

5862259 there can be little doubt that rhode islanders have a significant interest in ensuring that highly qualified individuals seeking lifetime judicial appointments are selected in as open and accessible a process as possible
5862260 this advisory opinion is based upon the specific provision that the judicial nominating commission asked us to review and reflects the essence of the access to public records act in ensuring an open and honest government that also protects an individuals privacy interests
5862261 this is a milestone in our partnership with the childrens health forum because this project makes the dupont agreement real
5862262 with the issuance of this rfp we begin the process of remediating homes harboring lead paint that have housed generations of families and making them lead safe for the families living in them now and in the future at the end of this three year effort we will have eradicated the threat of lead contamination in 600 units in our low income inner city target areas combined with the healthy kids collaboratives ongoing education and outreach projects our work will increase protections for hundreds of rhode islands infants and children empowering them to grow and thrive free from suffering from the debilitating effects of lead poisoning
5862263 the childrens health forum is pleased to begin the remediation of housing units in rhode island the most ambitious part of our program to ensure lead safety for rhode island children and families we have been working for months to promote lead safety through community based outreach and education in rhode island and this latest step is a new chapter in chfs partnership with the state we are honored to be part of this effort to protect children from harmful exposures to lead hazards and are committed to the programs ultimate success

5862266 how do you tell your children about the affair you dont
5862267 how do i tell the kids about the divorce a create a storybook guide to preparing your children with love
5862268 unless they are celebrity or politician kids who unfortunately learn about it in the news this is not a topic to discuss with your children unless they are over 18 or even older this is adult business of the most complex nature and cannot be assimilated into explanations for children
5862269 the kids already know on some level that mom and dad are not getting along and there is family tension so its just a matter of sitting them down and giving words to their instincts if theyre old enough
5862270 in edwards case the media make it impossible to keep it secret from the kids but most couples dont have that problem
5862271 the betrayed spouse of course is upset but needs to be careful who she tells in her anguish
5862272 its much better to have a confidential and objective support person like a counselor to talk to
5862273 so many couples recover from this and decide to stay together but you cant know at the outset how youre going to feel later

5862276 in sickness and in health means ill be with you whether youre healthy or not easy to say not so easy to do
5862277 nothing makes anyone cheat except his or her own volition however if a spouse is going through a long drawn out illness or alzheimers or mental illness the idea of cheating becomes more attractive
5862278 to ensure you are both on the same page and have the same boundaries
5862279 there is no set list of what situations will trigger a persons choice to betray their partner but there are situations that can make a person more vulnerable those vary from person to person the key is to know yourself well enough to understand your weak points and avoid situations that will encourage destructive behavior
5862280 we tend to forget that our partner is human we are all going to be overwhelmed bored and confused at times there will be times when we want to run away from our lives and as much as we hate to admit it to ourselves and one another there will be times when we are attracted to other people if you allow your partner to be open and honest about who they are and how they feel as well as speak authentically about who you are and how you feel theres a better chance of working through issues before they manifest themselves into something bigger and more destructive
5862281 history is prologue and were creatures of habit who we are and how we have reacted in the past will likely effect how we respond in the present yes illness of a partner can create stress depression disappointment distance but sickness doesnt make you cheat
5862282 in the case of edwards i think there was a lethal combination grief fear and ego that contributed to his downfall men generally have fewer resources for working through feelings and often lean on a woman if the wifes illness is the cause of the feelings he may lean on another woman and the connection can become sexual or he was just messing around
5862283 its also essential to communicate with your partner something too many couples avoid doing because they are resentful worry they will be shamed by their partner or afraid to cause tension in the relationship there needs to be room for both parties to live and breathe and feel safe to express how they are feeling
5862284 the partner of a sick person may want to be supportive and loving but feel helpless or try and avoid the sickness all together they take on the ignore it and maybe it will go away stance which is not only selfish and hurtful to the partner who needs you and feels abandoned and rejected but totally destructive to the relationship that said it is essential the sick partner make room for their spouse to share what they are going through there needs to be a place for him or her to share the scary human emotions that are likely to come along with having your spouses life threatened
5862285 nothing makes someone cheat but overwhelming situations tend to encourage people to seek some kind of refuge sometimes this is destructive such as drinking too much after a hard week at work taking drugs to escape a bad situation cheating on your partner etc
5862286 those who are self centered and pleasure principal oriented will more likely look for a quick fix for feelings of vulnerability rather than working through the emotional issues with their partner this is more difficult if there were already problems in the marriage that the sickness then compounds yet developing adaptive strategies to self soothe can serve you in the inevitable crises youll face over a lifetime
5862287 you do need support if your spouse is seriously ill you cant always talk to your spouse about your anger frustration and helplessness in the face of the spouses illness
5862288 we in america are phobic about illness and death which makes it more stressful unless you have professional help to deal with your fears and stress you can easily make bad choices

5862299 blacks are more likely to get divorced because first they are poorer and poverty strains marriages and second because african american culture places more weight on ties to grandmothers aunts and other kin than does european american culture compared to the ties between husbands and wives
5862300 may provide an important insight for understanding the low and decreasing marriage rate for the group as well as the high proportion of the birth to unmarried black women
5862301 70 percent of black womens first marriages will end in divorce as will 47 percent of white womens marriages
5862302 it is likely that the more uncertain the prospects for marital stability the more the potential gains from marriage are decreased and the potential costs increased
5862303 marriage is virtually extinct in the black community in the u s today
5862304 a person born in the black community has a 70 percent chance of being born to an unmarried couple
5862305 what puts more pressure on an afro american married couple is that the female earns more than the male in many instances and she has a more favorable career track that upsets the apple cart in the natural order of things
5862306 as the head of a household so goes the family if the head of a household is a man who isnt pulling his weight then he makes the whole family vulnerable
5862307 in recent years there is harshness to black womanhood because her world is harder and tougher it makes it makes marriage for her much more fragile
5862308 there was a time when there was a stigma if a woman wasnt married in the black community particularly if she was pregnant today i run into women in the black community that want a baby but not a husband i think its their maternal instinct but they dont want the jerk that comes with the baby
5862309 the afro american community has attempted to integrate itself into mainstream american society
5862310 the more weve tried to do this the more weve accepted the views of mainstream american society the black communitys chase for money and material things has caused us to push aside the family and family values
5862311 the study was produced by five scholars lorraine blackman indiana university school of social work and the african american family life education institute obic clayton department of sociology morehouse college norval glenn department of sociology university of texas linda malone colon department of psychology hampton university and the national healthy marriage resource center and alex roberts institute for american values
5862312 i try to remain hopeful that somehow marriage for african americans will improve but im not sure how it can be turned around and improved when black women have few reference points to guide them

5862320 its just another year of experience i feel good i feel confident
5862321 hes really gotten to the point now where if he misses one hes just sick
5862322 he knows how hard it is to protect get it just right and when you get him open to hit and hes missed a couple but not many
5862323 i dont know how he gets the ball in there
5862324 i think his knowledge of the offense is really unbelievable as far as how much he can process and read and analyze defenses he knows his stuff in and out
5862325 i definitely want to be perfect or as close to perfect as i can out there on the field
5862326 matts always been a guy you can look to for leadership
5862327 if you asked me what i was looking for going into the game obviously a clean sheet obviously a few goals and a good performance
5862328 i got bits and pieces of everything and not everything that i was looking for to be honest with you
5862329 but we will go away and look at it again when we meet with the coaches but it has certainly stood us in good stead that is for sure going into the portugal game at wembley
5862330 it was a mixed bag really i know we can certainly play better than that you should never underestimate winning certainly at international level as well so that is a positive to take from it
5862331 we had maybe five or six that competed for their clubs on sunday so obviously we were aware of that situation and maybe one or two tonight had not featured for their clubs this season yet
5862332 but we can pass the ball better and we can play better than that but every step at this age group is a learning curve for the players
5862333 yeah definitely all the players here are trying to make an impression all i can do is give 100 percent and try and get back in the squad
5862334 it is not a problem for me being back in the under 21s i will just give 100 percent for the under 21s and hopefully it will be enough to get back into the squad
5862335 we have got a good squad of lads here and it is not just me who can move up you know there is james milner and i dont want to mention names but there is loads of us that can move up and hopefully we can do
5862336 we need to guard against turning technical and business decisions into political decisions
5862337 for me as a carrier i need to satisfy the voip customer whether its mine or someone elses is irrelevant here by delivering those packets in a timely fashion
5862338 that may mean that for economic reasons within the network to keep the cost reasonable to keep the price reasonable that i need to slow down whats not a time sensitive file
5862339 get all incensed and they accuse me of violating things i didnt even know that i could violate
5862340 doing a p2p download or e mail they arent going to see that 22 millisecond delay and yet thats the kind of thing that seems to cause paranoia
5862341 governments need to make sure they have a very thorough record
5862342 it was such a great phrase that its morphed into more than what it really is
5862343 you have to peel it back and ask what do you really mean
5862344 i do get very very concerned that the people who are taking things like deep packet inspection and making it a horrible thing need to look at it from an engineers viewpoint
5862345 feel comfortable that their content will be dealt with in the way they truly believe it should be
5862346 i cant tell you that i will police for you

5862419 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting

5862427 the result has been driven by well balanced revenue and mix management and tight cost control programs across the business
5862428 in addition cca continues to benefit from efficiency gains from its capital spending program while the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages contributed nearly 20 per cent of the australian beverage business growth
5862429 we will achieve this through tight control of expenses targeted and tailored marketing investment and ensuring an inventory balance consistent with sales
5862430 against a backdrop of flat to negative economic outlook for retail for the first half at least we are focussed on ensuring the business is trading at peak performance and ready to capitalise on the eventual upturn in activity
5862431 despite economic conditions we remained focussed on core brands and delivered profitable growth
5862432 despite its stable of strong brands pacific brands has not been completely immune to the recent downturn
5862433 we have found the top end manchester market and womens fashion footwear to be particularly sensitive to the change in consumer sentiment
5862434 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5862435 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5862436 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5862437 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5862438 despite the strong performance and excellent positioning of our airports security price performance has been disappointing so far in 2008
5862439 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance
5862440 feedback from our active program of engagement with investors has highlighted a changed attitude towards acceptable levels of leverage
5862441 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline
5862442 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the current external environment represents an excellent achievement and demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
5862443 we recognise that our airline customers face challenging conditions but the first half result is evidence of the importance of investing in airports with attractive characteristics and opportunities across the aviation and commercial businesses
5862444 whilst our financial position is very sound we recognise that attitudes towards leverage have changed if not permanently then for the foreseeable future
5862445 consequently we are applying our surplus cash to the repayment of our hybrid capital instrument tickets which will simplify maps capital structure
5862446 whilst there is no provision for early redemption we are offering tickets holders a withdrawal option with any remaining balance to be defeased and repaid on 1 january 2010
5862447 the discount to valuation which the current security price represents remains near record levels
5862448 a buyback of this scale also aids the quality and sustainability of our distributions and our commitment to achieve broad convergence between our regular distribution and proportionate earnings by 2010
5862449 conducted at prices that reflect our full directors valuations generating substantial premia to the prices for maps original investment of 49 per cent for copenhagen and 47 per cent for brussels
5862450 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
5862451 asur meets maps key investment criteria and we expect the returns from this investment to be well above that offered by current and proposed major airport privatisations
5862452 we believe this investment demonstrates maps continued ability to source attractive growth opportunities
5862453 the strong first half result is evidence of the stability of our earnings despite a volatile external backdrop and coupled with our proactive portfolio and capital review places map on the firmest possible footing for the future
5862454 the decrease over december 31 2007 reflects a comprehensive review of business and financing plans to incorporate all announced airline capacity reductions and the directors view of financing outcomes in both the short and long term
5862455 in addition asset specific risk premia have been increased to reflect the uncertainties created by the current external environment
5862456 map and its airports are in a strong operational and financial position
5862457 the boards and management of map consider the outlook for the rest of 2008 to be solid
5862458 notwithstanding the near term impact of the external environment a long term traffic growth forecast of 4 per cent to 5 per cent is maintained with an intention to enhance revenue yields through commercial initiatives and deliver further increments to ebitda via operational efficiencies
5862459 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
5862460 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
5862461 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
5862462 firstly we must continue to invest in our strategic priorities
5862463 secondly we must maintain our conviction for the way we manage money
5862464 finally we must respond to the overall decline in market levels by continuing to review elements of our cost base
5862465 the iraqis told us look i know you have good intentions here but youre messing up our lives
5862466 the best way to support the troops is to keep them alive when they get back
5862467 id run this team against anyone in the business and were adding four more rock star engineers in the last two weeks of this month damn look out look out
5862468 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year
5862469 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe
5862470 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5862471 although we expect our volume to remain below prior year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share
5862472 the company is comfortable with the bottom half of this range but notes there remains significant uncertainty over the outlook for us housing activity
5862473 the offer is very compelling in that it provides ausdrill shareholders with an above average takeover premium and provides them the opportunity to participate in a larger company with improved geographic and business diversification
5862474 the acquisition provides macmahon with increased scale in contract mining new capabilities in exploration drilling and increased geographic reach through ausdrills african operations
5862475 the combined group will hold a leading position in the australian contract mining and construction markets as well as a strong contract mining presence in africa
5862476 macmahon already has 1 2 billion of revenue secured for the 2009 full year and as per previous guidance is expecting to deliver annual profit growth of 20 to 30 per cent
5862477 subject to the timing of new work 2009 full year profit growth is likely be at the higher end of the 20 to 30 per cent range
5862478 notwithstanding the current turmoil in world financial markets and slowing economies the demand for contracting services remains strong particularly within the iron ore coal and government sectors
5862479 origin has rejected bg groups offer but has comprehensively failed to justify its position
5862480 we remain confident that our offer represents full and fair value for origins shareholders
5862481 forecast or other financial information which could assist shareholders in valuing the company and making a timely and informed decision
5862482 your directors believe bgs offer undervalues origins existing business and outstanding prospects and therefore recommend that you unanimously reject bgs offer
5862483 origin is a strongly performing australian integrated energy company with an impressive track record of growth
5862484 origin has developed the leading position in coal seam gas csg in australia and the strength of this position will be a key driver for continuing growth
5862485 you will need to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
5862486 a no good son of a bitch who robbed me blind
5862487 the 35 2 million payment appears to be wellcares effort to correct an outstanding issue it discovered and is likely an effort to help put the company on a better footing to negotiate a formal settlement for the still pending federal and state investigation
5862488 t he legal uncertainty is not lifted as the case is not settled and the possibility of further civil or criminal actions is possible
5862489 we remain cautious on wellcare shares while the investigation is ongoing and the information vacuum continues
5862490 its near impossible to overstate exiles importance as an astonishingly honest influential genre busting exercise
5862491 every time i see your face i think of things unpure unchaste i want to fuck you like a dog ill take you home and make you like it
5862492 be yourself because if you can get away with it that is the ultimate feminist act
5862493 the album made it ok for us girls to talk explicitly about sexuality in terms that only guys were allowed to use and it made it fine to acknowledge both the vulnerability as well as the fun and vulgar aspects of sexuality even if it was in the form of singing along
5862494 yes i wore a slinky red thing does that mean i should spread for you your friends your father mr ed
5862495 located emotional responses that werent being articulated by songs like jimmy mack
5862496 king grew up writing the boy centric songs in the brill building the new york office building famously used by music publishers and writers
5862497 with the exception of youre so vain which is about the peacockery of maledom her early records are very loving
5862498 but her songs were not especially saucer eyed theyre very realistic and mature
5862499 the same could be said of laura nyro and judee sill the language they use doesnt have the rage of alanis or liz phair or pj harvey but theres still some of that matching of rage to articulacy and thats unusual in pop
5862500 you could not play that on the radio now its incredibly filthy so its not as if it hadnt been expressed before liz phair
5862501 a lot of pop music is sold on its candour but its rarely as candid as guyville it opened up the expressive vocabulary for female artists
5862502 women dont have that long history of songwriting they cant refer to past examples which is why they go into themselves drawing on themselves
5862503 frequently almost tactical part of seduction its confession with a point
5862504 is not there to impress or to seduce its not a dance move
5862505 it wasnt written to elicit a response from this person or to seek any sort of revenge it was to unburden myself with my now allowing myself to just admit how i felt and in admitting how i felt by singing it so many times i kind of transcended it really i was able to admit all of this and to go forth from there instead of getting stuck
5862506 stand 6ft 1in instead of 5ft 2in and thats quite an achievement
5862507 we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is a recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness isnt there a fairytale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5862508 to be honest there just arent top quality men here
5862509 they are too busy drinking xxxx to notice the women and all they do is whistle or yell or beep as you go past those sorts of communication skills which i just love
5862510 weve got a saying up here the odds are good but the goods are odd
5862511 if you hate men we want to see photos of you in sexy lingerie
5862512 the barriers to womens full and equal participation in the paid workforce are real
5862513 we seem to allow some of our male politicians to be aggressive and pushy
5862514 its exhausting for me her being pregnant i dont know why during the birth process they only focus on the women what about the men standing there
5862515 come back when your iq is as high as your skirt
5862516 constantly asked why australian men say these kinds of things but british men and american men and men all around the world say them too
5862517 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5862518 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5862519 we are in the midst of a fierce correction from a period of indiscriminate behaviour in the credit markets a surfeit of homebuilding a global avalanche of cheap labour and correspondingly cheap imports and other unsustainable financial and economic activity
5862520 unless the python that is the us economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5862521 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation
5862522 the demand for loans is not there nor are banks willing to extend credit even if it were if this weakness becomes entrenched over the autumn it is a clear sign of very weak american output growth in 2009
5862523 we are reaching out to the hollywood community to do what we can to ensure their safety and security
5862524 it was an amazing feeling my dad had fixed it up for me i think it cost a fiver
5862525 he probably trains the hardest of anybody and hes very strict with himself but hes also a good guy he can turn off the competitive thing now and then and have a good laugh hes an inspiration
5862526 hes only human and hes got strengths and weaknesses well maybe not weaknesses maybe just weaker strengths but every time you do a personal best in training he gets up and beats it
5862527 you have to be very very careful about when you eat and when you rest
5862528 you get as much sleep as you can and you remind yourself that your opponents are having to do exactly the same as you so when youre tiring theyre tiring as well
5862529 i think the older you get the smarter you get you know the signs your body gives ive got stronger over the years ill have to take my foot off the gas pedal a little bit next year and try and build up for the london olympics but i feel very positive and im lucky i love what i do
5862530 i wouldnt be standing here with any medals round my neck if the meadowbank velodrome hadnt existed so who knows how many potential future olympic champions are out there why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down its about getting kids on bikes and into sport
5862531 i dont really care what people think or what people say
5862532 as far as i am concerned i am here and i won a gold medal they can say what they like but i really dont care
5862533 why should this be spoiled unless someone tries to im very happy with myself im very happy that i have picked up three gold medals in three major championships
5862534 i needed to sort my head out i felt tired i hadnt slept for the past two nights and the pressure was getting to me but i just thought keep going you can win
5862535 i am very busy and busy means i get a bit scatterbrained and that is just how i am i am not going to beat myself over it the mistake was made and you just move on
5862536 i didnt realise what people were saying until my brother called me and naturally it upset me
5862537 i have given thought to london but it is a long way away
5862538 it is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and it is where i was brought up and lived all my life so it would be great if i could say i would be there but it is a long way away
5862539 two caucasian males one wouldnt guess theyd respond differently to drugs but we found that for one drug metabolising gene watsons dna indicated he was likely to respond to drugs differently
5862540 we were given a breakdown of the tickets sold to the general public and the nocs
5862541 the posting is a malicious rumour and seriously damages the companys reputation
5862542 we have immediately asked relevant government departments to investigate those that started the rumour

5862546 wonderful mother who worked tirelessly to give her children a happy life
5862547 sally was a clever bright hard working girl who loved her job but more than anything she loved her children she was the most caring person i have ever known
5862548 we will remember sally as being caring hardworking intelligent and delightful to know she has achieved so much in her life and we miss her so much
5862549 detectives have this afternoon charged a man with the murder of mrs sally sinclair alisdair george sinclair 47 from amport near andover remains in police custody and will appear at basingstoke magistrates court tomorrow morning
5862550 mrs sinclairs body was discovered at her home in the village of amport at around 10pm on saturday august 16 a postmortem examination on sunday revealed that mrs sinclair died of stab wounds
5862551 we disagree with the administration that the endangered species act isnt a perfectly appropriate act to address global warming
5862552 the pika is very much the polar bear of the lower 48 states
5862553 people who have been part of a war that i consider immoral and illegal still have more legitimacy than people who were against the war from the very beginning and refused to fight in it
5862554 they command more of a sense of authority and more of a sense of understanding of whats actually happening on the ground generals who come out against the war are seen as more important even than congress members who are against the war
5862555 when youre coming out of the military the one thing that you lose bigger than anything else is the camaraderie of your unit
5862556 youve got family youve got friends but you dont have the people who have been there and thats a huge thing in this community we have that whether they want to live here or they want to stay a weekend or they just want to come over and watch some tv for a little while its just a space for veterans
5862557 our military is trained to kill people and were the bullies
5862558 i didnt sign up in the military to be a bully i signed up to protect people from bullies we started to talk about iraq and iraq just didnt pass the smell test
5862559 i thought that if i resisted they would put me in jail
5862560 most of us were ncos in the military so were good at telling people to clean up shit
5862561 the ptsd is so thick in the air you can cut it with a knife
5862562 i had been seeing a girl for about two weeks at the time and she was here and that ended that relationship
5862563 they let me flare up like that and they gave me that space and then as i naturally came down of that i was able to say im sorry i was not thinking naturally
5862564 if i have a conversation with a kid in high school and he decides hes not going to join the military thats a direct action
5862565 a war resister inside the military is both but that doesnt necessarily make it more effective i would rather have 1 000 high school students who would otherwise not join than one person within the military resist thats taking 1 000 bodies out of the system as opposed to taking one out
5862566 im kind of an anxious person im kind of antsy i have a lot of quirks that make people uncomfortable but being around cats like this its second nature nobody really notices it
5862567 theres a certain environment that were able to create here that is distinctly for veterans who have the freedom of mind to see that theyve been lied to that essentially a certain element of their service was for nothing
5862568 an environment that empowers them to live out their convictions
5862569 baggy jeans the defendant was wearing and the lace used to keep them up
5862570 its was very upsetting when the jury got dismissed it was dreadful im feeling a bit devastated
5862571 has aroused the ire of musicians and not all of them classical traditionalists damon albarn lead singer of blur and co creator of gorillaz argues that schoolchildren should be forced to learn staff notation
5862572 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for if its about accessing the western classical tradition then of course you need to learn staff notation if you think its about giving children some understanding of a wide range of musical traditions then teachers should have the flexibility to talk about other ways in which music is transmitted
5862573 the imposition of empty rates which has created more uncertainty and imposed a further financial burden on commercial property

5862577 the russian side supports the deployment of a considerable number of additional observers in the security zone
5862578 its very very important that georgian people know that the british government and british people stand in solidarity with them against threats to them their life their livelihood and their country
5862579 thrilled and gratified by the support and solidarity the uk government and mr miliband himself has showed to our people
5862580 they took everything from cars to toilet paper and everything they didnt take they destroyed
5862581 we are not pulling troops out were pulling them back pull back this is the term we use
5862582 weve been on this path for the last few years
5862583 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
5862584 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
5862585 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
5862586 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
5862587 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
5862588 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
5862589 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
5862590 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
5862591 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
5862592 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk
5862593 london challenge has been very successful it tells us that additional resources and improvement strategies need to be precisely targeted if schools are to receive the right kind of support to raise achievement and in particular to narrow the achievement gap between rich and poor
5862594 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5862595 at gcse the gap in achievement between children from poorer and more affluent backgrounds is narrowing and results for children on free school meals are rising faster than the average since 2002 the percentage of pupils on free school meals achieving five or more a c grades at gcse has risen by 12 5 percentage points in comparison with 9 1 percentage points for pupils not on free school meals
5862596 at first he asked to be allowed to enter thailand but he was refused he said he had not committed any offence here but he was told he was not wanted here
5862597 i am not getting back on the plane with all the press there
5862598 and im not going to the first class lounge to be hassled by them and im not going to london you cant make me i have done my time i am a free man
5862599 i want to see anyone who poses a threat to our children dealt with as firmly as possible
5862600 ive spoken to child protection experts and the police and they have told me that these changes will further restrict the ability of child sex offenders to harm children both here and overseas
5862601 this is a massive project of global significance and youve got to be in to win it
5862602 the beauty of us being able to put forward potentially a combined bid if you look at the geographic spread we can provide all the way from perth in the west to new zealand in the east that is a sizeable array of radio telescopes
5862603 success in rowing sailing and track cycling can essentially be bought by siphoning off money from the public purse and handing it to the athletes who are then able to train like professionals success in sport like in the agricultural market is easier when it receives huge state subsidies
5862604 well see a black islamist pm before we see a gay man kissing his other half on the steps of no 10
5862605 a sensible coordination of all political and military elements of the afghan theatre of operation does not exist
5862606 please note that question 27 on page 242 and its associated answer on page 244 are incorrect mr blunkett declared his directorship and shareholding in dna bioscience fully and as required by the ministerial code of conduct
5862607 i think we are moving from a period when if you like celebrity matters
5862608 er i dont mean the kind of people you put in your magazine obviously i mean those people who are famous only for being on tv
5862609 i have a bmw parked just down the hill im not short of money i could have afforded a hotel why am i here
5862610 we lead such non elemental lives this makes life elemental again
5862611 you sound more interesting than some slob whos been topping up his tan
5862612 every gallery here was stacked full of paintings and sculpture
5862613 figurative art is not very fashionable and i think its because people have got this notion that its about views of venice and portraits and nudes and that sort of stuff out of 2 700 entries we didnt have a single view of venice we want to show that there are works of figurative art which are edgy which are topical which are handling difficult issues
5862614 i think it would be cool to play in the world series of poker
5862615 my game is a little off right now so ill have to start improving it a
5862616 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5862617 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5862618 we are in the midst of a fierce correction from a period of indiscriminate behaviour in the credit markets a surfeit of homebuilding a global avalanche of cheap labour and correspondingly cheap imports and other unsustainable financial and economic activity

5862621 the demand for loans is not there nor are banks willing to extend credit even if it were if this weakness becomes entrenched over the autumn it is a clear sign of very weak american output growth in 2009
5862622 it is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed
5862623 the issues raised in the report are currently being addressed by the governor and staff at frankland a new diversity and safer prisons manager is in post to ensure a focus on matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti bullying and diversity
5862624 two caucasian males one wouldnt guess theyd respond differently to drugs but we found that for one drug metabolising gene watsons dna indicated he was likely to respond to drugs differently
5862625 our number one pick in the mining sector is xstrata it trades on attractive 2009 estimated valuations has good exposure to coal and copper prices and is likely to continue to play an ongoing part in sector mergers and acquisition
5862626 there are several other platinum companies including aquarius platinum who are ripe for xstratas picking should the lonmin bid fail
5862627 the events of the past six months have highlighted the risks of being a single project company in kyrgyzstan the board is looking at a number of new initiatives as to how these risks can be best mitigated
5862628 we know that redistribution alone as the sole policy tool to tackle poverty has failed
5862629 there are 900 000 more people in severe poverty than in 1997 and child poverty has been rising for two years in succession
5862630 that approach is failing because it relies on a flawed assumption that only the state can guarantee fairness
5862631 in the 1970s people would have felt it was social death to go to an open day with their parent now its the norm
5862632 universities are increasingly and self consciously addressing parents as much as children in how they market themselves now they see it as a three way conversation with parents acting as advocates in the way that schools rather than universities are used to
5862633 the conventional explanation is that with parents paying more for their childs education they want a bigger say in it but i think it goes deeper than that
5862634 there is a powerful sense of infantilism where parents cant let go
5862635 i welcome the universities acknowledgement that its us as parents who pay the fees and we have a right to know whats going on and be involved
5862636 but weve got to be really really careful we dont take away the ability of youngsters to find their own responsibility university is about learning how to be independent and that should be protected
5862637 about one in 10 students have used the option our customer service tells us anecdotally that for the most part its when son or daughter has called their parent calls back to ask further questions
5862638 there are some of what you might call pushy parents using it with half a million applicants a year some are very very strong minded and independent and others want their parents to do the work for them
5862639 experts are telling us that the profile of fans that follow pete doherty and babyshambles is volatile and they can easily be whipped up into a frenzy whereas the profile of someone that would follow around cliff richard or bucks fizz for example is completely different
5862640 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd
5862641 they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting
5862642 hes very kindly offered a free gig for everyone who has bought a ticket and wont be able to see him
5862643 they told me privately they hate the fact he lives in wiltshire and they dont want him on their patch
5862644 people across the country not just in london can see for themselves that after just three months the new tory administration in london is in complete disarray
5862645 the mayor of london has been frank in his opposition to his leaders claim which has always been the most cynical nonsense
5862646 in doing so he has signalled that at least one senior conservative is fed up of david cameron running britain down
5862647 if youre going to take very important political decisions about london transport its absolutely vital the mayor chairs tfl and tim parker agrees with me that thats the way forward
5862648 his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one
5862649 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5862650 we are already in discussion with wwf about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future
5862651 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5862652 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5862653 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5862654 subject civil objects and civilians on the territory of georgia to deliberate attacks
5862655 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
5862656 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
5862657 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
5862658 he essentially came from a blues funk and rock corner and it was his ability to bring this attack to a jazz context that always seemed to be the defining factor
5862659 it was this that endeared him to artists like gil for instance although he played on countless sessions he was a great live performer and this is where he stood out whether with sanborn bley or gil evans
5862660 basically they poison me to kill the cancer then bring me back to health actually i guess that last part is on me i needed to lose some weight anyway
5862661 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers
5862662 e on does have investment in renewables and they are pushing forward this scheme we want them to go down this road and use that expertise and technology and stop cancelling it out by pushing forward a coal fired power station
5862663 emerge as a profound issue for our generation in britain
5862664 there are so many local water crises globally and when that comes together with climate change and population growth we are setting ourselves up for a real fall
5862665 people didnt realise what impact they would have on food and food prices weve had discussions with big retailers about water but because its not a globally traded commodity i dont think most have grasped the enormity of what is going on in their supply chains and the impact of drought on prices will they actually change them we have to ask are we exporting drought
5862666 brian i dont know what ill do if tarique becomes my deputy
5862667 i dont think it is something ian blair has ever forgotten
5862668 it was a devastating blow to the case ian blair was utterly furious with tarique he had no notice tarique would do that and it was clearly damaging it was at a critical time when blair was launching his bid for commissioner
5862669 he delivered excellent results he did in the end win people round
5862670 it would be seen as directly attacking the authority of the commissioner and cabinet collective responsibility
5862671 he came very close to not having his contract renewed
5862672 by the time he arrived at the unit he was already in the last chance saloon
5862673 tarique has added value to the force but hes reached his limit and does not realise that i realise that ive reached my limit hes brilliant at some things but just doesnt realise his weaknesses
5862674 the effect will be disastrous it represents a real setback for their race equality efforts internally
5862675 its going to be baptism by fire and it will really show us where our success is and also some areas in which we need to improve its a great opportunity for us and a great way to open the season
5862676 with all of our returning players we will have quite a bit of experience in pressure situations so that should be a strength for us
5862677 this is a tremendous freshmen class we are going to have anywhere between two and four freshman start
5862678 those that dont make the starting lineup are going to positively impact our team and as the season wares on they will have more and more of an impact overall this class has done very well and has added an exciting spin to our team
5862679 grace is a tremendous player she has unbelievable god given talents and i think this year will be better for her because she has added some pieces to her game shes been working very hard to be a multi talented attacking player
5862680 jane is a solid goalkeeper i think one of the better goalkeepers in the conference she has more experience which makes her a bit calmer in the back she will be a rock for us back there
5862681 did start work at 9am and worked about an hour but then was feeling very unmotivated and feeling down for some reason about everything
5862682 cant take anything at face value always assume there are bad intentions behind everything casey ever does

5862691 but doctors ran a series of tests that came up inconclusive i hadnt had it happen for awhile until last december in italy when i passed out roughly about the time my father passed away back in the states the incident in virginia felt similar to what has happened in the past i have to thank my techs alan brian and good friend chief for catching me

5862696 we thought it was not a good time with tensions running as high as they do to publish this
5862697 this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
5862698 i cannot in good conscience let misleading ballot statements stand when the facts clearly indicate otherwise
5862699 by clear implication it makes reference to the activities of the rancho santa margarita city council members
5862700 my honest opinion is that im relieved that it was challenged
5862701 i am sorry for any confusion this misstatement has caused and appreciate residents continued support of family matters and my campaign for city council

5862708 education system is in crisis and failing the youth of today
5862709 the rest of the emerging world recognises this is the key to staying competitive
5862710 its time our political leaders acknowledged that and declare there is a crisis and do something about it
5862711 every country i visit recognises the importance of education and striving to raise their level of educational capability
5862712 if you look at eastern europe china russia india latin america there is an increasing focus on education government leaders see that their competitiveness and the future of their country depends on the quality of their workforce and the education of their young people
5862713 we in the us have to recognise that and its not just the us japan the uk and western europe have the same challenges going forward
5862714 personal computers arent magic they are just a tool what you need to make the educational process work is a good teacher who is knowledgeable in the subject and can get kids excited
5862715 there is such an immense amount of technology that can do such an immense amount of good around the world
5862716 it works great as an educational tool and i know some schools have a class project to make pens and now they have around 30 electronic systems where this is used
5862717 so far we have affected 600 000 peoples lives and its allowing people to start a water sanitation business working mothers to start a seamstress business and people to start rice farms
5862718 my teachers were great educators with great after school programmes and pushing us to go beyond what we were doing
5862719 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5862720 bottom up development by concentrating on micro finance vocational training and community development programs
5862721 to continue the andean counter drug program and update it to meet evolving challenges we will fully support colombias fight against the farc well work with the government to end the reign of terror from right wing paramilitaries we will support colombias right to strike terrorists who seek safe haven across its borders and we will shine a light on any support for the farc that comes from neighboring governments this behavior must be exposed to international condemnation regional isolation and if need be strong sanctions
5862722 its time for a new alliance of the americas after eight years of the failed policies of the past we need new leadership for the future after decades pressing for top down reform we need an agenda that advances democracy security and opportunity from the bottom up so my policy towards the americas will be guided by the simple principle that whats good for the people of the americas is good for the united states
5862723 whats good for the people of the americas is good for the united states

5862725 a integridade territorial da ge rgia dentro das suas fronteiras internacionalmente reconhecidas
5862726 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5862727 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5862728 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
5862729 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5862730 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5862731 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5862732 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5862733 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5862734 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5862735 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5862736 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5862737 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5862738 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5862739 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5862740 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5862741 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
5862742 most of the damage has really been limited to the heavy rainfall

5862801 earlier the bpps trustees called akabars were chosen by the 3 000 member anjuman committee
5862802 the institution governs the community and hence there should be a greater degree of transparency
5862803 they should make the right to information act applicable wherever required for greater transparency
5862804 it is a contentious community and they have done the best they could however there was a lot of dissent among the trustees and the coming election might help change that
5862805 we are also an ageing community over 40 per cent of parsis are aged over 50
5862806 talks are just at a preliminary stage rane is interested but has not revealed his cards yet
5862807 rane is not the kind of person who would accept defeat and allow himself to be humiliated forever
5862808 we have to see which of the two parties has the best candidates on them
5862809 endangering peace and communal harmony in the region and the country
5862810 direct dangerous and provocative interference in the internal affairs of the khalsa panth and attempts to destroy the mini parliament of sikhs
5862811 or else she would be directly responsible for any unpleasant consequences that come from her pursuing this disastrous course
5862812 that spate of violence itself was the result of the dangerous political conspiracies of the then congress leaders at the centre and in the state
5862813 it seems they are hell bent on re activating those conspiracies
5862814 i have told him that hooda is overturning the jawaharlal nehru master tara singh pact which guaranteed that there would be no interference in the internal affairs of sikhs
5862815 i also said the responsibility for the consequences of hoodas actions would lie fully with the congress
5862816 he said he would ask the home minister to speak to the chief minister
5862817 his practice increased day by day you would never find him arguing small cases he would always represent the big fish be it a service matter or a civil appeal
5862818 yesterday we issued lookout notices against bansal and a delhi businessman ravinder singh but both of them have failed to turn up so far and join investigations
5862819 we are shocked to learn that parkash had been arrested he was a dedicated worker and enjoyed a good reputation in the high court
5862820 it is going to broaden the base of the state administration and accelerate the process of development
5862821 according to the law the state government is competent to create districts blocks and sub divisions
5862822 instead of tendering resignations they were moving around in beacon light fitted cars and taking vital decisions
5862823 i want the chief minister to answer the basis of selection of these candidates we will not make any allegation at this stage but if the cm fails to give convincing replies we will find the answer
5862824 although the body was recovered from inside the room no suicide note was found

5862827 we are getting support from the bjp congress and national conference here we would like the movement to be this way this peoples movement is a battle between nationalists and anti nationals

5862829 we would welcome support from everyone whether its swami ramdev or chaitanya maharaj

5862831 spending all day lounging on a cell bunk on the other hand particularly for those on short sentences is the real soft option
5862832 this handbook reveals the extent of excellent work being done across the country in community sentencing
5862833 community programmes are tailored to individuals and their circumstances tackling the underlying causes of crime and seeking to challenge and change people for the better
5862834 community sentences can be tougher and more effective than short term custodial sentences for some offenders
5862835 thats why the positive role community sentences can play as demonstrated in the howard leagues report is very welcome
5862836 we have a duty to ensure that we provide punishments which are most effective in cutting re offending and the truth is for many offenders community sentences are more effective in cutting re offending than short term prison sentences and we need to ensure the public have confidence that this is fact
5862837 hundreds of pakistani civilians have been killed in suicide bombings over 1 000 pakistani troops have been killed fighting militants and musharraf himself has been the target of at least half a dozen assassination attempts
5862838 yet in pakistans tribal belt from where the helmand insurgency is being directed a new pakistani taliban now amasses suspected of the assassination of benazir bhutto last year
5862839 and pakistani inter services intelligence which introduced osama bin laden to the taliban in 1996 continues selectively to manipulate misdirect and frustrate western intelligence efforts in the region
5862840 use of nrt during pregnancy is controversial because nrt contains one of the toxins in tobacco smoke and not much is known about the safety of nrt use during pregnancy
5862841 most women tend to be sensible when they are pregnant and work hard at adopting healthier lifestyles
5862842 giving up on tobacco can be difficult as it is addictive but there are ways to manage the cravings during this period
5862843 i think there will be a cut next month of 0 25 of a per cent and probably another one in november
5862844 and i think probably there will be another three rate reductions next year
5862845 having said this we are currently considering options for the future provision of public pet ct services in tasmania
5862846 a final decision on the governments approach to public pet ct services will be made following detailed consideration of all options
5862847 from the beginning i have stressed we needed to follow due process in line with the relevant legislation
5862848 under the hospitals act ministerial approval was required for an alteration of the scale the hobart private hospital was proposing
5862849 the hospital formally sought approval for the mia tasmania pet on july 9 however the department required additional information which was received on august 1
5862850 i have since approved the plans along with certain conditions relating to patient safety and quality
5862851 in light of this timeline i dont believe there is any basis for accusations that we sat on our hands or deliberately delayed
5862852 we acted to ensure the administrative processes were followed in accordance with the law the tasmanian public would expect nothing less
5862853 the site must also be accredited by the australian and new zealand association of physicians in nuclear medicine as a site for advanced training in pet
5862854 appropriately credentialed staff are also required and mia will need to ensure patients are fully aware of the costs of their scan prior to the procedure by obtaining informed financial consent
5862855 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
5862856 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
5862857 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
5862858 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
5862859 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
5862860 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
5862861 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
5862862 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
5862863 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off
5862864 id like to hear a response plan from each agency on a nessie esque beast in the water reservoirs assume it is dangerous eating skinny dippers dragging dogs underwater etc
5862865 drastic measures to be implemented in order to keep bull run water pristine
5862866 be it man woman or beast the portland water bureau will stop at nothing to deliver you clean cold cheap and constant drinking water every single day
5862867 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of
5862868 what is the cookie diet that sounds like a nice dream
5862869 you dont wanna play all the new songs live but with technology these days therell be someone out there with a recorder and it kinda spoils it for us
5862870 learn three chords on the guitar and go write a tune
5862871 i just wanted him to know that im actually taking guitar lessons from jay z right now and hes already taught me both chords to wonderwall tune
5862872 mostly were hoping to gather women in roughly the same timezone together
5862873 and wed also like to make sure the most active volunteers from both chapters are in regular contact as we have one major joint event each year the linuxchix miniconference at linux conf au and members of each chapter not infrequently visit the other country on business
5862874 im very pleased with the increased numbers of women in open source in recent years and with them has come an increased sense of women in open source being a normal thing
5862875 i hope more linux and open source women users are welcomed into the development and advocacy communities it is also an increasingly good source of it skills and employment and i want more women to take advantage of that
5862876 their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5862877 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5862878 there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5862879 the change may mean more assessments of the situation but time is running out to stage the event or move it elsewhere
5862880 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan whereas the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5862881 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
5862882 rise of the argonauts is an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
5862883 were not really going to compete with all the pop bands coming out over christmas were not worried though its going to be good
5862884 we just hope that as these protesters get arrested as we think some of them will that their rights are fully protected and make sure that the city is staffed with as many well trained attorneys as possible so we can make sure everyones constitutional rights are safe
5862885 a lot of people arent happy with the direction the country is going and this is a chance to be there when people are trying to make a change
5862886 and when you look over history and think this should be one of those moments and to be there to help people however you can help them so they can do that
5862887 this is what a lot of people have gone to law school for
5862888 were talking about some of the most fundamental rights the freedom of speech is what the country was founded on and this is a chance to be part of that
5862889 in the last 30 years this work was done by just a few lawyers and we had bigger than an average crowd
5862890 and these are people from all walks of representation so something is inspiring people to get involved and i hope its social change
5862891 even by bootleg standards the audio quality is really really bad
5862892 you really couldnt hear anything it was like something that was playing four or five rooms away being recorded it really is a bit of a non event
5862893 like the movie smashed we all saw what can happen when a good person and athlete makes a bad decision and drives after drinking lawson writes
5862894 one of our tennis players here hit two students and hurt them after driving his car and drinking the girls are in the hospital and hopefully will be ok but they were hurt just walking down the street
5862895 he has had to leave school lose his scholarship and give up all the years of training and hard work he and his parents have done to make him a scholarship athlete he now faces serious criminal charges that will cost he and his family a lot and will be with him the rest of his life hopefully the girls will recover but it will be hard for them too because they are out of school while they recover and the teammates of chris will be hurt too the have a great team and will now be missing one of their star players
5862896 i have learned a lot from this experience and know that i will never drink and drive lawson writes
5862897 one of the things i have learned from this is that if we are going to party we need to have someone with us that can help make good choices
5862898 i did drugs for 18 years and i never got that bad as to say you know what i think the kaiser chiefs are brilliant
5862899 when i was 17 and noel was going on about blur i was watching it and now im 30 and hes 50 and hes talking about us
5862900 theres a lot of stuff regarding him and kates relationship theres a lot of stuff regarding his view on the no shows his view on drugs his view on the arrests and persecution relationships with band members
5862901 oh we suck we suck mightily we are flawed and we are very harmless to the rest of the league
5862902 it can be said in some quarters without immediate fear of rousing the manteno whitecoats that with the speed and fielding up the gut the power on the corners and the surprising level of success of some of the baby pitchers weve been casting out there as bait that there is hope for next year given the right trades and free agent signings like either or those will ever happen but bear with me here
5862903 desperate for employees and will be for years to come
5862904 well i like salmon so why not blend it and drink it
5862905 its mainly for men who are exhausted by the summers heat
5862906 we caused sars and well eat anything with four legs that isnt a table
5862907 can you go across the street and get me some pizza
5862908 now what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth
5862909 lag chugging frame rates and poor system performance in general are nuisances every online pc gamer has to deal with
5862910 by lowering the price of the k1 bigfoot has put relief from client side lag within reach of more gamers than ever before
5862911 this is an exciting time in the ongoing development of archlord archlord has never been more popular with almost 750 000 players now playing with this number increasing almost 20 000 new players each week archlord is going from strength to strength and we are assessing the need right now to open new servers just to cope with the increased levels of demand for this great free mmorpg
5862912 more than becoming the standard for creating immersive games nvidia is as dedicated as emergent to delivering the tools runtimes and technologies needed to radically improve the state of development
5862913 both companies are committed to platform agnostic flexible modular solutions that harness the power of multi core multi threaded development with nvidias deep support for these values we will offer the industry the most powerful flexible and easiest development environment available to push the edge of video game technology and creativity
5862914 we are delighted to be building a fusion of our physx technology and the gamebryo engine
5862915 the combination will provide developers a unique platform for introducing the world to their creative vision and technology innovation
5862916 its a cartoon the movie is a cartoon to me i dont know what everybody else is gonna think it is but to me its a cartoon i mean we do wile e coyote kind of stuff you know i hit him in the head with a toilets weve got wrenches as big as this room bam i hit him with the wrench and he gets up were both pretty much indestructible and i created him so i know hes indestructible and then i use the stuff on myself and make myself indestructible were the only two people that are like that so we do outrageous things to each other i mean even when i get shot at i shake bullets out of my head its a cartoon its so kind of outrageous and crazy and over the top i get to wear all these outrageous costumes i mean come on i dress up like a nazi in this film its kind of cool i get lightning bolt eyebrows its fun
5862917 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5862918 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5862919 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5862920 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5862921 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
5862922 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5862923 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5862924 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5862925 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing
5862926 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5862927 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5862928 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5862929 what these figures tell us is that this is definitely something that we need to look at more closely to discover why this is happening
5862930 but it is impossible on the basis of these figures alone to say why this should be the case in lothian
5862931 we placed our participants in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
5862932 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realising that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth
5862933 finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
5862934 this is why books and movies work they stimulate the area of the brain which is involved in what it really feels like to be disgusted
5862935 edinburghs world heritage site is very important and it is crucial that its outstanding features are preserved and protected
5862936 i am a bit concerned about the caltongate development i saw for myself the site of the development during my tour and was told not to worry too much about the impact it will have but the big concern will be how it affects the historic skyline
5862937 the debates about new developments are not just happening in edinburgh but we are opposed to anything which would impact on the citys skyline modern high rises should not be built in historic city centres or in areas where they would have a significant impact nothing else should be decided on these schemes until our inspectors have visited and reported back
5862938 were not supportive of unnecessary delays in the planning decisions that hold up major investment decisions being made that are important to the economic health of edinburgh and scotland
5862939 our proposals have been referred to the scottish government following approval from the council in june historic scotland the agency charged with safeguarding the nations historic environment had no objections
5862940 we dont feel we have a part to play in this process any more
5862941 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against terrorism for democracy and freedom the cause is just
5862942 little has been done to address impunity within the security forces and armed groups or to reform the justice sector
5862943 peace social reconstruction justice and reconciliation remain distant dreams in congo
5862944 fewer than half the people surveyed felt safe sleeping walking at night in their village or meeting strangers
5862945 continue to be among the worst perpetrators of daily human rights violations against the population and the source of instability
5862946 including killing torture displacement abduction and epidemic levels of rape
5862947 a state of fear prevails to this day in large swathes
5862948 reform of the police and army are needed immediately to protect civilians the congolese expect that war criminals will be punished but most remain at large
5862949 these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the partys ability to continue as a going concern
5862950 the partys auditors have confirmed that the party is indeed a going concern the deficit of 22 000 occurred in a double election year when the demands of the partys campaign operation were significantly high
5862951 this is an entirely manageable deficit which the partys bankers have confirmed they will support
5862952 the scottish liberal democrats are already taking steps to improve our long term income position
5862953 the only way we can do this is by offering distinctive policies choice and image that people can buy into both in terms of membership and party donations
5862954 we need to put this in perspective its not a major problem but it would be better if our books balanced on the right side rather than the wrong one
5862955 not only are polls showing that the scottish liberal democrat leadership contenders are invisible to the public but it looks like the eventual successor to nicol stephen may even inherit an invisible party
5862956 it further underlines the blunder they made in taking to the back benches in a huff after last years holyrood election
5862957 the point is we have a lot more money coming in and assets to cover our debt
5862958 our purpose in getting this outdated exemption lifted was to ensure that the same baseline standard is applied to all caravan sites in angus so everyone has the same degree of protection in terms of health and safety
5862959 what these new standards would do is make it clear to accommodation providers exactly what standard they now must achieve to get a licence
5862960 it would also demonstrate to our migrant workforce that we have taken all measures available to us to ensure their living accommodation is of an acceptable standard
5862961 the legislation governing the type of accommodation being provided is in some instances out of date and inconsistent and the type of accommodation being provided does not sit comfortably with any of the existing areas of regulation
5862962 we have advertisement determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5862963 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5862964 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5862965 barry was a devoted husband and father he has died doing a job he loved his family and the army were his life he will be forever missed by his wife children and family he will never be forgotten he died a hero
5862966 always calm and professional he was naturally suited to a medical career and planned to continue progressing in this area
5862967 barry was a stalwart of the medical centre a hard worker he always volunteered for any task and was always at the centre of the team motivating and encouraging the younger medics
5862968 on learning the news of his passing the battle group paused to remember this fine man and brave colleague
5862969 we gathered around our simple stone memorial prayed for him his wife son and daughter back in edinburgh when we all return home we will mourn him properly
5862970 i was extremely saddened to hear of the death of cpl dempsey
5862971 he was a selfless and brave professional putting himself in harms way to provide the very best of medical care to his colleagues and afghans alike
5862972 my thoughts are with his family friends and regiment at this very difficult time
5862973 they are probably trying to impress each other by showing what they can do and what a strong impressive dolphin they are
5862974 we are dealing with very social animals that are living in societies and have high levels of intelligence
5862975 it is encouraging that these figures show scotland has recorded its best ever performance in cutting cancer waiting times but we can and must do more
5862976 these figures show more needs to be done to reduce waiting times for bowel cancer patients in scotland
5862977 the amount of time that people have to wait is very important to them it can be very stressful and distressing for them to wait long periods
5862978 im absolutely not a heroic figure im a comic figure
5862979 i think these kinds of things can be approached quite well through comedy
5862980 because one of the good things about the ealing comedies is that the great imperial ambitions of the 1950s had a darkly surreal illogical nature id be interested in trying to get that across
5862981 im a bit ambivalent about it i think what my books are really about is my sense in afghanistan of what culture outside kabul seems to be like for a foreigner and in iraq to talk about why the coalition was so unsuccessful and the project so doomed
5862982 i try to keep myself out of the books i dont talk about my own personality or life im not quite sure how this could work
5862983 if it was something that was able to draw attention to the work of the charity in kabul it would be exciting
5862984 what you notice working in these countries is the amazing jargon of bureaucracies the water cooler politics if you were able to convey that in a film get over a culture of powerpoint presentation you would begin to show an audience why something could be a catastrophe without reducing it to saying everyone there is evil or stealing money or stupid
5862985 the term schoolmaster is the name given to a horse that has such a temperament that it is safe to be ridden by children
5862986 miss murray bought the horse for 2 000 she was not given a horse passport but was told it would be sent to her
5862987 the purchaser soon discovered the horse was not as presented and came to the conclusion that the horse was much too excitable to be safe for her daughter to ride she contacted the accused and told her she would be returning the horse
5862988 the effect of these letters was to support the accuseds assertion that pepsi was a proper schoolmaster and to discredit the pursuer as irresponsible in the way she returned the horse
5862989 the facts of this case show natalie whittington davies is a thoroughly irreputable and dishonest individual who has no respect for the court and appears to have little or no concerns to the risks attached to young people riding horses
5862990 he gave his evidence with a degree of fortitude in due course however it is likely that he will be confined to the house and latterly to bed requiring total care
5862991 this final period may require to be spent in hospital or in a hospice he and his wife live with his father in law and his sister in law
5862992 mr and mrs renfrew moved there after her mother died in 2005 until recently she worked five days a week
5862993 not standing is not a crime different thinking is no crime
5862994 it was just another campaign t shirt that i wore to help my activist friends
5862995 engaging in highly public and controversial political activity on tv
5862996 were looking forward to chris hoys triumphant return to the city hes a true local hero and an open top bus parade to celebrate his and his fellow athletes success would be fantastic
5862997 i think the people of edinburgh would come out in force and line the city streets to celebrate that success so were looking forward to speaking to chris to see what he thinks well also be in touch with sportscotland and scottish cycling to make plans
5862998 sportscotland is extremely proud of all of scotlands 32 representatives on team gb we are working with all partners to ensure homecoming celebrations for the athletes who have won medals so far recognise the magnitude of their sporting achievements and in particular those of chris hoy scotlands greatest ever olympian
5862999 this is something we want to do to celebrate scotlands achievements we want to get the best route planned so that the maximum number of people can come and cheer on our athletes
5863000 an open top parade is the best opportunity we can give for the people of edinburgh to come out and congratulate chris hoy and the rest of the scottish athletes
5863001 the scottish government is investigating what can be done for our returning athletes
5863002 we have a variety of options for a public celebration but plans are in their infancy at the moment
5863003 the idea is that scotlands young talent can rub shoulders with established olympians and learn from them
5863004 it will be a great opportunity for the stars of tomorrow to speak to the likes of chris hoy and gain some valuable experience
5863005 she is a very successful person in her own right whether she is a mother or not
5863006 people need to recognise that she has been appointed chief executive because she is that good
5863007 ive only been able to achieve what i have because of people who support me superwoman i laugh that one off
5863008 avoiding companies run by men with beards or too much jewellery
5863009 although shes not that old she is a very experienced person and has held a number of senior positions she has been referred to as katherine the great and she has a strong media profile
5863010 there are not many scottish ftse 100 companies and shes the head of one of them if thats the yardstick she must be one of scotlands most influential business leaders
5863011 my relationships with the edinburgh festival are shaken to the foundation by the idea of the rooms being turned into shops
5863012 significant loss to the fringe and the wider cultural and artistic reputation of edinburgh
5863013 when it reopens assembly theatre will have lost at least three performance spaces the wildman room the supper room and the edinburgh suite along with the club bar
5863014 we operate on a very tight financial model and the building in its new guise will not be commercially viable
5863015 its a very prestigious venue and if you are going to bring someone over from america for the killer first show you want to go somewhere very respectable it still has that image though it may not be cutting edge for all new comedy
5863016 businesses that use the venue in the past have said it is in need of refurbishment we do feel this is the right way forward for the city and the assembly rooms
5863017 this will enhance its use not just in the four weeks of the festival period but throughout the whole year
5863018 you cross the line and all the pressure and expectation evaporates and its like nothing else youve ever felt
5863019 its about the process and the performance breaking it down to the technical elements thats why the emotions come out at the end it just erupts out of you
5863020 he has from an early age been heavily into cycling at the expense of going out with his mates
5863021 he drinks orange juice and goes home early that makes him sound boring but hes not he just sets himself a goal and goes all out to achieve it
5863022 chris was a superb all round athlete but cycling was what really caught his imagination
5863023 the global economic downturn is affecting economies across the world and clearly scotland cannot be fully insulated from its effects
5863024 but there are two reasons why the economic outlook for scotland is positive
5863025 first the scottish economy continues to show encouraging signs of resilience second scotland has a government that despite its limited economic powers will take decisive action to strengthen our performance and prospects
5863026 we will not simply sit back and wait for conditions to get better
5863027 that is why we have published the next steps for our housing policy and why up to 100 million capital spending will be brought forward to support these efforts and help us meet demand for affordable housing
5863028 as part of the full programme we are announcing to meet the immediate economic challenges promote growth and support business confidence this investment will help us maintain scotlands reputation as europes place of the future
5863029 the snps credit is low after disappointing first time buyers by failing to deliver on its promise to provide 2 000 grants and now deliberately setting out to mislead the public that they are providing new money
5863030 while the sfha believes there should be more funding overall for housing we welcome the scottish governments decision to bring forward the allocated funding and give a key role to housing associations
5863031 this gives local authorities greater flexibility and recognises that housing associations are best placed to meet the needs of the affordable housing sector
5863032 this is important at a time when demand for affordable housing options is likely to increase as the credit crunch increasingly hits consumers and mortgage lending
5863033 unite believe that both the employers and the scottish government have a duty to intervene to end this damaging dispute and to stop placing the burden of inflation on the lowest paid workers by making the necessary funds available
5863034 i approached employers through cosla asking them to meet us to see if there was some way they could look at the offer but i am very disappointed i had no response
5863035 we made an offer in good faith which was in line with inflation when we made it and which was at the top of what councils could afford
5863036 we want to ensure that everyone who uses relies on or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them
5863037 labour in edinburgh cannot now cry crocodile tears for the loss of post offices they voted to axe
5863038 scottish labour mps have consistently backed the uk governments policy which has led to these closures so it is a bit rich that they are now feigning outrage and concern
5863039 myself and my colleagues are determined to fight these changes that will effectively butcher postal services across the region
5863040 our experiences show that regardless of how good an argument you put forward the decisions have been made you may save one post office but another will be closed down the road
5863041 i do regret it when people say that consultations are futile because my evidence is that they are not
5863042 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5863043 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5863044 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5863045 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence

5863049 tayside police can confirm that 47 year old joseph herbert millbank has been traced in st tropez in france this afternoon
5863050 millbank had been missing from his address in perth since 27 june tayside police quickly established that he had travelled to france and alerted interpol the french authorities traced him in st tropez at about 2 30pm
5863051 it is understood that millbank will now appear in court in france after which time the crown office and the procurator fiscal service will instigate extradition proceedings
5863052 east asians focus more on the central region of faces to extract information in a holistic global fashion
5863053 was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
5863054 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
5863055 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity chief turner said
5863056 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5863057 to add stronger more prominent warnings in the product label
5863058 while i am appreciative of the interest shown i have decided not to allow my name to go forward
5863059 i hope this will end the speculation and allow the party to concentrate on the selection of the candidate and retaining the seat for labour
5863060 scotland has moved on the constituency has moved on and i have moved on
5863061 i feel i have assumed a new role in public life which allows me to work in a number of ways for the future of scotland
5863062 i believe i can be of value to scotland and the labour party from a position outwith elected service
5863063 these are challenging times but despite recent setbacks i am confident glenrothes remains a winnable seat for labour
5863064 both in the constituency and in the wider arena i will be happy to provide what support i can

5863069 those expenditures are worthwhile but they were not what the lottery was intended for and were now seeing that organisations like sport england are having cuts in their budgets
5863070 if that were to be a continuing position it would severely damage the future facilities that could be made available
5863071 without the facilities at local level for young people theyre not going to be drawn into the sport
5863072 money is the root of all progress and it needs to be continued
5863073 ive been up every morning at 6am to watch it and i bet millions of other people have
5863074 i dare say im not the only person to shed a tear or two of sheer delight when weve seen our young men and women
5863075 if we can produce more rebecca adlingtons more beckhams more kenneth branaghs in the arts then i think the whole country benefits
5863076 people in different parts of the world eat lizards and dogs why not rats

5863087 the safety of the players the fans and the media have got to be taken into consideration
5863088 but its important to play the game no matter where
5863089 we say that we start on the first course and then we think about eating the other courses one thing at a time this match is an important test for our players we have to believe that we are a strong team like the stars of italy spain or england
5863090 were in a tough qualifying group but we have to take responsibility as individuals and as a team
5863091 like anything it will take a bit of time to understand each other ive settled in well at liverpool and im enjoying it
5863092 well tell him thank you very much it is a very nice compliment
5863093 heavy rainfall and consequential flooding are not a new phenomenon and while of course the impact of climate change on the levels of rainfall in ireland is something that needs to be tackled the fact of the matter is that the damage from the flooding in the last few weeks has been so bad because a complete lack of preparedness
5863094 at the current rate of expenditure it will take about two decades for the government to complete its current programme this will leave towns like carlow continuing to bear the brunt of the governments lack of commitment in preparing for flood events
5863095 the lack of urgency from the government is shocking when so many homes businesses and communities are in danger
5863096 figures show that the government is spending very little on flood defence at a time when the risk is greater than ever
5863097 as far back as october 2000 the european council established a framework for community action on water policy which requires river basin management plans to be developed for each river basin district in order to achieve good ecological and chemical status
5863098 we should be doing all in our power to promote integration rather than separation
5863099 i find it incredible that after 10 years of net immigration into ireland of families and children from all over the world the government is still waiting on the publication of reports and research before it decides on the best approach for teaching immigrant children in our schools
5863100 what has the department of education been doing for the past decade if it finds itself unable to provide clear guidelines on this important matter
5863101 this doesnt affect the flight though it may create problems booking hotels in a new venue
5863102 well go where we have to but for now all we can do is wait for the fai to tell us where we have to fly to
5863103 recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5863104 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa union of european football associations also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5863105 it is considered that the design height and scale of the proposed development which lacks context in relation to the landscape layout and historic built fabric of and surrounding the site would result in an inappropriate form of development
5863106 materially and adversely affect the character and setting of the protected structures and would detract from the townscape of cashel in particular in views from the rock of cashel
5863107 would not injure or interfere with the medieval town defences of cashel
5863108 would therefore be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area
5863109 io credo che da qualche parte vaghino le anime irrequiete
5863110 notable deterioration in consumer sentiment in the uk since june
5863111 by this afternoon the course was drying up nicely but then we had 5mm of rain in a sharp downpour that put us right back where we were
5863112 we are looking at options for thursday and friday and still hopeful of racing if we get 24 hours of drying conditions we are also considering the option of racing on saturday and going through the logistics and implications of that
5863113 ebor week is probably the fifth biggest of the year in terms of betting turnover
5863114 tuesdays card alone might have been expected to generate off course turnover of 40m while wednesdays meeting was a seven race card including one of the biggest betting heats of the year
5863115 it has a knock on effect on the other meetings too if york is off people simply dont come into the shops so they are not betting on anything else either
5863116 we have an embarrassment of riches at the ebor festival with both handicaps and pattern races
5863117 and it is not a case of putting one against another at this stage we are examining all the options in conjunction with the british horseracing authority
5863118 we walked the course on monday afternoon and it was raceable
5863119 with a forecast for light patchy showers and rain that might miss us
5863120 whose love and compassion and huge feeling for the person who got a hard hand in life oozed through his voice
5863121 in a way he elevated the words of songs to become a sacred mantra
5863122 it would not be dads funeral without there having been a slight edge
5863123 you couldnt see ronnie drew having a po faced funeral
5863124 who had the unenviable job of shaving his head and beard
5863125 we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams one man with a dream at pleasure shall go forth and conquer a crown and three with a new songs measure can trample an empire down
5863126 what would you do if you earned a million a week
5863127 sad solemn notes and cases of newly drawn stout the usual symptoms when a light goes out
5863128 what keeps me here is the rake o beer the women an the craic
5863129 its a good project that will allow us to continue to operate for many more years a plant that is safe a plant that will produce electricity at a competitive price
5863130 its a good business decision for the regional economy as well as for the rest of quebec
5863131 our estimate derives from eight years of feasibility studies evaluation preparatory work and inspections
5863132 generally in the nuclear world a lot of it doesnt have to do with economics and more to with the prestige of having a nuclear facility
5863133 frankly 2 billion for 600 megawatts is quite a lot
5863134 the government has had a policy that wont accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5863135 today however they have given the ok to producing more radioactive waste thats hypocritical
5863136 it usually takes 40 years for the radiation to subside enough to get near it
5863137 theyre going to stop the reactor and send the workers in right after they say there is no danger but thats completely false
5863138 at the core of all of this is what it means to be a public broadcaster
5863139 and that is to provide programming for all canadians and to reflect the arts and culture scene in canada and to reflect canada back to canadians
5863140 so cbc is greatly compressing that kind of music which you could call serious music into a listening ghetto of 10 a m to 3 p m
5863141 i say ghetto just because they know anybody who looks at the numbers knows that the available audience between 10 and 3 is very small compared with mornings or evenings or the drive home or drive to work period
5863142 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5863143 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5863144 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5863145 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5863146 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5863147 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the centre of it
5863148 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5863149 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5863150 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5863151 its a good project that will allow us to continue to operate for many more years a plant that is safe a plant that will produce electricity at a competitive price
5863152 its a good business decision for the regional economy as well as for the rest of quebec
5863153 our estimate derives from eight years of feasibility studies evaluation preparatory work and inspections
5863154 generally in the nuclear world a lot of it doesnt have to do with economics and more to with the prestige of having a nuclear facility
5863155 frankly 2 billion for 600 megawatts is quite a lot
5863156 the government has had a policy that wont accept a used fuel waste site in quebec
5863157 today however they have given the ok to producing more radioactive waste thats hypocritical
5863158 it usually takes 40 years for the radiation to subside enough to get near it
5863159 theyre going to stop the reactor and send the workers in right after they say there is no danger but thats completely false
5863160 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents and
5863161 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5863162 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5863163 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5863164 and thats how we get competitive in the indianas and virginias
5863165 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
5863166 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
5863167 the big difference this year is not the technology its the coordination
5863168 hey look at this surprising development the guy with more money is being outspent because hes foolishly and riskily airing tv ads in lesser battlegrounds
5863169 patrick got it right when he argued during the campaign that rather than debating whether we should raise or lower taxes we should first consider what we want to do and then discuss how to pay for it in that spirit those of us who were with him from the beginning are saying that it is time to talk
5863170 one reason these progressives are feeling marginalized might lie in their lack of unanimity on the issues it was easy to feel united and effective on an issue like gay marriage says boston progressive politician matt omalley because all the progressive groups were working together on it its been hard to find other issues that bring the left together in the same way that leaves progressives often splintered working at cross purposes or fighting losing causes
5863171 he hardly ever challenged my viewpoint or engaged me in real conversation
5863172 i was looking for someone whod be quieter and just listen
5863173 i know im being impatient but how long do i have to stay depressed for
5863174 i know youre feeling this way but you need to give it time
5863175 im also impatient by nature and it makes total sense that youre feeling impatient about getting better lets work together to do everything we can to move forward of course therell be times when things feel like theyre stuck or even getting worse but well join forces to make headways and if for any reason we see were not moving forward well explore all other options and see what we can do
5863176 i know the first step is going to be to eliminate the electricity and then were going to focus more on it being a set fire
5863177 why would i be ignorant i mean i have nothing to gain
5863178 i own the real estate theres no insurance on the building so i have nothing to gain out of it
5863179 the government picks health plans then we have to pick a plan from their list
5863180 our community believes its very important to move on an agenda of health care reform
5863181 i think it shows that the american people are coming together
5863182 those who were opposed to health care reform in the past now know its critically important
5863183 every human being should have the right to make their own reproductive health choices
5863184 every human being should have the right to make their own reproductive health choices
5863185 oh oh not today were two weeks away it just doesnt make sense for me to say on aug 19 who is going to be the shortstop on sept 1 it doesnt make sense lowrie has done a great job were thrilled to death it just doesnt make to do something when we dont need to
5863186 we support a womans right to have children this right is not dependent on income and we recognize the necessity for pre and post natal care health care economic supports and affordable high quality child care
5863187 nobody can really pay for it unless youre a billionaire
5863188 people that are committing these crimes are speeding out of parking lots endangering pedestrians inside the businesses
5863189 i have friends that have the smaller mom and pop services stations that dont have the financial backing or the mechanics to follow this ordinance
5863190 if the customers are required to pay before they pump then the opportunity to steal gas is eliminated
5863191 the rest of the field is made up of individuals and teams that are weekend warriors and run for the challenge and for fun but arent necessarily out to win
5863192 we wont run for pride we wont run for glory we
5863193 miles is coming back and obviously hes going to be on the team
5863194 we expect him to play this year so it doesnt really affect your numbers as far as the team overall you keep the best 53 players as long as you have enough and i think we have enough wide receivers to be a strong group
5863195 we made the decision to do what we did for the reasons we said we did general manager bruce allen and the league office have that information again i think a lot of luke petitgout i think he can come back and play he just has to get right
5863196 the coaches advised me exactly of whats going on im the role guy if a tackle should go down i jump in if an end should go down i jump in i play all four positions its a challenge but its a new role for me its a little different but thats where you have to really check your ego because you realize theres something bigger than just yourself you have to put the team first
5863197 taking advantage of somebodys sorrow and another persons generosity is just disgusting
5863198 would be donated to a cause or causes that were dear to timothys heart
5863199 anything around that homicide is not subject to be discussed right now i cant confirm specific complaints to the rcmp
5863200 its an area where there can be a lot of scammers predators and misinformation with no basis in fact
5863201 i just couldnt believe how humble and down to earth he was it was like i was sitting beside one of my friends just shooting the breeze
5863202 hes not a cocky guy hes just like you or me hes approachable and easy to talk to theres not a bad thing you could say about this guy
5863203 he was telling me that he wants to see what he can do on the world poker tour after these olympics another dream would be the world series of poker
5863204 trade in the gold medals for gold bracelets i guess
5863205 its one of the best things ive seen in my life
5863206 i feel real fortunate to have met him in person and that he would know me to say hey man michael phelps knowing who i am cool
5863207 game is a little off right now so ill have to start improving it a little bit
5863208 were obviously very concerned about much of what russia has been doing lately
5863209 when we see a russian bear approaching canadian air space we meet them with an f 18
5863210 we remind them that this is canadian air space that this is canadian sovereign air space and they turn back and we are going to continue to do that to demonstrate that we are watching closely their activities here
5863211 its a strong statement that says that russia must respect the territorial integrity of georgia and obviously we must all respect this integrity for all of the countries of the un
5863212 obviously i believe the message in general of this statement is that its not business as usual with nato and russia and this is a very important incident
5863213 i said last week that it indicates a philosophy that is soviet and that is unacceptable for canada
5863214 unfortunately we appear to be entering a new era of relations with russia
5863215 that is again something that we will be taking very close stock of day to day as we watch things progress in georgia but also in other regions including the canadian arctic
5863216 operational radius of russias northern submarine fleet and reinforce the russian armys combat readiness along the arctic coast
5863217 i would say that from a canadian forces standpoint we have to secure the north from anyone who approaches it without filing flight plan without following our regulations and that hasnt changed it hasnt changed for decades and thats what were going to continue to do
5863218 our presence here as far as the canadian military goes puts down an important footprint in the arctic
5863219 as the prime minister has said we use it or we lose it and we intend to use it
5863220 el estado toma la decisi n de alinear la industria del cemento con el gran objetivo de resolver progresivamente los problemas de vivienda entonces asume el control de las cementeras con una negociaci n muy transparente con las distintas empresas en el caso de holcim se negoci 85 de las acciones por 552 millones de d lares sin ning n tipo de problema fluy perfectamente la negociaci n igual que con lafarge donde se pagaron 267 millones de d lares por 89 de las acciones toda vez que ambas empresas quisieron quedarse con un porcentaje de las acciones
5863221 pues ped an una cifra que llegaba a los 1200 millones de d lares y por las estimaciones de acuerdo con las cotizaciones en la bolsa de valores no llega a 400 millones de d lares adem s no esta modernizada ni actualizada y requiere inversiones adicionales para colocarla en el nivel de excelencia de las otras dos que fueron nacionalizadas entonces se decreta la expropiaci n y se abre un proceso de acuerdo con el marco legal del pa s
5863222 hes so young and he was going to be a daddy
5863223 so many have been to afghanistan and died almost makes you think theyre trying to kill all the canadians
5863224 im not really canadian born but i appreciate what he did
5863225 josh was a great young man i am so proud of my son he could make anyone laugh he had a great sense of humour
5863226 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside senator barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5863227 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5863228 tell mom and dad its the safe way to break and pop not the things you shouldnt try
5863229 hoy 19 de agosto se grad an 398 alumnos de aproximadamente 9 estados obtuvieron el t tulo de licenciados en educaci n menci n desarrollo cultural la columna vertebral de la carrera la reconoce la universidad sim n rodr guez

5863232 este conjunto de donaciones entregadas forman parte de la responsabilidad social que lleva adelante este servicio y que d a a d a trabajan arduamente para seguir facilitando este tipo de ayudas econ micas
5863233 es indispensable para mejorar la calidad de vida de pedro nieves pues se le dificultaba mucho poder movilizarse dentro de su vivienda y el alto costo de la silla de rueda no le hab a permitido adquirirla
5863234 now is the right time for something like this to come with all the issues new york city has been having with construction accidents happening
5863235 employers are regressing and the building owners arent taking their duties as seriously as they should be
5863236 his bosses didnt give him anywhere to tie a safety line into
5863237 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5863238 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5863239 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5863240 well just have to pretend the crowd is cheering for us
5863241 we dont really care about the streak said walsh the saratoga native who played volleyball at archbishop mitty high and stanford
5863242 were just focusing on that medal we have so much respect for the chinese team but weve got to work on our own game
5863243 if we were to win we would have to be perfect
5863244 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5863245 un alcalde no es m s que un conserje que est para garantizarle a la gente su confort buscando las soluciones estructurales donde el presupuesto del municipio no alcance
5863246 la nica forma de traer soluciones estructurales en el municipio sucre pasa por un elemento de coordinaci n que incluye consejos comunales alcald a gobernaci n gobierno nacional que s lo lo garantizan los candidatos del psuv
5863247 la delegaci n de venezuela est sumamente complacida por la ratificaci n de estos espacios y las lecciones que le hemos dado a este ciudadano
5863248 it is astonishing that in 2008 conducting an election of any sort on the jewish high holiday of rosh hashana would even be considered especially in a town with such a large jewish population
5863249 i am glad that the edison school board recognized the objection and reconsidered their decision
5863250 i didnt think it would hurt a long time but since the trials ive been having trouble on my long runs and ive cut down my speed work on the track ive never had a problem like this before i had to adjust to that i dont think it hampered my training that much but you cant tell
5863251 i was getting boxed in a lot and thats something im always trying to avoid
5863252 some people were pushing me in and out somebody ripped my spikes by stepping on them i tried to escape it
5863253 i was working so hard i felt a little flat coming into the last bend
5863254 i was not comfortable i always want to win my heat coming in fourth felt like i barely made it
5863255 i knew i was running tough and i knew it was slow i should have gone to the front i felt really tired and could not go down the home straight i was really disappointed and i could not believe i did not make it but i had to let it go the following day i was thinking positively about it i look back now and i can only learn from it
5863256 id be lying if i said no to get into the final i have to run like its a final i will run 100 percent tomorrow im going to see how it is and if its slow and im comfortable i will push it and rely on my kick i just want to go out and run
5863257 workgroup be set up as soon as possible to settle the issue of the unreturned jewish properties
5863258 les marocains du monde et lagence de loriental f tent 1200 ans dhistoire dun royaume
5863259 well i know bush lives there and hell only be there till january and if you hire me well both be looking for apartments together i dont wanna room with him though
5863260 that bitch imelda marcos she ransacked our central bank and bought 3 000 pairs of shoes then my turd world kawntri went bankcrupt so i paddled my boat to america
5863261 was to expose civic legislative and opinion leaders in west virginia to imagine west virginias coal
5863262 bond insurer ambac financial group inc paid 850 million to citigroup inc to terminate a guaranty contract tied to 1 4 billion in troubled mortgage related securities the move sent shares of ambac and other bond insurers higher as investors anticipated more cancellations of similar contracts which could help the insurers clear out some of their losing positions while the terminations of cdo guarantees appears to be positive for many bond insurers it could spark a rush by financial institutions to get as much capital as they can from the insurers if the insurers make significant payouts now there could be less protection left for the rest of their policyholders which include investors that hold municipal bond guarantees said rob haines an analyst at credit sights
5863263 i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers at and id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
5863264 to be honest with you i did not particularly see this coming but im not totally shot out of the water by it
5863265 i understand the background and how many innings hes pitched
5863266 this is a tremendous credit to chris ray and what hes done and how hard hes worked to get himself where hes at
5863267 walk around basically i dont have to wear the boot soon i dont know when ill be able to run around
5863268 as excited as we all are of the possibility of him coming back here hes not going to do one thing before dr john wilckens and the medical staff allow him to do it
5863269 the wave of foreclosures is unprecedented making it difficult to analyze difficult to gauge how large it will get or how bad it will make things
5863270 since foreclosed properties are reduced in price until they sell an increase in foreclosure transactions simply means there are more foreclosures rather than more buyers
5863271 congress and the white house have offered a lifeline to many homeowners facing foreclosure which could help keep more people in their homes and fewer distressed properties from coming to the market
5863272 18 is young but you have to think if you are old enough to fight for our country are you old enough to buy a drink
5863273 i think people do stuff because its against the law its a little challenge if it was allowed i dont think as many would do it
5863274 that would bar illegal immigrants currently in the country from claiming social security credits for work done in years before they are assigned a valid social security number
5863275 the senate voted yesterday to allow illegal aliens to collect social security benefits based on past illegal employment even if the job was obtained through forged or stolen documents
5863276 illegals granted social security senate refuses to strip out provision
5863277 it would have prohibited those who come here illegally and work with forged or phony papers from receiving social security benefits in effect the senates action makes illegal immigrants a privileged class under law and down the road that largesse will prove costly
5863278 what is incorrigible about this coverage from associated press is that it is totally absent of any critical coverage i mean serious coverage examining the effects of homosexual parenting bringing in public policy data even bringing in pro family critics
5863279 you have this ridiculous situation in which these professional adoption organizations are talking about crossing the ts and dotting the is meanwhile theyre intentionally placing children in homes that are motherless or fatherless by design
5863280 intentionally placing children in homes that motherless and fatherless by design
5863281 if don cazayoux is really interested in explaining his energy record he might start by explaining why he voted to send congress on a month long vacation despite the fact that he has only been in office for a short few months
5863282 if cazayoux wants to tell his constituents the truth he should spend more time talking about his allegiance to nancy pelosi and the democrat leadership at the expense of louisiana voters who are reminded of their congressmans deplorable energy record every time they fill up their gas tanks
5863283 he didnt even notice when i stopped coloring my hair
5863284 mr saakashvili fought back with soft power the polished international image the fluent english repeated eloquent appeals on cable news for western support and frequently near histrionic claims about russian intentions and actions in the conflict
5863285 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
5863286 because i keep track of my time and send them a bill
5863287 i think the fact that canadians pay so much attention to the u s election is a sign that they really care about the united states a sign that they want it to get back to where it was before
5863288 de russische federatie zal het resolutievoorstel dat frankrijk vandaag voorstelde niet steunen

5863294 until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours working on things he was tireless
5863295 media reports have suggested mr green could step aside as early as this week b amp b told the exchange in a statement last night
5863296 the company is aware of ongoing media speculation relating to management and board changes
5863297 while no decision has been made a subcommittee of the companys board is meeting on the morning of thursday 21 august 2008 when necessary information is available to them to consider and make a decision on board changes as part of our response to corporate governance issues that have previously been raised and management changes in the context of our announced strategic review
5863298 the company is not in a position to release any announcement pending the result of that board subcommittee meeting
5863299 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
5863300 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
5863301 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did

5863313 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5863314 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5863315 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5863316 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5863317 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5863318 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back
5863319 in the last two weeks much has been made of the drop in gold prices to around us800 an ounce but this compares with a gold price of around us650 an ounce at the same time last year

5863344 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance she said
5863345 feedback from our active program of engagement with investors has highlighted a changed attitude towards acceptable levels of leverage
5863346 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline
5863347 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the current external environment represents an excellent achievement and demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
5863348 we recognise that our airline customers face challenging conditions but the first half result is evidence of the importance of investing in airports with attractive characteristics and opportunities across the aviation and commercial businesses
5863349 whilst our financial position is very sound we recognise that attitudes towards leverage have changed if not permanently then for the foreseeable future
5863350 consequently we are applying our surplus cash to the repayment of our hybrid capital instrument tickets which will simplify maps capital structure
5863351 whilst there is no provision for early redemption we are offering tickets holders a withdrawal option with any remaining balance to be defeased and repaid on 1 january 2010
5863352 the discount to valuation which the current security price represents remains near record levels
5863353 a buyback of this scale also aids the quality and sustainability of our distributions and our commitment to achieve broad convergence between our regular distribution and proportionate earnings by 2010
5863354 conducted at prices that reflect our full directors valuations generating substantial premia to the prices for maps original investment of 49 per cent for copenhagen and 47 per cent for brussels
5863355 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
5863356 asur meets maps key investment criteria and we expect the returns from this investment to be well above that offered by current and proposed major airport privatisations
5863357 we believe this investment demonstrates maps continued ability to source attractive growth opportunities

5863373 i think part of the reason we are saddened by the end of the physical newspaper has to do with the senses theres the sound of pages turning the feel of the paper the smell of the ink

5863383 never surrender is a phenomenal book by a man of great courage and an inspiring faith boykin takes us with him inside some of the most intriguing special operations in modern american history he explains the magnitude of the threat posed by rogue states and radical leaders who dont simply want to frighten us but to annihilate us i loved every page you will too
5863384 with all your years experience in the pentagon commanding delta force hunting jihadists around the globe
5863385 in your judgment how serious to us national security is the threat of radical islam in the 21stcentury
5863386 when i came into the army in 1971 we were focused on the soviet union
5863387 even though we were fighting in vietnam our real threat was the soviet union but i would say to you joel that the threat that radical islam presents to not only america but to the world today is an even more serious threat than when we were in a nuclear standoff during the cold war and its more concerning to me because this is an enemy that is hard to understand it is an enemy that is easy to ignore and it is an enemy that is absolutely relentless
5863388 well first of all i think that it is very clearly based on their own manifesto that they are adhering to a very radical an extreme interpretation of the quran they clearly believe that infidels infidels defined as those that do not serve allah must either be converted or killed
5863389 i think the worst case scenario is that they continue in their pursuit of weapons of m ass destruction
5863390 weapons of mass destruction are available to them now particularly chemical and biological and those are not hard to make but the worst case scenario is i think that they have nuclear capabilities that within these terrorist organizations within the jihadist movement that they intimidate europe to the point that europe is no longer capable of standing against them as they have done historically and that they take their extremism to the entire world and people start to buckle under the intimidation and pressure of really what i would see as a huge islamic movement
5863391 we know that he ahmadinejad has centrifuges sp inning we know that he has the technology he has the scientists and he certainly has the determination ahmadinejad is a very very dangerous man in my view i believe that the world should pay close attention to what he has said some would say well thats just rhetoric but lets go back and look at hitlers rhetoric in 1933 and what ultimately occurred
5863392 i think ahmadinejad is far more dangerous than the ayatollah khomeini because given that he now has more resources
5863393 certainly has more money as a result of the oil in iran he has greater weapons capabilities he has a more sophisticated army and military in general and regardless of what the 2007 national intelligence estimate says he is developing nuclear capabilities
5863394 my view is that negotiating with ahmadinejad is a waste of time
5863395 i dont think theres anything that you can appeal to in ahmadinejads view of geopolitics of life in general that would result in any kind of meaningful agreement with the west i think ahmadinejad sees himself as a man who is supposed to hasten the arrival of the mahdi he has even indicated that in his speeches ahmadinejad believes that the madhi will come as a result of his efforts part of which includes destroying or at least subjugating israel and so i think that the threat goes beyond just nuclear weapons i think the threat really is a threat of growing radicalism within iran which is influencing much of the thinking in the rest of the islamic world and ultimately when a man is that driven when a man is that convinced that allah is holding him accounta ble to do that destroy judeo christian civilization i think to believe that we could negotiate with him in any meaningful way is just inane

5863426 and jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven
5863427 why does this man speak that way he is blaspheming who can forgive sins but god alone
5863428 he has authority to forgive sins vs 10 to command disease vs 11 to call disciples vs 14
5863429 by what authority are you doing these things or who gave you this authority to do these things
5863430 he essentially came from a blues funk and rock corner and it was his ability to bring this attack to a jazz context that always seemed to be the defining factor

5863510 i started off a little sluggish and it took me awhile to get in the rhythm but once i did i was able to come through but at the end i was starting to lose my legs a little bit
5863511 to go to your first olympics and get a medal a silver medal nonetheless was great i couldnt ask for any more
5863512 in 04 i was a 12 foot pole vaulter not even so for me to come four years later and compete its just experience isinbayeva has been in the olympics before shes been in world championships shes jumped a decade longer than me
5863513 so its just a matter of time im going to keep working at it and see where it gets me
5863514 because in that moment i feel myself like an actress im there on the track and everyone is for me that is my crowd they cheer for me i felt that they wanted to see something great
5863515 it makes me really angry how is she supposed to talk that way about me she didnt beat my any times she is talking too much i prefer doing it and then talking i just wanted to prove who is the best in the olympic games
5863516 were very proud of our hometown girl and her family
5863517 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5863518 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that
5863519 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5863520 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5863521 he didnt have just one chinese to beat tonight he had 10 000
5863522 zou has a lot of pressure because all the boxers know that he is the world champion
5863523 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
5863524 if he can get another one at this olympics it would mean a lot to the whole of
5863525 hopefully i can keep the fun rolling to the 2012 olympics in london
5863526 a lot of boxers want to go pro and win titles but for me the last three years have been all about winning a medal

5863543 were hiring rachel because shes a smart person rachel goes far beyond politics shes an expert on military affairs she was a rhodes scholar
5863544 no obama has proposed a capital gains tax rate of 20 which is lower than the rate in the 1990s therefore its actually an overall economic tax cut
5863545 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5863546 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5863547 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5863548 if food and energy prices are going to come down some that opens the door for companies to make up some ground on other costs
5863549 its a small positive but you still have all the other negatives
5863550 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5863551 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5863552 as we look forward into the second half of the year we see continued pressure on our markets
5863553 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump
5863554 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5863555 reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue

5863558 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5863559 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5863560 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5863561 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5863562 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5863563 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5863564 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5863565 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5863566 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5863567 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5863568 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5863569 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5863570 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5863571 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5863591 ive long commented that while i dont think theres any directive in the newsroom to go easy on forest city ratner or its parent company forest city enterprises the business relationship means that the newspaper has an obligation to be exacting in its coverage and in the case of atlantic yards it has too often failed to do so
5863592 the omission of eminent domain in this article about east baltimore strikes me as another example of that failure
5863593 would have shown the dark side of development this article didnt want to do that it only wanted to show the shiny new penny on the east side

5863662 basically my own thoughts and my own reckoning with what has happened and my own studying and reading and meditating on those types of things
5863663 i thought we played real well after we started hitting at the end last night a 6 5 loss against hamilton
5863664 we really did we hadnt hit it that hard all year even in practice they stepped up to the plate especially against hamilton i was well pleased with them
5863665 i just went up there thinking i needed to get a hit
5863666 we needed to win the game it was a good game
5863667 i know scott wanted to sign and im disappointed it didnt work out for him in the same regard we are all excited he is returning for his senior year in my opinion we have the best pitcher in the southeastern conference returning for his senior year
5863668 im excited about the opportunity to return to ole miss and play baseball
5863669 there is nothing like pitching in front of rebel fans and i am ready to get back out there and do that for another season
5863670 if you are super super good i will buy you legos
5863671 whats your background tell me about yourself do you love your job
5863672 well i love my job too so thats something we have in common
5863673 weird old man routine its fake and vain a shameless play for an oscar nod
5863674 my secret my shared secret with the director jonathan levine and sometimes you have to have them was exactly that im playing the child
5863675 and that was my message to myself throughout the shoot
5863676 youre absolutely right it must happen that ah moment youve got to have it im sure painters have it theyre working away on a canvas and suddenly they go ah there it is certainly i knew i wanted squires to have his brain coming out through his scalp so i knew hed need to have hair because this
5863677 at that point i thought well i cant quite see the portrait yet but theres something there yes
5863678 but it really happened when we shot the first scene josh is in my office he says do you want me to lie on the couch or anything and the way he said it left me no choice but to reply do do you want to lie on the couch i realised that everything this man does is for the first time that was the first little breath of ah that i found
5863679 yes its a love story i think iago is in love with othello and i think don loves gal loves him like a soldier loves a general these dynamics to me are everything theres no film without them
5863680 three or four years ago i realized there was a demon i needed to be face to face with so that i could say you can go now thank you you can go i felt this shift something had been clinging on some demon was sitting over me with a knife and fork ready to eat me every day
5863681 the other way around the demons left then the happiness came
5863682 im surprised i cant because i know im warmer more embracing i find my emotional triggers are closer to the surface easier to reach i dont have to dig too deep between action and cut its right there
5863683 the first jewish comedy feature film to come out of britain
5863684 today i went on a fast train through the tunnel under the sea
5863685 it only takes a couple of hours either way not bad eh
5863686 i know there are people out there going oh its all a big con
5863687 thats insulting to me because im proud to have somers town in my family of work if no one knew eurostar had funded it they wouldnt give it a second thought
5863688 basically we said to shane whatever you think it is it is
5863689 this was shanes project we had no idea what was coming out so there was a real danger of us ending up with something we couldnt use that was a massive risk for us
5863690 i do understand the suspicions but i wish people would not prejudge
5863691 its so difficult to get british films made that any form of new finance deserves to be explored the fact is that shane made this under the exact same auspices as hed make any film
5863692 if people are seeing the benefits to st pancras and the regeneration weve been involved in then that obviously helps our reputation if that makes them more likely to go on a eurostar train then thats good as well
5863693 those traditional coca cola ads id like to teach the world to sing they gave you a nice feeling inside but it was pretty intangible stuff this film has the same effect you come away thinking nice old eurostar and maybe that steers you towards buying a 150 train ticket
5863694 the moment its done badly it will be a disaster if people sit down to watch a damn good film then fair enough but if they pay to watch some grossly overt propaganda then theyll feel cheated and will end up resenting the brand and it will probably never happen again
5863695 well if you want to define it that way ive not got a clever argument to oppose it
5863696 but i never once thought about eurostar when i was making this film im not selling my soul to the devil here
5863697 tinkers with the holy bible of how films are made in this country
5863698 the first that proves i can move away from my community its also the first film where ive worked with actors in a foreign language its a film thats made me want to go to eastern europe its a film thats started me on a whole new path
5863699 lives two very different almost opposing lives that naturally must be characterized among other things by very different hairstyles
5863700 pursued by fatality a fighter with no luck a fallen angel
5863701 they are what give me the greatest feeling of security when it comes to breathing life into this story
5863702 something very pirandello like the actors get inside their characters and talk among themselves with the only information to which they have access that is what i give them in the script as well as being fun its a very good exercise for feeling that you are the other
5863703 weve finished the ninth week of shooting these days we are tackling the darkest part of the film the film touches on many genres this week its the thriller i admit that in recent years ive had a weakness for this genre and for the western but i wouldnt know how to come to grips with a western
5863704 at the end when the characters of jeanne moreau and her unfortunate lover maurice ronet are cornered condemned to live in different prisons some photos appear of the couple in their good moments embracing
5863705 jeanne moreaus voiceover talks of those photographed embraces as something eternal something that no one will be able to break and that will remain forever while she will waste away in prison my next film broken embraces talks about that kind of embrace

5863710 i know federal agents have been certainly aware of what happened subsequent to our meeting which is that the city attorney filed a lawsuit that fully and completely blocked my audit
5863711 the fact that the city attorney has blocked my attempt to do performance audits twice now makes me step back and ask whats he trying to hide
5863712 any allegation of wrongdoing is nothing more than garbage being shoveled by the citys attorneys political opponents hiding behind the cloak of anonymity

5863732 this is disappointing because we have made efforts to manage the amount of cricket he has played this season with the plan to have him still playing in september and we nearly got there
5863733 im still delighted with his season we would have settled for 42 wickets at a strike rate of a wicket every 30 deliveries now we want to get him back fitter and stronger for the cricket that lies ahead of him there is cartilage damage and we need to clean it out and tidy it up but that is pretty routine there is no pain and the swelling has gone down
5863734 people ask me if british indians buy my book and of course they do we were out there like everyone else at university and didnt really spend time in the kitchen with our mums
5863735 we go to the gym to be healthy we take vitamins to be healthy but eating healthy food does most of the work for you
5863736 i dont want to be in the kitchen for two hours making a vegetable stew which is what my mother would do i cook like someone of our generation i lighten everything i freshen everything
5863737 i heard that stereotype of having a curry on a friday night and i didnt know what the hell it meant because for me indian food is home food
5863738 i thought im going to do something with my life im not going to be a housewife like my mother and her mother
5863739 i saw myself living the rest of my life in this office it was soul destroying
5863740 every time in my food career when i think its not working or its too slow something keeps me at it
5863741 i love pottering about looking at fresh ingredients when im cooking i feel at peace i feel contentment its calming methodical youre not trying to solve global poverty youre just chopping coriander
5863742 today i went on a fast train through the tunnel under the sea
5863743 it only takes a couple of hours either way not bad eh
5863744 i know there are people out there going oh its all a big con
5863745 thats insulting to me because im proud to have somers town in my family of work if no one knew eurostar had funded it they wouldnt give it a second thought
5863746 basically we said to shane whatever you think it is it is
5863747 this was shanes project we had no idea what was coming out so there was a real danger of us ending up with something we couldnt use that was a massive risk for us
5863748 i do understand the suspicions but i wish people would not prejudge
5863749 its so difficult to get british films made that any form of new finance deserves to be explored the fact is that shane made this under the exact same auspices as hed make any film
5863750 if people are seeing the benefits to st pancras and the regeneration weve been involved in then that obviously helps our reputation if that makes them more likely to go on a eurostar train then thats good as well
5863751 those traditional coca cola ads id like to teach the world to sing they gave you a nice feeling inside but it was pretty intangible stuff this film has the same effect you come away thinking nice old eurostar and maybe that steers you towards buying a 150 train ticket
5863752 the moment its done badly it will be a disaster if people sit down to watch a damn good film then fair enough but if they pay to watch some grossly overt propaganda then theyll feel cheated and will end up resenting the brand and it will probably never happen again
5863753 well if you want to define it that way ive not got a clever argument to oppose it
5863754 but i never once thought about eurostar when i was making this film im not selling my soul to the devil here
5863755 tinkers with the holy bible of how films are made in this country
5863756 the first that proves i can move away from my community its also the first film where ive worked with actors in a foreign language its a film thats made me want to go to eastern europe its a film thats started me on a whole new path

5863766 turns out barack obama has received more money from exxonmobil and from oil than john mccain has
5863767 in texas alone june oil and gas connected donations to mccains victory 08 fund his hybrid fundraising venture with the rnc and state committees reached 1 214 100 of that total 881 450 or 73 percent came after june 15 mccain announced his position in favor of offshore drilling on june 16
5863768 the administration absolutely was telling him not to provoke the russians and to resolve the dispute peacefully
5863769 and then just a month ago you had secretary rice in tbilisi standing next to saakashvili saying in response to a question from him
5863770 and its clear that she had something else in mind she was talking about the dispute with our allies over joining nato but this very open ended statement on her part i think cannot but have created some opportunities for misunderstanding let me put it that way
5863771 well i want to go back to the question about american the american voice here i think hes absolutely right america wasnt speaking with a single clear voice
5863772 we had lower level state department officials giving a correct message but it was confused and it was overridden by a louder voice from washington that came particularly from the neocon community i think we see tragic consequences from that
5863773 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used

5863796 you have an obligation to believe in g d now let me tell you what it is youre believing in
5863797 you should believe and know that there is a first infinite cause to creation because its logical we call that infinite cause g d
5863798 the foundation of all foundations and the pillar of all wisdom is to know that there is a first cause

5863818 i know what youre thinking why cant we start with step three
5863819 peoples emotional states are tied to their job competencies you cant make changes without addressing this
5863820 every service call is a sales call and every sales call is a service call
5863821 if you cant get to this dont bother trying to do sales and service transformation

5863828 its not like currency has helped it take market share or expand margins
5863829 the latest round of results means big cap information technology companies are going to make it through the rest of the year
5863830 theyre going to obviously see some impact from the rising dollar this is going to influence their overseas revenue and will have some impact on their bottom line
5863831 this pushes out the wall of worry for tech investors until another 90 days
5863832 it looks like results are going to be close to normal for these two groups
5863833 it is not to say nobody is concerned about these things there is tremendous concern

5863839 oh no no thats too kind were just ok good enough
5863840 you are the youngest in the department and therefore keep quiet listen to us and do things our way
5863841 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5863842 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
5863843 the way i guess what frontrunner means and the way i think about it is completely different from what theyre using it
5863844 like i said theyre on your side theyre demanding fans everybody knows that when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre not doing good theyre going to let you know we expect better we want better and we want it now and i think they feel that by doing that they can influence the way you play but when youre giving off that negative energy it really doesnt
5863845 people can take it how they want it wasnt a false statement but it wasnt trying to take a cheap shot at anyone either

5863854 dont bite your tongue how to foster rewarding relationships with your adult children
5863855 one of the most important factors in maintaining a healthy relationship with adult children is forgiving both yourself and your child for not being perfect
5863856 one day it could mean being compassionate and another day it could mean being high achieving with conflicting desires so there is no perfection
5863857 tell them what you expect and invite your returning child to do the same agreeing together about the rules of the house before your adult child returns may be key to preventing every out of place coffee cup shoe or t shirt from becoming a cue to reenact past dramas

5863863 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5863864 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
5863865 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
5863866 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that

5863871 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
5863872 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5863873 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population
5863874 i believe that this novel signaling behavior could indicate the owls current reproductive status to potential intruders such as other territorial owls or non breeding floaters
5863875 such marking behavior may have been overlooked in birds and i hope that our story will represent the beginning of new and stimulating explorations on other questions and mechanisms in territoriality and social communication
5863876 faeces may represent an ideal substance for marking because it has a minimal energetic cost to the signaler and can continue to indicate possession of a territory when the owner is occupied in activities other than territorial defense
5863877 to obtain stronger evidence on the intriguing idea that eagle owls use faeces and prey feathers to signal current reproduction
5863878 we will need to perform further experimental studies and behavioral observations that examine whether faeces and feathers provoke specific behavioral reactions and what functional significance these behavioral reactions have
5863879 owls responded so rapidly to the removal of their faecal marks that during the night after the spraying that they came back to defecate not only on the same posts but precisely on the painted stretches
5863880 the development of animal free coating methods for hescs still remains a major challenge due to the complexity of ecms and insufficient knowledge about how hescs control cell cell and cell ecm interactions
5863881 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
5863882 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
5863883 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
5863884 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
5863885 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
5863886 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines

5863899 we have already seen these adverse effects on publicly traded las vegas gaming stocks when questions about adverse market conditions affecting future revenues arise these las vegas casinos are in better financial position than those in laughlin to be sure but they also face revenue and job losses as a result of demand destruction through cannibalization

5863904 what then shall we say in response to this if god is for us who can be against us he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
5863905 no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us
5863906 no temptation has seized you except what is common to man and god is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it
5863907 god will not put onto your shoulders more than what you can bear
5863908 god will not put unto you more than you can bear
5863909 we were under great pressure far beyond our ability to endure so that we despaired even of life
5863910 he has delivered us from such a deadly peril and he will deliver us
5863911 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that christs power may rest on me

5863915 weve got to hope for the best i dont know what were going to do without her
5863916 weve got the best doctors and physios in the world so im sure theyll get it right but were going to go out there and give it our best shot regardless
5863917 we hadnt seen them play beforehand so we just watched a bit of tape on them but we hadnt seen them play live
5863918 we didnt really know what to expect but i think they were still pretty tough with us and pretty physical
5863919 its the olympics so weve got to expect that but it was a good hit out for us
5863920 our bigs did a good job of getting out and running kristi harrower did a great job of getting them the ball on the run
5863921 so some of our players lost confidence at the beginning of the game
5863922 ive been speaking to usa head coach anne donovan and she and i agree that russia are one of the form teams
5863923 people can perceive this is a two horse race between the opals and the us but i certainly dont see it that way
5863924 theyve got a great player in jekabsone zogota playing them leading up to playing russia is going to be a really big test for us
5863925 what you should prepare for is mess lifes a mess
5863926 in order to be wary of the truth you must first know it that requires great frankness to yourself
5863927 global it world you can simply take you time and visit web sites to find that
5863928 many of the people there had extensive service time with us and we wanted to make sure they were treated with dignity and respect
5863929 theyre ensuring that employees go out and say yes i lost my job but they gave me this also its proven that if a person goes through an outplacement firm the risk of a lawsuit is reduced dramatically
5863930 im not a young person and my main concern because im in my late 50s was how id be received in the job market
5863931 to hear that we were going to close was heartbreaking
5863932 after speaking with them i realized my leadership skills are transferable
5863933 companies tell us that even though theyre paying people to go to these workshops their productivity doesnt go down even though theyre eventually being laid off

5863949 as a member of the sierra club board mark gordon helped them just what kind of republican is he
5863950 when you find yourself in a hole you stop digging
5863951 career politicians like cynthia lummis just dont get it she voted to increase taxes on gasoline supported raising taxes to balance the state budget and opposed tax relief for veterans
5863952 cynthia lummis will dig a deeper hole not get us out of the one were already in
5863953 we have orders of magnitude more wyoming contributors than the entire other side combined so clearly people believe in what we are trying to do
5863954 only democrat taking on tom feeney that has consistently opposed the war in iraq
5863955 icanns fellowship program helps make sure we have the widest possible representation from the developing and least developed world
5863956 as a global entity with a global mandate we need to hear from every corner of the globe but some countries and internet users just didnt have the resources to attend the fellowship program helps bridge that gap
5863957 the cairo meeting is an historic one for icann and marks our 10th anniversary as an organization
5863958 our entire community will welcome the fellows participation and their input on key discussions we will be having around internationalized domain names and new generic top level domains

5863962 if everyone acted more like me everything would be perfect
5863963 those are the years where kids still are kids you want to say theyre adults but they dont behave as adults when it comes to drinking
5863964 theres a lot of things that i think make the debate timely
5863965 whether its our kids giving their lives at 18 to save this country i think the issues about voting and responsibility to vote
5863966 im trying to understand if it should be reduced at all should it be reduced in certain circumstances at certain locations
5863967 colleges already have kids drinking that are 18 19 20 so why not make it legal
5863968 i think there are certain circumstances where people are responsible at 18 to drink
5863969 i dont think 18 year olds of today are responsible
5863970 i dont think it will make any difference because if the kids want to drink at age of 18 theyll drink anyway
5863971 i think people should consider lowering the drinking age and increase the driving age
5863972 blood started coming because i think she had something in her hand and hit him in his head
5863973 another lady pulled out a gun put the clip in
5863974 she put the clip in but when she did it seemed like she didnt do it right so it came right back out and fell on the ground

5863980 ian g paisleys psychopathic outburst amounted to incitement to murder republicans of course the british crown forces already have a long history of murdering republicans on sight but there was always continuity in resistance to british rule the british forces of occupation have no right to be in ireland let alone to employ the use of lethal force on irish soil or against irish citizens resisting their presence
5863981 whether mr paisley likes it or not the republican movement is growing and will continue to grow attacks such as the one in lisnaskea can be ended through a complete british withdrawal from ireland
5863982 the man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer
5863983 the fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool
5863984 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
5863985 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
5863986 of course the british crown forces already have a long history of murdering republicans on sight
5863987 achieving a united ireland should be the first priority of the government

5863996 i have deep religious beliefs and values i had experiences in my life where i had to rely on god not to get me through another day or another hour but another minute
5863997 i also believe that talking too much about ones faith and religion in my view is something between me and god
5863998 i have attended north phoenix baptist church for many years and the most important thing is that im a christian
5863999 i dont have anything else to say about the issue

5864004 they said he was lying down and didnt feel like talking

5864006 you got better things to do guys im not the guy
5864007 you like him and respect him for his knowledge on these issues and we need somebody helping running the country who knows the world and knows the worlds problems
5864008 that is why i am proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional 1 billion in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5864009 weve had a lot of needs that have gone unmet
5864010 we dont have a capital bill we dont have our bills paid off yet we have a problem with our pension system theres been personality conflicts down here which i think i can overcome
5864011 ive worked very hard with the house speaker ive worked very hard with the governor
5864012 and i would go in with an open mind hoping that wed come together on that issue and compromise to address the infrastructure needs for the state of illinois

5864021 the fact is the republicans will lie cheat and steal in order to remain in power so that their big business network can lie cheat and steal
5864022 hold barack obamas rhetoric to account and expose his record of political expedience
5864023 theres no doubt we cannot compete with the sheer weight of the democratic convention but what we can do is offer some loyal opposition

5864026 our polling today shows mccain well outside the margin of error in both of those counties
5864027 but they will be battlegrounds i give senator obama credit for coming in trying to fight it out there for every vote
5864028 i think this is not the forum to really get into that
5864029 john mccain is a republican i can not predict exactly how he will work with the other office seekers of our side but i think he will be a working partner
5864030 at this time the polling is clearly for mark warner but i have seen a lot of strange things in politics in my 48 years in politics we are not conceding anything
5864031 well mark warner qualifies mark has a very centrist image up here in northern virginia mark has some unique attributes living up here that make him particularly more formidable than the average democrat in northern virginia
5864032 these middle aged republican white men are in for a surprise when the votes are counted on election day their private polls grossly undercount newly registered black and young voters and are based on voter registration lists that are outdated and inaccurate

5864050 the average purchaser of video games is 39 years old proving that video gaming is attracting a much broader audience
5864051 when video game consoles began to appear in the 1980s they were dismissed as a short lived craze or at the very least the domain for awkward adolescents
5864052 how astonishingly wrong we were our research has revealed that the teenage boys that played atari back then are still playing video games now largely being drawn in to new advanced electronic gaming that simulates real life interaction that their kids love as well
5864053 and while were not suggesting the market for teen and young adult men is not a strong market men between 18 and 45 still represent 37 percent of the game playing market its the other demographics which are posting significant growth
5864054 the average american gamer has been playing for 12 years and is now on average 35 years of age
5864055 when comparing todays industry climate with that of 20 years ago there is a marked shift in the sectors target client base it is apparent that women and many adults are no longer shunning the fun
5864056 companies are frantically at work developing games for what they hope will be expand into fresh new markets
5864057 until those original gamers cease playing either due to death or physical incapacity losing interest appears unlikely meaning new gamers entering the market will not be replacing those leaving theyll just be adding to the swelling numbers worldwide
5864058 wii fit is the perfect example of how recent developments in game design and marketing are opening up female gamers as the potential growth market in the industry and the fact women comprise 38 percent of game players indicates the level of growth available to the industry as there are still very few titles designed specifically to target that demographic wii fit shows the attention women can expect to receive as manufacturers and developers actively chase the female dollar
5864059 parents also fall into the older gamer category and the sheer number of them playing games with their children is another factor driving industry growth
5864060 some surveys npd suggest that 93 percent of parents playing video games have children who are playing too in fact nearly half the games sold in 2006 held an e rating and with 39 the average age of a game buyer that would suggest the mom and dad market is a major one
5864061 the result is a healthy balance sheet for the video games industry
5864062 this is an industry in an enviable position with a loyal client base regularly topped up by a fresh generation of users with older players failing to desert the sector at the age originally expected around a third of american households have a gaming console which means the industry can still achieve considerable growth spurred on by constantly evolving technology
5864063 the more elaborate our means of communication the less we communicate
5864064 we dont index every one of those trillion pages many of them are similar to each other or represent auto generated content that isnt very useful to searchers but were proud to have the most comprehensive index of any search engine and our goal always has been to index all the worlds data

5864067 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5864068 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5864069 the audience embraces it because they relate to the people involved who they care about
5864070 theyre great at drama but there are many nuances that can be left out without getting the reality from the troops themselves

5864078 moreover strange and allarming rumours began to circulate concenrning initiates or adepts they were surrounded everywhere with an omious influence and they destroyed or distracted those who allowed themselves to be beguiled by their honeyed eloquence or by the sourcery of their learning
5864079 thirdly the evil might come so suddenly upon a man that it can only be ascribed to witchcraft an example as to how this happened to one man has been made known to us a certain well born citizen of spires had a wife who was of such an obstinate disposition that though he tried to please her in every way yet she refused in nearly every way to comply with his wishes and was always plaguing him with abusive taunts it happened that on going into his house one day and his wife railing against hm as usual with opprobious words he wised to go out of the house to escape rom the quarreling but she quickly ran before him and locked the door by which he was to go out and loudly swore that unless he beat her there was no honesty or faithfulness in him at these heavy words he strethch out his hand not intending to hurt her and struck her ligtly with his open palm on the buttock whereupon he suddenly fell to the ground and lost all his senses and lay in bed for many weeks afflicted with a most grevious illness now it is obvious that this was not a natural illness but was caused by sme witchcraft of the woman and very many similar caseshave happened and been made known to many
5864080 liberals are two times more likely to say it is okay to cheat the government out of welfare money you dont deserve
5864081 i throw my ego to the ground when it comes to trading
5864082 we have to have some humility on the issue on the of confronting
5864083 we have recently instituted a unique online version of these systems to provide our clients with cost effective portability any company with multiple depots can use these systems with only one server and can access information about their operations from anywhere at any time
5864084 the overall conclusion then is that almost all of the decline in religious attendence in the u s over the past 30 years has taken place among those younger adults who have not married
5864085 many are just trying to survive some experience issue fatigue where there are so many issues to address the pastor doesnt know which one to do next so he just doesnt talk about any of them
5864086 sometimes a pastor may want to talk about an issue but he knows there will be consequences
5864087 the moment you speak about public policy from the pulpit you divide the house if you speak out on homosexuality you may offend someone who has a gay relative if you speak out on abortion you offend the women in the congregation who have had abortions and there are many men who have been responsible for impregnating women who have had abortions
5864088 pastors who speak as individuals and not on behalf of their congregations can legally and fearlessly engage in a wide range of political activity whereas churches risk their tax exempt status by intervening in political campaigns pastors have the same rights as any other american
5864089 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 23 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 24 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 25 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen
5864090 know ye not that ye are the temple of the holy ghost
5864091 we have sort of become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining
5864092 a defining moment for our country we want to encourage people to get up get out and go vote
5864093 barack is the first candidate in my lifetime to strip some of this bullshit away and i just hope we dont blow this chance if we miss this opportunity we dont deserve it how bad does it have to get
5864094 i am watching hillary clinton in her victory speech in new hampshire they just threw a bunch of college kids behind her and had her talk about student loans and had her daughter come out for a long awkward hug does anyone actually buy it surely young people are too media savvy to be fooled by this kind of shit do we live in a democracy just so we can keep electing the same families

5864187 sabbath requires surrender if we only stop when we are finished with all our work we will never stop because our work is never completely done with every accomplishment there arises a new responsibility every swept floor invites another sweeping every child bathed invites another bathing when all life moves in such cycles what is ever finished the sun goes round the moon goes round the tides and seasons go round people are born and die and when are we finished if we refuse rest until we are finished we will never rest until we die sabbath dissolves the artificial urgency of our days because it liberates us from the need to be finished

5864199 the little bell that struck when you reached the end of a line the sssseeeeech of the carriage being rolled back after a line the kreek kreek kreek of the roller being rotated to adjust the alignment of paper the ink stains on the fingers while replacing the ribbons the clickety clack of typewriters is long gone from our newsrooms as indeed are the monsters who evoked awe with their sheer typing speed and the composers whose typewriters sounded as if they were composing songs on their machines not paragraphs of prose but to a generation brought up on the typewriter and its close cousin the teleprinter the sight noise and magic of striking type on paper furiously if the head was bobbing with ideas slowly if the boss was hovering around is a memory that no new technology can erase

5864259 the vast majority have no doubt mccain is qualified for the white house as don frederick notes at the
5864260 the findings indicate that the mccain camps controversial advertising thrust of late depicting obama as a mere
5864261 the findings also suggest that to stem the inroads mccain has made against him obama needs to change the conversation after all its not as if hes going to be able to substantially beef up his resume in the two and a half months until election day

5864271 while this will be a distraction and a diversion for us i believe we will prevail in court

5864287 i carry a bag of trash out with me every morning but i always end up picking up other peoples trash theres homeless people like me who dont believe in mess
5864288 most of this stuff was soaking wet and had been lying here for a long time
5864289 in this progressive liberal city ive come across numerous articles that put homeless people in a bad light
5864290 so when we saw this place we thought next time they say homeless people are doing this or that theyll be able to see were doing something positive
5864291 i think this is a real good idea so we can show people that not all homeless people are trash
5864292 in addition to areas under public storm signal 2 and 3 classes in the elementary and secondary levels are suspended tomorrow wednesday in la union pangasinan zambales tarlac bataan pampanga and bulacan

5864295 this is my first gold ever at nationals and it felt really good
5864296 i always set my goals really high and i had a goal of being in the top six and making the finals all that hard work pays off
5864297 roller skating is one of my favorite things to do
5864298 it has always been in the family i like the thrill of winning i like to get nervous and have that feeling you cant mess up you have to go out there and be the best you can be
5864299 i set a goal to win this specific event so i could move up to another level i didnt have huge expectations going in i just wanted to make it a vacation and not put much pressure on myself it worked out well
5864300 i wanted to get back in it for fun and exercise
5864301 but once you start something you want to do the best you can i enjoy skating with the kids down there in roseburg the most the best part is watching the youth grow
5864302 im quite confident in saying that none of the officers i know would dare do that
5864303 spaceship or whatever it was and i dont think even the nsa has a computer good enuff to run the game on all maximum settings having said all that i cant wait to give it a whirl either lol i liked that character from the first game so it will be fun playing
5864304 the great challenge was to edit those things as short as they could be and still have them make sense
5864305 sheepmeister one thing i know youre good at other than wooing beautiful young fillies is all things macery
5864306 to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy
5864307 to build excitement for a game that is about to begin
5864308 believe there is such a thing as a global war on terror
5864309 one of the things we found in the poll even under a large number of democratic voters is that theres a concern about obamas experience
5864310 hes this hip cool guy that may feed into this concern that voters have about him
5864311 translation pennsylvanians just plain ainta buyin the leftist obama agenda

5864314 this recasts our entire development assistance relationship with these countries on one core principle mutual responsibility
5864315 and if thats successful then the next step is the legislation provides for the ability to have stoppages and what were seeking is stoppages of either a four hour duration 12 hours or 24 hours duration
5864316 a train to be lost is most probably two million dollars in loss to rio tinto
5864317 its currently 105 million council had a consideration to go to 130 million but all of those things are in the melting pot in the business case
5864318 the department of community services is working with the police to try and find these children
5864319 until these children are found thats when the department of community services will come into action to work with the children and the family but most importantly we need to find who these children are
5864320 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to
5864321 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5864322 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5864323 for example just one per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5864324 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5864325 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5864326 the reason there are casualties in afghanistan is because afghanistan particularly the afghanistan pakistan border area is the current hotbed of international terrorism
5864327 it is in our national interest to be there it is in the international communitys interest for there to be a concerted nato and other international community support in that effort
5864328 any death is a tragic death but it cuts both ways
5864329 this is essentially a war it is a war against extremism and terrorism and unfortunately there are casualties
5864330 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5864331 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5864332 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the coast could be comparable to coal
5864333 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5864334 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5864335 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field
5864336 bryce i really doubt that a bus could jump a 50 foot gap this movie is shit i hate keanu reeves

5864344 forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
5864345 expect a new low below 8591 before a more significant low forms the psychological 85 level is potential support it is also possible that a triangle is forming as wave 4 if this is the case then the 4th wave price extreme is already in place at 8795 but the audusd range would tighten before a terminal thrust lower completes the decline
5864346 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5864347 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5864348 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5864349 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5864350 well just try to match up the best way we can
5864351 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5864352 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role

5864369 consumers are always being encouraged to make greener purchases but theres no real road map as to where to make these purchases and whether or not what they do buy is green
5864370 the green products our members can buy through directbuy have been rated by recognized green authorities like energy star leed or the sustainable furniture council so you know the green purchase youre making is part of the solution
5864371 we all know we should be making greener purchases particularly when it comes to products we use in our everyday lives like lighting and appliances unfortunately making those wiser choices can be quite costly by making all these green options available at directbuy we give our members the choice to save money and valuable natural resources

5864373 the u s mint buys direct from the refiners and this suspension of gold eagle sales may be an indication that the supply line is already backing up or that the mint expects that it will back up for the rest of the year i wonder who would give up physical metal at these prices and under these circumstances except distressed sellers the central banks are in a hunker down mode as far as i can determine and its the mines that supply the refiners so if the mint which buys from the refiners is having a difficult time locating metal what does that tell you i keep saying that we may get a surprising rubber band effect later in the year when the pre holiday festival season kicks off in september october it may happen sooner one of our indicators of approaching a bottom in gold is how many calls centennial precious metals gets from our u s based indian clientele heres a quote from my offices report to me at the end of the day today today was a good day there must have been an indian convention where someone was handing out usagold business cards that may give you a clue as to thinking in india proper and probably the rest of the asian rim
5864374 people are letting their own house and then renting something more suitable to their current needs
5864375 many households have sold their family homes and move into rental acommodation for six to twelve months in order to reassess the market before buying

5864381 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5864382 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5864383 the economies of germany france and italy all contracted in the first quarter and may now be in full recession shattering assumptions that europe would prove able to shrug off the effects of the credit crunch the picture is darkening so fast in spain that prime minister jose luis zapatero canceled holidays and called his cabinet back to madrid yesterday for the first emergency session of its kind since the franco dictatorship growth has turned negative in ireland denmark latvia and estonia while grinding to a halt in sweden and the netherlands iceland contracted by a staggering 3 7pc the grim data from eurostat follows a recession warning in britain and shock news that the japanese economy had shrunk 0 6pc in the second quarter almost the entire bloc of rich organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries still two thirds of the world economy are now in the grip of a major downturn
5864384 if you hate america so much why dont you move to cuba
5864385 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
5864386 maybe if pz also stopped being such a dick he wouldnt get pestered by others
5864387 turn the other cheek if you wanna get to heaven
5864388 one day a religious leader is going to show up claim to be god and say something to the effect of
5864389 and in case it isnt apparent to your little peabrain im referring to you chuck you dumbfuck
5864390 im being amused but really dont think its worth your effort or the cost to others of sending this stuff so please stop your plan has failed miserably
5864391 turn the other cheek if you wanna get to heaven
5864392 hmm that tom sure as hell was a gifted draughtsman
5864393 learn to read chuck the reason the plan fails is the false assumption that im being pestered which you share with whoever is sending me this stuff
5864394 you think like the people who send me these things in your assumption that im being
5864395 the point is if you werent such a fanatical dick they wouldnt pester you or attempt to pester you in the first place think
5864396 the next shock is going to be bigger and bigger still
5864397 the shocks keep getting bigger because we keep propping things up and bailing everyone out
5864398 guys were making too many mistakes here in the u k
5864399 oh my god were going to go down and if we go down the whole system goes down
5864400 okay got to print some more money got to save the day
5864401 you know others cant do this but its alright for us
5864402 i look at things differently now maybe from the outside im not sure but things seem different things i once thought i understood i read xxs blog i have since they started it when i used to read about their drowning in the deep waters of depression and mental illness i felt a kinship to them an understanding almost a camraderie as if we were both on this sinking ship together now i read it and they seem sad pathetic even they are very small trapped at the bottom of a hole only the hole is not very deep and they could clumb out of it if they would look around long enough to see where they are but they sit in that hole and lament laments and talks about how glamorous it is to be crazy when i look now i dont agree when i look now i am looking from a height as if i have climbed out of the hole and am now above it waiting for them to give climbing a go and its not about therapy john walker helped me of course but so much of it just happened as i grew up sitting in that hole is so boring proclaiming how glamorous it is to be unhappy is boring driving friends and family away is boring self obsession is boring its strange to see and think that now after so many years of believing the opposite its why i cant go back to jw things are differnt now that part of my life is over it would be pointless to go back especially when my view has so changed what really dug me out i think was having no other choice when i was in louisiana i couldnt lay around and mope i had classes to go to things to do through this i came to think realize that depression is selfishness i feel strange writing it having idolized it for so long but depression seems formed on the concept that the world revolves around you i still get depressed sometimes more often than not in these familliar places the ho hum stills my soul and i dont like it but even the depression now has changed it is not as deep when its happening i can recognize it and call it out sometimes i can even see it coming i dont know how i feel about it anymore i used to think the illness was the key that it made you interesting unique that it made you special enough to be allowed to create something maybe even to be taken seriously but its not is it its just another weakness isnt it i dont know i dont know but maybe id rather be weird unique and extraordinary than crazy if xx could see themselves the way we do us few along the rim of that hole i hope theyd try to pull themselves out because in the end their the only one who can do the saving at least thats the was it was for me
5864403 i enjoyed every year i was here but 98 was special
5864404 we had a lot of players that had big years
5864405 kerry wood broke out that year kevin tapani won 19 games rod beck saved 51 games mark grace hit his usual 310 with 40 doubles and jose hernandez came out of nowhere to hit 25 home runs for us
5864406 it was a great year but we ran into the braves in the playoffs and got swept in three games
5864407 we felt good going in because we had beaten the braves six out of nine that year and matched up well against them but john smoltz shut us down the first day and it was downhill from there
5864408 its a great sports city great city for restaurants and when the weather breaks everyone comes out
5864409 fans have really warmed up to the white sox you have two really dynamic guys here now in ozzie guillen and lou piniella and its starting to even out a little bit the white sox are catching up
5864410 i think the manager would get tremendous credit and would be remembered forever
5864411 but the whole team would be remembered it has been so long and its going to take a special group to do that they would have reunions every 10 years forever
5864412 i think time wise were going to be ok with that
5864413 im not sure how im going to make all that work once we get those guys back come september its a challenge to get everyone work but well do the best we can
5864414 its more than likely barfield is going to be here
5864415 hes making some progress and hes been through a lot this year too
5864416 well try to work it out the best we can
5864417 hes a guy that has everyday ability if he can put it all together
5864418 i am ok i feel ok and im ready to go
5864419 ryan howard has had his share of boos ive had my share pat burrell has had his share i dont think theyve touched chase utley yet and i hope it remains that way theres definitely times when you see guys going to the plate and see the expression on their face its like man i got to start doing something ive got to figure something out theyre halfway defeated before they get up there
5864420 when were winning 5 3 and a guy makes an out thats not the time to boo
5864421 when you look at the amount of saves weve had and the amount of games weve won i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what a central figure hes been on our ballclub
5864422 but thats looking at the glass half full and im still looking at the glass up there im not getting to that point until we get to that if in fact thats the case
5864423 i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers at and id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that from my understanding and i dont have a big background in medical physiology these things happen over a long period of time so the rapport that ive had with george personally the rapport that george has had with pitching coach rick kranitz and bullpen coach alan dunn i think has been a very clear and open line of communication i did not particularly see this coming but im not totally shot out of the water by it
5864424 i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates
5864425 our doctors have pretty much recommended that he rest some more
5864426 well just try to match up the best way we can
5864427 the thing that i want to be careful of is anointing someone as the closer and then that doesnt work out
5864428 the only reason billy wagner is billy wagner is because when i blew a save they put me back out there the next day
5864429 its totally a feeling of youre the guy thats going to get the ball regardless of who you are and what you did yesterday
5864430 the relief pitchers determine the role everybody gets an opportunity to get out there and see what they can do however they do it if they do it well theyll get another opportunity and its not always result based its how you compete
5864431 when we were intact we were a good team a very good team
5864432 but we had four or five major injuries at the same time and thats why were where we are right now thats baseball that kind of stuff happens but it doesnt change the fact that this is a good young team thats only going to get better
5864433 ive always said i want to play until im 41 or 42
5864434 all i can do is work as hard as i can to keep this old body in shape
5864435 but the desire is still there the hunger to be a great player im not playing this game for money never have
5864436 i see the pitching here and thats what its all about
5864437 thats what i saw when i was with the blue jays and the potential is still here
5864438 i love it here i loved it when i was here in 2006 and i still do all the young guys here it keeps me young too
5864439 its been a long year for me because i had that and my daughter who was 11 months old at the time had a tumor on her spine and she ended up having a cancerous tumor taken off
5864440 it was kind of crazy and not what you want to go through with your first kid when theyre 11 months old
5864441 at the time it was kind of a blessing that i was injured the way i was because that gave me time to address that
5864442 so for the most part i havent been home pining about where i was going to end up and how i was going to get there
5864443 no ones ever really ready for that kind of stuff that goes on in your life but when you have those circumstances you deal with it and it puts a different spin or perspective on everything else
5864444 there was some uncertainty whether i was going to be able to come back so to be able to be here im definitely happy
5864445 hes been a big part of the lineup over the years here
5864446 his at bats are always good and hes a professional hitter you dont worry about left handers or right handers against him he makes your lineup deeper and we look forward to him staying healthy for the last month and a half here
5864447 he usually does very well in the big spots his at bats are very good i know he hasnt played in almost two months but im a believer that its not going to hurt him i believe that hes going to come out and be strong for us
5864448 i still wanted to contribute and be a strength of this team
5864449 i want to be part of helping this team win a championship there was part of me that believed i could still make it back that controlled my decision
5864450 being an orioles fan really paid off im as excited about the season tickets as i am about the 50 000 because it means ill be able to come to even more games
5864451 obviously we cant wait to play the astoria as its something weve wanted to do since we became a band
5864452 we are all petrified as to whether or not well be able to fill the venue but weve never done things the normal way so well just have to see
5864453 it will be launched in a phased manner across the country
5864454 the aim is to cover 10 000 faculty by the year 2010
5864455 theres another one too buddy black our old pitching coach now managing the padres we used to talk about it every year when he was here
5864456 in a lot of ways it doesnt mean anything im not really into astrology but it is interesting to think about
5864457 phelps took it all the way to the top beyond what others believed possible
5864458 tyson banged his way to the top from a rough youth in brooklyn ill probably be the last one to know i cant play anymore
5864459 you have to have your own mind whether its the truth or not
5864460 you have to take that frame of mind that youre going to accomplish what you set out to accomplish
5864461 its like with brett favre you earn that right to call your own shot he can still do it why should you stop doing what you love to do
5864462 rex it has nothing to do with arguing you could have seen if i was alright
5864463 you left me here all by myself and i couldnt sleep an inch all you were interested in was being by yourself having fun in there
5864464 i think it would be so cool for me to have cause my
5864465 i think it would be so cool for me to have cause my
5864466 while convenience is great we want to make sure our moves in the mobile market cause no damage to the brand
5864467 we have and will continue to implement a comprehensive end to end security model
5864468 its 24 7 its potentially developable all over the country all over the world and for all that we really do think it could be the killer app of the energy world
5864469 if you drill deep enough anywhere you can get to hot rock
5864470 i wont divulge too many secrets here but well focus on providing simple calling plans integrating all our services into one device with a consistent cross platform interface and making our content and applications mobile
5864471 dear god these are your hands now dont go an embarrass yourself
5864472 it is a test of a good religion whether you can make a joke of your praying
5864473 would i have to visit colleges dressed up as a giant tampon
5864474 could i dress up as a giant tampon if i wanted to
5864475 ah yes ive seen this happen a hundred times the problem is with your snarselflap thatll be 500 to get it back working again
5864476 huh ive never seen that before i wonder what the e means the e means that there is no film in the camera but i let them do their thing thats a weird one sorry
5864477 gee ive never seen that problem before it must be bad
5864478 you have many sources to know what you want to know but dont ask me anything
5864479 the rule is you cant send someone back to face torture
5864480 i wonder how he got them to lie so still
5864481 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5864482 thats happened to me twice in my career and believe me its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back or wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back from what happened this offseason
5864483 believe me i wanted to win the game but i give them a tremendous amount of credit and respect
5864484 thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed
5864485 im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league and were just trying to get better this week
5864486 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
5864487 if im going to come out here and practice i want to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it and whatever eric wants to do we havent really talked about it
5864488 for the most part its the things that people dont see that weve got to get on board with in a hurry
5864489 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using a term thats already in place or maybe coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things i mean its a work in progress and i think thatll be the case all year long
5864490 in our 2 minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try
5864491 we kind of just turned it loose today we did good on a couple and didnt do quite as well on the other ones the good thing is that it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections
5864492 i said well theres no substitute for game type situations the 2 minute drills red zone situations third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in
5864493 i mean you can never really get a full or a great assessment just by playing a few plays here a quarter
5864494 once the pre season is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on
5864495 we cant really gauge by how the season may go just by the way the pre season goes
5864496 my goal is different my mentality in a sense is i want to win a super bowl but we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
5864497 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
5864498 i just tried to make the best of the opportunities that were thrown at me
5864499 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the eagles i told the coach if i am on the field treat me as if i am 100 per cent i dont think the cowboys did that at that time
5864500 a quick count amongst engadget eds reveals at least 10 broken canon digicams and we know were not outside the curve have you felt our pain
5864501 being around the guys is a real good distraction its helped take my mind off everything i love what i do its a good opportunity to do what my dad would have wanted me to do
5864502 i got plenty of stuff in saturday and sunday without a doubt
5864503 i did a lot of extra everything im really happy i got those two pinch hit at bats
5864504 i think he said he watched almost every game it was part of his routine every day hed go to work my dad was a hard worker one of those guys that did it every single day hed come home and look forward to watching me every day
5864505 everything seems to be going as well as could be expected the doctors told us it went perfect she got to go home today so thats a good sign
5864506 you couldnt put a bullet or a needle in a worse spot to where the infection is
5864507 he was up and down emotionally obviously i think the whole team was i was hes almost like another son to me it was tough for everybody
5864508 hed probably be there until we get his shoulder straight and until he starts to feel better its still a little sore at times
5864509 the rehab is pretty intense digging pretty deep into the shoulder and the capsule trying to loosen up some tissue
5864510 when were doing that and im trying to play and swing a baseball bat at the same time were kind of counteracting what were doing
5864511 if we give it time to cool down a little bit and get in there and dig and get after that without having to swing the bat and undo it thats hopefully going to help it recover a little better
5864512 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5864513 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5864514 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5864515 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5864516 it was not an easy choice because rio ferdinand is a very important player
5864517 i like him as a captain he is very good but i chose john because we need a captain with a big personality
5864518 it showed the kind of character i am to the manager to come back and bounce back from what had been a big disappointment to myself
5864519 maybe that persuaded him the manager gave me a big boost by giving me the armband
5864520 i played well and scored the goal and it helped remove a small bit of the heartache
5864521 and now were talking about a chance to win the fedex cup
5864522 the tour said they wanted more volatility but are they setting themselves up for a guy like me
5864523 have i had a better year than kenny perry or padraig harrington no but the playoffs arent all about who had the best year its who is playing well in the playoffs the new york giants certainly were not the best team in the league but they won the super bowl
5864524 i seem to be the biggest procrastinator in the world when it means something
5864525 its a wonder i ever got married and had kids but you know they give you 42 weeks just because i waited until the last week doesnt bother me im elated to be where im at
5864526 he came to my house and basically was talking about how to peak how to go to a big time event and produce your best performance
5864527 he was obviously a very talented competitor himself and knew what to do but was feeling that he was slightly underachieving at the big events
5864528 the only way to learn experience without actually going through it yourself is learn from somebody else
5864529 kenny was not afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me and i love to talk so i was more than obliging
5864530 the following day they went out and lost to carlow which is one of the favorite teams losing to one of the lower down teams so it was a bit of an upset
5864531 i wouldnt say i have a 100 percent record in these things but it is great to see kenny doing so well
5864532 hopefully i can make the team if i can play well here this week and next week
5864533 id like to make the team outright i still think i need to play well this week and next week to get a pick i would like to qualify on my own terms
5864534 ive done it in europe and it would be very nice to do it in the states
5864535 they want greg normans and fred couples and tiger woods they dont want guys youve never heard of
5864536 its supposed to be a human sport yet theres equestrians going on there i think golf would be a great thing for the olympics
5864537 today when i woke up i could actually sit up in bed rather than roll out the side and fall on my face
5864538 its not 100 per cent that hell be ready but its not 100 per cent that hell have an operation
5864539 weve got that in between those two weeks to find out
5864540 this decision will serve as a specific and general deterrent and send a clear message that the commission expects strict compliance with its cease trade orders
5864541 i was just ecstatic going on off a walk off at the little league world series
5864542 i was thinking that i had to shorten up my swing and get a hit so we could win
5864543 not many kids can say they played at the little league world series playing against the top teams in the united states
5864544 give me a hand hold and ill raise the earth
5864545 the railway line between baku and batumi oil port is not usable at the moment
5864546 our timing was excellent in gaining copper and more energy exposure and the 15 international companies in the fund are now headquartered in 12 different countries germany mexico australia brazil japan india switzerland netherlands norway israel peru and the united kingdom
5864547 ya he won 8 gold medals but hes still not as good as me
5864548 hi michael what would you do to beat the boston celtics
5864549 well kobe i would probably try to play for a team that isnt so overrated
5864550 michael phelps its where 8 gold medals and no rape accusations happens
5864551 man i know like three guys down at liberty city pool that could smoke his ass right now and i am one of them
5864552 junte se a n s criando um v deo projeto global nico para o
5864553 whats different is the diversity i could be with a minor league guy trying to get ready for big league spring training and my next lesson is a 5 year old boy that doesnt even know how to hold a bat its pretty challenging its a blast
5864554 we just dont have quite the same amount of space
5864555 for the most part we struggled for a few years but ill tell you one thing we had a great group of guys we came to the ballpark we had an awful lot of fun
5864556 probably the biggest thing was that we had a bunch of really good players that cared about each other and cared about winning we wouldnt let each other fail i found that incredibly unique its a one of a kind group of guys
5864557 very smart he had a huge heart i was just proud that i got to spend a whole day with him and im touched by the fact that he came to my apartment and spent quality time its something that ill be inspired by for the rest of my life
5864558 if i was able to make one person realize how anything can be taken away in one swift swipe then sort of my word got spread
5864559 the young people obama seems to be reaching out to are such a visually oriented generation they might say who
5864560 i would just appreciate thats who he chose and im still for obama so it doesnt really matter
5864561 its not going to change anything for me as long as he wins i dont care who it is hillary biden bayh
5864562 i didnt want to pop anything up i just wanted to get a hit so we could win
5864563 they played hard all the way up to this point
5864564 moving on to the semis now were gonna go up against a good team in hawaii
5864565 its a great feeling knowing youre moving on in the little league world series
5864566 match gt using default parameters interaction interfaces were analysed using the pisa web server human embryonic kidney 293 hek 293 cells 1 10 5
5864567 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5864568 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5864569 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5864570 dancap has failed to meet the test for an interlocutory injunction
5864571 it seems to me that dancap seeks to obtain the rights to control the sale of the theatres through this motion
5864572 it did not negotiate for this right in the term sheet
5864573 our position was validated by the judge and he seems to have accepted all of our arguments
5864574 he says that key brand has the right to sell and that we have a binding agreement to purchase
5864575 id like to spend my time in the theatres not in the courts
5864576 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5864577 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5864578 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5864579 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5864580 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5864581 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5864582 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
5864583 i just told her youre on the back burner you are the dark horse step out into the light change it all
5864584 we were the underdogs nobody expected anything out of all three of us
5864585 and for us to go out there and place 1 2 3 and prove to the world that we are here and we are competitors its such an exciting feeling
5864586 i feel like ive jumped out of my body and gone to heaven and back this is a dream thats become a reality of mine
5864587 it was so close from my angle i couldnt really tell
5864588 it just started flashing photo finish photo finish photo finish for what seemed like about 10 days
5864589 this is the pinnacle of sports to be an olympic medallist thats more impressive than a super bowl ring
5864590 there were no words just screams but we knew what we were saying to each other in those screams
5864591 i knew they were on the sixth hurdle so when i ran around the track and got to that sixth hurdle mark i was looking around for them and they were just swinging the canadian flag back and forth
5864592 a lot of people didnt think she could do it a lot of people didnt think she should have been here in the first place but she actually went out there and proved the whole world wrong
5864593 my thing to her when we got here was theres three cookies in the jar just get one
5864594 he said run over the hurdles and i said are you crazy no way i did it
5864595 the second time i went over the hurdles i wiped out so hard i took off the first layer of epidermis on my left shoulder but i was like i dont care i want to hurdle now i had the taste for it
5864596 its a dream come true that was my big goal to make the final and hopefully crack top 12 and get a little more experience and just belong with these girls i believe i belong now
5864597 making it to top 12 oh my goodness my goal this year was to make it here so this is amazing to make it to the final
5864598 i was comfortable with 6 61 metres i thought that would get me through
5864599 it was tough its so late in the night you really have to control your emotions throughout the day but i feel like i put in a pretty good effort
5864600 im not pleased with the time but i think ultimately i learned a lot
5864601 we lit up your world like the fourth of july
5864602 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5864603 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5864604 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5864605 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5864606 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5864607 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5864608 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5864609 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5864610 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5864611 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5864612 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5864613 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5864614 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5864615 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5864616 yesterday it was bothering him a little bit and it didnt get any better overnight
5864617 well just give him a day to treat it and were hopeful hes ready to go tomorrow
5864618 its day to day we treat it every day i do my stretching and take it from there
5864619 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5864620 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5864621 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5864622 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tar sands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5864623 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5864624 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5864625 lultimo fatto solo la cresta dellonda afferma lincoln non che la punta delliceberg
5864626 case e negozi sono stati bruciati o abbattuti coi bulldozer le persone vengono picchiate e rapite i cimiteri bah vengono arati e membri della comunit bah che per decenni hanno lavorato alle dipendenze dello stato iraniano ed ora sono in pensione si vedono chiedere la restituzione della pensione che hanno ricevuto adesso c stato questultimo incidente limprigionamento di sette nostri esponenti che rappresentavano la principale fonte di notizie su quanto va accadendo laggi a quanto pare i funzionari iraniani non vogliono che si venga a sapere della persecuzione in atto
5864627 sebbene la fede bah sia contraria a portare armi il dovere civico fa premio sulla nostra avversione per ogni forma di violenza
5864628 come le giovani acacie appena c un alito di vento si muovo e scricchiolano proprio come unalbero
5864629 la vita cos grande che quando sarai sul punto di morire pianterai un ulivo convinto ancora di vederlo fiorire
5864630 astounded to see that the measure could predict aggressive behaviour in a real world setting
5864631 if someone was given the choice of one of two opponents to compete against who differed on the basis of the facial metric would the facial metric predict the less aggressive opponent
5864632 think of it like using a flame thrower to get real estate
5864633 if something like this wrecks the balance of an ecosystem once its likely to happen again
5864634 real programmers just throw a bunch of 1s and 0s at the computer to see what sticks

5864649 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5864650 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5864651 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5864652 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5864653 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
5864654 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5864655 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5864656 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5864657 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing
5864658 development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
5864659 meet the needs of a much larger but stabilizing human population sustain the life support systems of the planet and substantially reduce hunger and poverty
5864660 its barbaric unnecessary its gratuitous cruelty and i dont believe most canadians would want to be associated with this type of redneck event
5864661 its easier to make a mistake when youre trying to sever the animals head if youre partying and drinking
5864662 if the animals head isnt severed its possible that they could be experiencing extreme pain and suffering
5864663 i would encourage these people to give vegetarian options a try
5864664 we are against the act of organizing something that amuses people over the death of an animal
5864665 the chicken killings take about 10 or 15 minutes out of the whole day
5864666 we kill them ourselves and we cook them on the barbecue everything is eaten that night
5864667 they didnt believe me so they tried it and thats how it started
5864668 the hen doesnt suffer we cut off the head in one shot

5864670 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it this platform we are at today sits above a field of 160 million barrels of oil and is capable of producing on a daily basis 55 000 barrels of oil and 72 million cubic feet of natural gas
5864671 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution
5864672 it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig
5864673 potential for loss of life and damage to the environment
5864674 for three decades as our energy crisis grew decision making in washington has been rigged against our national interests and the interests of american consumers
5864675 and for almost that long sen mccain has been part of the problem for decades he has stood with the big oil companies and voted against the development of the alternative energy we need when a critical proposal came before the senate late last year that would have provided tax incentives for the development of alternative energy by revoking 13 billion in giveaways to the oil companies he was the only senator who didnt vote and we came up one vote short

5864678 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5864679 yes we have been sued by emi but not for failing to deliver music or for quitting we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here wed rather not air any dirty laundry but basically our representatives could not get emi to agree to make a fair and reasonable deal
5864680 emis relationship with 30stm has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5864681 but it s about an intersexual girl how could it be serious
5864682 buy our new record itll make you want to punch a dolphin in the blowhole
5864683 this song was inspired by chris hanson of to catch a predator its easy for us white folks to dance to

5864692 these are the hottest inflation figures seen since mid 1981
5864693 they are commodity driven they are putting the squeeze on companies and ultimately they are putting the squeeze on consumers
5864694 given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward it is likely that businesses will have increasing difficulty raising prices to consumers
5864695 while we pay close attention to this report its important to look at longer trends
5864696 the data today doesnt reflect the recent significant fall in oil prices which everyone would like to see continue
5864697 with sales still soft and with lending standards tighter single family housing starts will contract even further
5864698 housings contribution to economic growth will be significantly negative again in the third quarter
5864699 it will be a while before the housing industry completes its transition and housing prices stabilise
5864700 once prices stabilise and demand catches up to supply we would expect to see a return in housing construction
5864701 significant economic weakness makes it unlikely for the fed to push up interest rates this year
5864702 lower crude oil prices should help pull producer inflation much lower
5864703 ok i get it i know why you never answer the phone
5864704 i dont even know how you think in this house
5864705 need to fight every once in a while for one at bat throughout a game one or two so maybe it will start coming together
5864706 i am starting to become concerned again we are not coming out of the housing slump
5864707 lower rates and time are not fixing the credit crisis we are about to begin what looks like a prolonged journey to the bottom of the economic sea and it is hard to find a happy face on wall street
5864708 the real issue is that their liabilities divided by their assets are overwhelming from fannie and freddie to lehman theres no signs of stability

5864713 ist es so dass alles was wir tun aus angst vor einsamkeit getan wird ist es deswegen dass wir auf all die dinge verzichten die wir am ende des lebens bereuen werden ist das der grund weshalb wir so selten sagen was wir denken weshalb sonst halten wir an all diesen zerr tteten ehen verlogenen freundschaften langweiligen geburtstagsessen fest was gesch he wenn wir all das aufk ndigten der schleichenden erpressung ein ende setzten und zu uns selbst st nden wenn wir unsere geknechteten w nsche und die wut ber ihre versklavung hochgehen liessen wie eine font ne denn die bef rchtete einsamkeit worin besteht sie eigentlich in der stille ausbleibender vorhaltungen in der fehlenden notwendigkeit mit angehaltenem atem ber das mineneld ehelicher l gen und freundschaftlicher halbwahrheiten zu schleichen in der freiheit beim essen niemanden gegen berzuhaben in der f lle der zeit die sich auftut wenn das trommelfeuer der verabredungen verstummt ist sind das nicht wundervolle dinge ein paradiesischer zustand weshalb also die furcht davor ist es am ende eine furcht die nur besteht weil wir ihren gegenstand nicht durchdacht haben eine furcht die uns von gedankenlosen eltern lehrern und priestern eingeredet worden ist und warum sind wir eigentlich so sicher dass uns die anderen nicht beneideten wenn sie s hen wie gross unsere freiheit geworden ist und dass sie nicht daraufhin unsere gesellschaft suchten

5864737 it is a great achievement for me i am very proud my target now is to qualify for the world cup
5864738 it makes me proud to think managers like capello mourinho and scolari have given it to me it makes me feel very special with the players i was competing with it is extra special i am absolutely delighted and we have got to make the most of it
5864739 the manager gave me a huge boost when he told me i was going to be captain and hopefully ive repaid him ive shown that im a big man i take full responsibility for what happened in moscow but im a man for the big games and ive shown that
5864740 as he calls it within the next twelve months it is true that one has to be confronted with the real need of the world before one can really become inspired to make a difference

5864855 they understand when we explain what we do were a business and were here to entertain investors were not a place for hospitality
5864856 at the olympics the u s plays well but the dutch have good parties
5864857 its just how the dutch are the space between people is much smaller
5864858 if i were in the u s youd think he was my boyfriend

5864862 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
5864863 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
5864864 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
5864865 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
5864866 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
5864867 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
5864868 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
5864869 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
5864870 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie
5864871 and how do i make enough money to support the kind of lifestyle i want while at the same time doing something that is meaningful and enjoyable without the 9 5 routine i so detest i would have hoped that by the age of 45 i would have figured it out
5864872 this is a perfect show for us to end the season with
5864873 we opened the season with babes in arms a romantic musical about young idealistic love in the early 20th century and were ending with a hilarious cabaret style musical about love in the modern era
5864874 these are four incredibly talented young professionals with credits that include broadway off broadway regional theatre and film
5864875 and the brewster academy boathouse is a lovely location for us to celebrate one of our most successful seasons ever
5864876 this is a wonderful family that has really gone all out to support the arts and charitable organizations
5864877 were really pleased to be able to honor them with our business in the arts award
5864878 great music great food and great views make for the perfect sunday to relax with friends
5864879 this is a wonderful fun filled fundraising event for the miss nh scholarship fund the mount washington cruise lines have remained a valued sponsor for us
5864880 im john terry i can park where i want why should i walk an extra two feet into the store when i can be lazy and make it easier for myself
5864881 i think some people might shy away from it because they normally dont file the income tax and this year they must get that return sent in to be eligible for that stimulus payment
5864882 we have billions of barrels of oil under our soil and we have just made it 100 percent off limits because of those extreme policies that the speaker has bought into
5864883 stop stalling and drill on the off shore and on land leases they now have
5864884 this is a political stunt from a guy who along with the two oil men in the white house did nothing for eight years but protect the profits of the big oil and gas companies
5864885 clearly they have a lot of work to do on the report
5864886 we would expect subsequent versions would have additional and greater details
5864887 this is the first time weve had to put this report out and this was the easiest way to do it
5864888 once we found out it was confidential and couldnt be used we knew we had to come up with something else we want to be in compliance with the law
5864889 obesity is probably the largest public health problem facing our country and has the most dramatic impact on the conditions that are driving escalating health care costs
5864890 we are now at two thirds of the country overweight or obese some forecasts say that within the next decade that will be 75 percent people are not leading as healthy lives as they could
5864891 i look around my community and this obesity thing is out of control
5864892 we are just now getting more into implementation where we are seeing things happen
5864893 but we are going to see changes in some of the target behaviors before we see changes in obesity rates
5864894 the more people we have working on it the farther we get down the road
5864895 funding over the last few years has been going down for obesity efforts
5864896 if we take seriously the notion that this is a major public health crisis we need to invest more money
5864897 we live in a society that does not encourage or promote the kind of behavior that makes a difference
5864898 we have to do a better job of helping them make healthy choices
5864899 if you go into a restaurant and have to guess what is the healthier choice thats not the place to be if you are in a community without sidewalks thats not a place to be but when we make it easier for people to make healthy choices thats a different story

5864962 what i can confirm is that chief walters did receive a disciplinary action that was a suspension without pay
5864963 i think ill let his personnel file speak for the remainder of it
5864964 obviously i am very disappointed that he would choose to take such action but i think the response by the county administrator speaks volumes
5864965 that is nothing that i have anything to do with
5864966 at the time i did not know he was suspended
5864967 we could have provided clean energy for a million homes or reduced our dependence on foreign oil
5864968 instead john mccain and elizabeth dole allowed big oil companies to keep 13 5 billion in tax breaks
5864969 and they are welcome to spend more that dog aint gonna hunt down here these are the same surrender monkeys that called for a peaceful response to the 9 11 attacks that killed nearly 3 000 americans their credibility in north carolina is pretty low

5864972 homes became more affordable because median income and interest rates remained about the same throughout the country as home prices continued to fall
5864973 this is definitely positive news because more people can afford to buy a home
5864974 still actual sales havent picked up because people are waiting on the sidelines as they fear home prices will continue to decline
5864975 prices went down a lot in both areas but they fell a lot more in los angeles

5865049 hey did you know that most gueros white people dont think theyre a race
5865050 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
5865051 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5865052 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5865053 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5865054 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5865055 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5865056 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5865057 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5865058 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5865059 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going

5865188 tidakkah engkau redha bahawa engkau menjadi di sisiku kedudukannya sama dengan kedudukan harun di sisi musa kecuali sesungguhnya tidak ada lagi seorang nabi sesudahku
5865189 aku akan berikan besok panji panji kepada seorang lelaki yang cintakan allah dan rasul menyintainya
5865190 katakanlah kepada mereka marilah kita mengajak anak anak kami dan anak anak kamu perempuan perempuan kami dan perempuan perempuan kamu diri diri kami dan diri diri kamu kemudian kita bermubahalah
5865191 jika sekiranya diletakkan gergaji di atas kepalaku untuk aku mencaci ali aku tidak mencacinya sama sekali selama lamanya
5865192 sesungguhnya muawiyah telah berkata kepada saad bin abi waqqas apakah yang menghalangmu dari mencaci aba turab
5865193 para ulama telah berkata bahawa hadis hadis yang telah diriwayatkan itu adalah pada lahirnya menyentuh para sahabat rasululah s a w a wajib ditakwilkannya mereka berkata ianya tidak ada di dalam riwayat riwayat yang siqaat kepercayaan maka pertanyaan muawiyah ini tidak menunjukkan pengertian yang jelas padanya bahawa sesungguhnya ia menyuruh saad mencaci ali r a tetapi hanyasanya ia muawiyah telah bertanya kepadanya saad tentang halangan baginya untuk mencaci seolah olah ia berkata adakah engkau telah terhalang disebabkan oleh kerendahan diri atau takut atau selain daripada yang demikian itu jika sekiranya kerana kerendahan diri dan kebesaran tentang membuat cacian maka engkau betul dan baik tetapi sekiranya selain daripada yang demikian itu maka baginya jawapan yang lain pula dan boleh jadi saad sesungguhnya telah berada dalam satu golongan yang mereka itu mencaci ali r a maka ia tidak bersama sama dengan mereka dan tidak mampu untuk mengingkarinya ataupun mengingkari terhadapnya dengan itu ia telah bertanya tentang soalan ini mereka juga para ulama telah membuat andaian dengan dua takwil yang lain iaitu maknanya apakah yang menghalangmu untuk menyalahkannya di dalam perkara pandangan dan ijtihadnya maka zahirkah kebaikan terhadap manusia akan tetapi pandangan kami dan ijtihad kami ini adalah sesungguhnya salah

5865195 t he prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects
5865196 an angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before god
5865197 bless the lord o you his angels you mighty ones who do his word hearkening to the voice of his word bless the lord all his hosts his ministers that do his will
5865198 praise the lord praise the lord from the heavens praise him in the heights praise him all his angels praise him all his host
5865199 see that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my father who is in heaven
5865200 but not the high priest christ alone prays for those who pray sincerely but also the angels as also the souls of the saints who have already fallen asleep rom 6 3 4 or are you unaware that we who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death we were indeed buried with him through baptism into death so that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father we too might live in newness of life col 2 12 you were buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead pray at all times in the spirit with all prayer and supplication to that end keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all the saints the saints and also for me that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains that i may declare it boldly as i ought to speak
5865201 first of all then i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men for kings and all who are in high positions that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life godly and respectful in every way this is good and it is acceptable in the sight of god our savior who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
5865202 for there is one god and there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
5865203 i urge that supplications prayers intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men
5865204 this is good and it is acceptable in the sight of god our savior
5865205 then one of the elders who represent the hierarchy of the people of god in heaven addressed me saying who are these clothed in white robes and whence have they come i said to him sir you know and he said to me these are they who have come out of the great tribulation they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb
5865206 then the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ this tells us these are the voices of humans and he shall reign for ever and ever
5865207 and the twenty four elders who sit on their thrones before god fell on their faces and worshipped god saying we give thanks to thee lord god almighty who art and who wast that thou hast taken thy great power and begun to reign
5865208 and i heard a loud voice in heaven saying now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ have come for the accuser of our brethren this indicates it is a human voice has been thrown down who accuses them day and night before our god
5865209 and onias spoke saying this is a man who loves the brethren and prays much for the people and the holy city jeremiah the prophet of god

5865245 this is what irks me about obama he takes his time in announcing his vp pick and lets the media clamour all over themselves to get the scoop
5865246 because i love my son and i am obligated to make the best choice for him i will vote for senator clinton on november 4th even if i have to write her name in
5865247 they have not been telling the truth and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5865248 to advance the unity of working people to be a voice to be reckoned with by the obama administration which to me at this point looks like will be an overwhelming landslide victory over the republicans
5865249 you are disowning everything frank marshall davis wrote who cares about the use of the term mentor look in any dictionary you are quibbling about terms that mean the same no matter who uses them how come you havent taken issue with the editor of the books john edgar tidwell and the publishers university of wisconsin press and university press of mississippi i think you should contact the editor and publishers and have them either stand behind what has been written or disown it as you are fully aware if you have ever read either of the two books the only thing i have done is quote the books and say the same thing the editor has stated
5865250 if there is one thing frank marshall davis makes clear is that he had the utmost respect for communists because of the way communists fight for the rights of working people and against racism frank marshall davis was entitled to his political views there is no doubt he joined the ranks of members of the communist party usa along with his very good friends benjamin davis and paul robeson for you to deny this is cowardly shameful and disgusting
5865251 after calling the publishers of daviss books they said they never heard from anyone in the family upset with anything in the books nor is the family contesting anything in the books
5865252 i have had leanings in that direction i e marxism since i was in college
5865253 this was of course consistent with the line of the communist party during the soviet nazi alliance against national defense
5865254 about november 1950 the communist party in hawaii was reorganized on an underground basis in the new organization party groups were to consist of not more than three members groups were identified by numbers 1 10 rather than by names as formerly
5865255 we find that there is no substance to these claims
5865256 i would suggest that you take up your concerns with barack obama who first brought frank marshall davis to our attention
5865257 what you know about politics and its history could fill a thimble
5865258 your feeble attempts at a coherent argument for your candidate which have been conspicuously absent thus far are only dwarfed by your pathetic blah blah blah blah
5865259 sorry we got you excited but we need a candidate we think can win maybe next time love ya
5865260 oh no hes too liberal it will be two liberals
5865261 izz writing in senator clintons name in november is relevant because
5865262 because she is the best choice among the 3 candidates
5865263 obama cannot pick a vp that has more experience then him that only leaves one of the jonas brothers as a viable candidate
5865264 fanneys got size he s got a much better understanding of what hes got to do he was very productive in the scrimmage we hope that he continues his development
5865265 were going to have to determine eight to 10 freshmen who will have some kind of role on our team he said

5865267 they may make some mistakes early but in the long run it will help our team
5865268 maybe you ought to ask the guy that leaked them out

5865272 as for sewer and water lines some wont actually be evaluated probably until they start to dig it up and replace it but nonetheless with the presidential declaration theyre going to be all right theyre going to be able to do that even without the money knowing full well theyre going to get the money
5865273 the bands represented here are of a kindred diy spirit
5865274 i should qualify thats the old kind of diy not the newer remanufactured cable tv version one might find at a big polished megacorporate event were basically a corridor specific regional occurrence with an emphasis on fun
5865275 ive liked them for a while and penn state is in the big 10 itd be a lot of fun to come back and play minnesota
5865276 he was kind of preloaded on his back leg cause his back leg kind of turned in so he doesnt over rotate on the backside and then that creates kind of a long upper cut swing and what hes doing is that hes pretty loaded so he can get on top of the ball better
5865277 mike is a good guy hard worker great shooter and i think minnesota is lucky to have him good guy all around not only can he play but got a great personality and he works hard and hes definitely a team guy and i think hell be great for the timberwolves
5865278 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5865279 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5865280 were trying to wait and see and make sure everythings right before we get to the season
5865281 hopefully if i get enough rest before it really gets as serious as it did last year then ill be good by the season
5865282 its tender so hes mixing the treatment with the football and doing what he can do but thats a number of our guys trying to work through
5865283 just not really do anything just sit around and catch up on some sleep
5865284 ive been getting text messages and reading the newspaper and seeing and hearing all of the support back in the u s and im just excited to get home
5865285 one of the biggest things im looking forward to is catching a ravens game
5865286 without my teammates none of this would have been possible i have some pretty amazing teammates we made history
5865287 you have to be ready to go in and you have to play like youve been working with the first team all year
5865288 we give him a hard time for his age but when youre on the field that ball definitely has a young guy pop
5865289 thats the thing that gets your attention when youre first looking at him last winter
5865290 thats the first place you always go before the feet or anything like that you say does he still have an arm can he still make all the throws what you see him do is throw from a lot of different platforms whether its straight over the top or three quarters or submarine i kid him about throwing it submarine style sometimes
5865291 i think its just part of my mechanics now being able to make throws from different angles
5865292 i dont want to sound cocky but theres not many
5865293 ive seen guys do 10 000 more reps than i have and done band work and everything but i can still come out and throw the ball so its just something that i was given its like a guy being able to jump through the roof its just a god given ability
5865294 its been a really great career and really a lot of fun
5865295 its been hard at times and sometimes you feel its not always fair and youve just got to move on from that one good thing i have is a great family and a good support system it really helps me get through anything that could go wrong if you get cut or anything like that it makes you realize its still a business just thank god im 37 and still being able to do what i love to do i have a lot of friends in the nfl who havent been as lucky
5865296 and i really want to make sure that people understand the dire situation that many farmers face
5865297 if we can get these extraordinary circumstances areas reviewed quickly itll them some comfort that at least they have some chance of surviving economically over the next 18 months
5865298 in the last few days ive been meeting farmers in the bothwell region of tasmania and the situation there at the moment is quite heartbreaking they really havent had much rain at all theyre down to very low stocking numbers and even if it rains for the next 3 or 4 months its still going to take some years for these guys to recover
5865299 initially the epa environment protection authority requested the information within a three month period and that then expired
5865300 they then gave them a further one months notice and unfortunately no comment no information was received from cleco nominees and therefore the epa had no other alternative but to suggest to council that the application should be refused
5865301 forward the above comment to 10 friends or else a piano will fall on you and youll be squished and die
5865302 the only grounds for going to court and asking for an injunction was procedural fairness that is the minister give the fmit an opportunity to be heard

5865309 david was a very obedient and peace loving child he was very caring and thoughtful of others
5865310 adieu my son your rainbow will never stop shining and you will forever be loved
5865311 i know i didnt always tell you that you was a good friend but deep down i think you knew because you were always asking if other people was all right and caring about other people thats what made me hold so much respect for you
5865312 and now ive only just realised how short life really is and its disgraceful how innocent young people like you and many others get killed for no reason

5865314 yes weve got some seed lined up straight away to start some production and get some containers on the water on the way to germany before next season
5865315 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
5865316 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
5865317 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees
5865318 we are excited to have been selected by sun and to contribute our solution to one of the most energy efficient and green data center sites in the country

5865320 requires lobbying organizations to disclose more information about their affiliates and members who pay for and participate in lobbying efforts
5865321 a person of substance would have presented himself to his fellow leaders among the pacific island countries to account for the undertaking he gave to them
5865322 what he has done is chicken out of that and i dont think that the leaders across the region will respond to that positively
5865323 there is the great and continuing challenge represented by the threat to democracy in fiji
5865324 there should be a lot of time spent on strengthening family bonds and on discussing issues that impact on the life of children
5865325 the adolescent stage of life is a challenging time for young people as they grapple with issues related to this transition period and its always best that parents keep an open communication link with their children in this regards
5865326 the holidays should also provide the opportunity for reflecting on the achievements of last term and working out strategies to improve on students performance in the final academic term
5865327 they have come to observe and share information on family life support and adolescent health
5865328 the mic is on and its back to school night

5865333 a total of 16 houses were built in the four villages with the materials and carpenters provided by government
5865334 the success of the project is also attributed to the people of cikobia who looked after our carpenters well this shows that community participation in these types of projects is vital
5865335 its like youve left kansas city and gone on vacation
5865336 but at the same time we felt bad because we realized that people were wasting something like 500 000 hours per day
5865337 computer scientists understandably are more interested in solving problems with algorithms than by figuring out clever ways to slice them into small pieces and let humans solve them
5865338 a much more likely path towards solving the problem of the polyglot internet than improved machine translation in my opinion
5865339 the discussion goes down the wrong path if we let ourselves think that the brain is like a timeshare computer that if not used optimally is a wasted resource
5865340 its no reason not to use them for good as well
5865341 they recycle they pick up litter theyll pick a penny or leave a penny
5865342 why did you have to do that man he didnt even do anything
5865343 he gave the gun back to the defendant and he stepped over the body and shot him again
5865344 this storm is going to be with us for a while
5865345 he didnt have just one chinese to beat tonight he had 10 000
5865346 zou has a lot of pressure because all the boxers know that he is the world champion
5865347 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
5865348 if he can get another one at this olympics it would mean a lot to the whole of russia
5865349 hopefully i can keep the fun rolling to the 2012 olympics in london
5865350 a lot of boxers want to go pro and win titles but for me the last three years have been all about winning a medal
5865351 everyone in prison will be sad as they watched me on the tv
5865352 restricts a persons freedom of choice of private health care systems or private plans of any type
5865353 we just think that health care reform has to have the rights that we lay out in our initiative as protected

5865355 warning electric stun devices used in this facility electric stun devices used in this facility
5865356 toward an inclusive medical community by tackling the cultural sensitivities of the navajo people many of whom are wary of modern medicine
5865357 many of our patients have told us theyre very pleased with how we honor their cultural diversity and how we respect and provide what they need to have a healing experience
5865358 its going to cause more havoc on our highways more health issues for our young people and its going backwards and we need to go forward and continue to save lives and the 21 drinking law has proven that
5865359 the longer you have the drinking age the higher up it goes it makes it more of a deal once you can drink
5865360 people tend to take too much of a big deal of it
5865361 i dont feel like that would help because kids drink
5865362 and theyre going to drink and probably if its legal more people would do it more openly
5865363 i would never want to be a member of a group whose symbol was a man nailed to two pieces of wood
5865364 most of the fires are small less than half an acre
5865365 if our initial attack efforts are successful we will prevent fires from becoming large fires
5865366 in the long run our initial attack success minimizes the likelihood of large fires and significantly reduces the costs of firefighting on the forest
5865367 once we get a better picture of how many fires and how large they are we will prioritize our efforts and order additional firefighting resources as we need them
5865368 it was owned by a businessman who is getting divorced
5865369 the court ordered it to be sold off and the proceeds divided between the husband and wife the auction starts at 10 a m and the building is sold to the highest bidder who puts 10 000 down that day and closes in 20 days
5865370 a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city
5865371 they were all at home hiding jews in the attic
5865372 we simply cannot allow mr ready to serve out his term even if that term were to expire next week we need to take action now and send a message that such behavior has no place in the republican party
5865373 but we are required by law to detect it which we did immediately and reported it to the state
5865374 if people want to blame me they should be free to do that
5865375 i will take full responsibility even though i am not there
5865376 it really contradicts the image he tries to portray on television
5865377 but at the end of the day when you work in agriculture working with millions of gallons of water to wash vegetables sometimes a pipe breaks and thats what happened
5865378 despite everything i still believe that people are good at heart
5865379 uh you finish that catch up with me when you are done

5865413 this was a major group of terrorists in suicide bomber form an attack on the coalition forces base and it was a major operation of the afghan national army commandos who succeeded in eliminating 10 suicide bombers before they could do anything
5865414 the taleban and al qaeda forces used heavy machine guns and other weapons they fired from mountains and gardens
5865415 theirs was a sacrifice not just for france but for all of us who want to help the afghan people build a better future
5865416 sua abordagem mais econ mica muito s ria e mostra ser uma boa iniciativa
5865417 we have some real concerns here and are hoping there can be a solution put in place that will do something to break the waves before they hit the cliff
5865418 then we will take it to the federal and provincial governments to help solve this problem financially
5865419 the town of souris will is putting up a lot of money for its sewer this year and it cant tack on this huge burden of shoring up the coastline
5865420 that in my mind would be a federal and provincial responsibility but that is down the road and we are taking this step by step
5865421 what we tried to do was work with them because we knew it was due to the tornado
5865422 we were working with them thinking they were applying for federal assistance to cleanup the property or to demo the buildings or whatever they wanted to do and they had not done anything
5865423 we have rodents in here we got children about 1 000 children who go to school right across the street and for the people who live in this community its a terrible thing
5865424 it helps out our kids they dont have to feel depressed going home everyday and looking at a place thats rat infested that has debris all over the place now theyre going to clean it up and hopefully well get it demolished real quick and we can move forward
5865425 he did not devote his full attention to duty i believe he was in violation of many other of our policies and those combined with the other allegations which will be forthcoming were enough information for me sunday night to make the decision to immediately separate him from employment
5865426 this home is not only built with lumber its built with a lot of love

5865434 bottom line we are as ready as we can be and we hope residents out there are doing the same
5865435 hopefully itll get better in a few weeks and go from there
5865436 surgery is definitely not on my lifetime check list so i dont want to end up going under hopefully i can get back on the field in a couple of weeks
5865437 today when i woke up i could actually sit up in bed rather than roll out the side and fall on my face
5865438 its not 100 percent that hell be ready but its not 100 percent that hell have an operation
5865439 weve got that in between those two weeks to find out
5865440 i mean you can never really get a full or a great assessment just by playing a few plays here a quarter
5865441 once the preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on
5865442 we cant really gauge by how the season may go just by the way the preseason goes
5865443 my goal is different my mentality in a sense is i want to win a super bowl but we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
5865444 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more
5865445 i just tried to make the best of the opportunities that were thrown at me
5865446 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the eagles i told the coach if i am on the field treat me as if i am 100 percent i dont think the cowboys did that at that time
5865447 those who are sworn to uphold the laws are equally bound to follow them
5865448 an injustice has been recognized and accepted by this former agents admission today
5865449 but when they happen we investigate it fully and hold them accountable to justice just like anyone else
5865450 math is not my favorite subject but i believe i can do better
5865451 hes just smart he understands the game and has got a lot of confidence hes an undersized guy so he works well in the slot our players just believe in him hes tough as hell and that helps
5865452 i dont know how we can keep him off the field right now to be honest with you
5865453 i had a better grasp of the offense i had a better grasp of what i could do better
5865454 it was just a matter of coming out letting it happen letting loose on the field
5865455 if you play scared or uncomfortable you kind of get exposed in the nfl
5865456 if youre on top of everything you do and play your best a lot of times you shine
5865457 youve got to make sure you dont mess up any routes
5865458 youve got to make plays when the ball is thrown in your direction and that you know all your assignments in the running game
5865459 some receivers are talented enough that they get away with barely having to block the rest of us have to make sure were on top of all our assignments
5865460 when you have a guy who you always know where hes going to be and always know hes going to be in the right spot it allows you to just let the ball go and trust what hes going to do and he always catches it he rarely has a drop
5865461 i guess thats the first step making that opening day roster the first and foremost goal then im just going from there
5865462 its easy to sit there and say well where does he fit in if andres back healthy youve got andre davis and kevin walter wheres david fit in
5865463 its our job as coaches to have him in position to help us win
5865464 the 2009 schedule reflects realigned dates that are good opportunities for everyone involved in our sport fans sponsors tracks and teams
5865465 from a weather standpoint i can hardly think of a better time to visit california than early october and we look forward to being part of the championship puzzle
5865466 weve been desiring a night race in atlanta for a number of years weve had a number of conversations and im sure mike helton can tell you about that
5865467 were bringing labor day racing back to the southeast and doing it with a nighttime event its a win win win situation for everybody
5865468 weve been a big part of the championship battle and we believe that moving even deeper into the chase makes talladega even more significant to the championship
5865469 also by moving to the end of october coupled with atlantas new date that separates our two events which is very beneficial for both parties
5865470 we appreciate the effort chris has put into this role however this is a performance oriented business when the results are not meeting the expectations we have to make changes
5865471 travis is another example of our willingness to promote from within his depth of knowledge as a racer and engineer as well as his proven ability to work with both drivers and crews will be a great addition to the entire mobil 1 team

5865480 there were a lot of bowing specific bowing and gestures that we really went through
5865481 temples are very important to them just like we have a lot of churches that are unique they were beautiful and historic
5865482 in my u s history class ill be able to teach the korean war looking at actually what happened and how effective it was in terms of where south korea is and north korea is because south korea is obviously more advanced
5865483 hes a hero of course he was a very articulate leader
5865484 he changed the way he presented his views on slavery
5865485 it changed my views on education because koreans take education extremely seriously
5865486 not just the students but the parents and teachers are very concerned about getting them into college and 80 percent of them go to college which is huge they study so much
5865487 he manifested his glory and his disciples came to believe in him
5865488 father the hour has come glorify your son that your son may also glorify you
5865489 from that hour the disciple took her to his own home
5865490 walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stands in the path of sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful

5865494 and you became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction en thlipsi with joy of the holy spirit
5865495 i know your works tribulation thlipsin and poverty but you are rich and the blasphemy of those who say they are jews and are not but are a synagogue of satan do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer indeed the devil is about to throw some of you into prison that you may be tested and you will have tribulation thlipsin ten days be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life

5865497 who will tell the mighty deeds of the lord or make all his praises heard
5865498 relax god has saved you you are home free once saved always saved dont worry about a thing above all no effort
5865499 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god
5865500 god is not mocked for whatever a man sows that he will also reap
5865501 with the holy spirit of promise who is the guarantee of our inheritance
5865502 grieve the holy spirit of god by whom you were sealed

5865506 what shall i render to the lord for all his benefits toward me i will take up the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the lord

5865512 when you understand that it is gods church and it is in gods hands it is very freeing and very helpful and will keep you off the emotional rollercoaster
5865513 you cannot look at somebody elses church plant and use it as a gauge for your own

5865515 if you are thinking that you are going to be the next willow creek or saddleback then i would advise you to get out now
5865516 some of the most valuable lessons that i can share with you have come from my failures mistakes and just bad decisions
5865517 if you think that you are going to march into an area where there has been no church presence and reach out to a bunch of people that have been living far from god and have not been in a relationship with jesus christ then you better think again it ticks the devil off when you decide to start reaching out and making a difference in the lives of people
5865518 be grateful for the things they did while they were with you
5865519 a church plant can be a mistress it is so consuming and takes up so much of who you are it is so much a personal reflection of who you are in your calling that you can get yourself into it to the neglect of your family

5865622 my democratic club votes on which delegates will be on the petition
5865623 it gives me an opportunity to see inside and out the people we select for supreme court judges
5865624 unless theres something really wrong with them the judicial picks are automatically becoming the nominees

5865667 it sure looks like these groups simply wanted to avoid the politically explosive issue of cove mallard
5865668 the betrayal of the wilderness society on this point is devastating
5865669 if the country need lumber and timber jobs the cove mallard isnt such a bad place to get it
5865670 the northern rockies chapter of the sierra club which covers all of idaho and some of eastern washington never opposed timber sales in the cove mallard because the area is mostly flat
5865671 basically the intent of the task force was to expedite timber sales in idaho roadless areas by circumventing nepa

5865679 i dont want to pick a fight with these guys
5865680 not only did gehrke help nullify an effective injunction that had stopped the cove mallard sale for at least a few more months
5865681 but he offended a friendly judge forced roselle and fullum to sacrifice themselves and show the opposition just how weak the national environmental groups really are
5865682 essentially what we need the government to do is get out of the way let the market system work get some certainly into the west side timber supply because we dont know whether to build another plant here to go to canada or even whether we should be hiring folks for a month from now because we cant be assured that our veneer supplier are going to have the raw material were going to need
5865683 the wilderness societys founders aldo leopold and bob marshall believed that progress in environmental protection required radical political and economic changes
5865684 but the new wilderness society through its repeated actions has refused to challenge a system where our public resources are controlled by renegade public agencies and multinational corporations a system that assumes that our natural resources exist solely for the purpose of making money the wilderness societys corporate motto is whatever you do dont offend anyone

5865709 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5865710 the reason there are casualties in afghanistan is because afghanistan particularly the afghanistan pakistan border area is the current hotbed of international terrorism
5865711 it is in our national interest to be there it is in the international communitys interest for there to be a concerted nato and other international community support in that effort

5865719 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to
5865720 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5865721 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5865722 for example just one per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5865723 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5865724 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5865725 recent trading for the australian casino businesses has been satisfactory with total revenue excluding vip commission based play to 14 august up four per cent on last year

5865727 the past year has been one of significant activity with the most important event being the separation of crown and pbl into two separately listed companies
5865728 this result was achieved despite the introduction of full smoking bans in bars on the main gaming floor and an increase in the victorian gaming machine levy during the year
5865729 crown melbourne and burswood further cemented their leadership position in the australian casino industry
5865730 just as we did with the test tour the department of foreign affairs and trade has been making available to cricket australia all of the up to date travel advice and threat assessments to help them make their own judgement

5865747 we will be discussing today and tomorrow the forum countries reaction to that
5865748 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
5865749 therefore that means holding to account those who violate that principle

5865890 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5865891 for people who are still hurting and not yet back in their homes a brighter day might seem impossible yet a brighter day is coming
5865892 i see more cranes in the sky in austin right now than i do in new orleans
5865893 i would say this to the president that i evacuated and went to beaumont and then to austin but i returned home to new orleans because i believed the promises he made from jackson square
5865894 we will do what it takes we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives
5865895 i was drinking at 16 or 17 but it was still hard to access it if you lower the age youre going to get kids 14 or 15

5865909 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5865910 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5865911 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5865912 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5865913 i know federal agents have been certainly aware of what happened subsequent to our meeting which is that the city attorney filed a lawsuit that fully and completely blocked my audit
5865914 the fact that the city attorney has blocked my attempt to do performance audits twice now makes me step back and ask whats he trying to hide
5865915 any allegation of wrongdoing is nothing more than garbage being shoveled by the citys attorneys political opponents hiding behind the cloak of anonymity
5865916 this is a classic political smear its one hell of a coincidence that this is coming out now when press accounts say he is considering a run for attorney general

5865921 each year they can only go home once or maximum twice for one or two days at a time
5865922 they are busy training or in competition some of the older athletes are married but for the countrys interests even they do not return home much
5865923 i miss my parents as i hardly ever go home but im used to it by now and it feels like home being here with my friends
5865924 my girlfriend left me as she couldnt see me or come to my dormitory

5865948 honestly i know nothing about cars explain my situation can i drive on this broken spare 10 blocks its not my tire so i dont care
5865949 nah you got about two to three months left easy on these
5865950 this is one of my favorite places for a quick lunch in oakland
5865951 the heritage the flavors and the feel of our east coast roots
5865952 was hesitant about trying another north beach restaurant but was pleased with this place due to one dish wild boar pasta is to live for and
5865953 i forgot do you happen to have any spare bones for our dog
5865954 the ultimate way to play hooky its after 3pm on a gorgeous and sunny afternoon
5865955 maybe she didnt get laid last night and got all pissy so thats why she gave us attitude
5865956 perch nessuno possa dimenticare che non si mai lontani abbastanza per trovarsi mai
5865957 nel senso che forse sempre e per tutti altro non mai leggere che fissare un punto per non essere sedotto e rovinati dallincontrollabile strisciare via del mondo
5865958 io questo lho capito che il mondo pieno di gente che gira con in tasca le sue piccole biglie di vetro le sue piccole tristi biglie infrangibili e allora tu non smetterla mai di soffiare nelle tue sfere di cristallo e se un giorno scoppieranno anche quella sar vita a suo modo meravigliosa vita
5865959 bantuan yang kami terima ndak cukup buat beli bahan baru itupun bertahap
5865960 kalau diberi sekaligus juga mana cukup buat beli bahan apalagi saya terima bertahap bahan bangunan sekarang kan mahal
5865961 saya membawa keluarga bergabung dengan warga lain mengungsi di masjid kampung di sana tinggal berbulan bulan
5865962 awalnya harus punya tanah dulu karena tak punya terpaksa pinjam uang rp 3 juta untuk beli tanah tujuh meter
5865963 dengan uang rp 15 juta mau bangun apa saya jual becak motor untuk nombok beli bahan bangunan itupun tak cukup buat beli bahan bahan baru
5865964 jika kamu ingin bantuan tahap kedua cair saya minta jatah rp 4 juta
5865965 kok nggak kasihan dengan kami pak tek bantuan kami butuhkan karena kami tak punya rumah
5865966 ini uang jatuh dari langit kalau saya tidak dikasih bagian jangan harap proposal bantuan tahap kedua cair saya tidak akan paraf laporan kamu
5865967 daripada uang tidak keluar lebih baik saya kasih itupun setelah saya bikin masalah di kantornya dia mau terima sejumlah rp1 5 juta
5865968 kita korban konflik kan orang yang ndak pernah masuk kantor ndak tahu macam mana lapor sini atau lapor sana
5865969 saya juga mendengar laporan itu pemotongan bantuan malah ada laporan oknum staf bra ikut menikmati bantuan korban
5865970 saya sudah coba telusuri siapa orangnya tapi si pelapor tidak ingat persis siapa oknum itu
5865971 saya belum tahu korban korban mana saja yang belum dapat bantuan rumah atau sudah mendapat mendapat rumah tapi dilaporkan bermasalah oleh masyarakat
5865972 ada seorang penerima bantuan rumah tapi tidak ada bukti membangun rumah malah membeli sejumlah mayam emas saya desak dia mengembalikan uang bantuan
5865973 saya pusing bagaimana cara membaginya kalau 100 rumah tiap tahun maka permohonan bantuan rumah baru bisa terpenuhi semua sekitar tahun 2015
5865974 masyarakat ingin cepat dapat bantuan saya juga ingin cepat menyelesaikan masalah
5865975 kami pasrah saja kalau menolak pemotongan takut tidak diperhatikan aparat desa nanti
5865976 setelah mengambil uang di bank jumlah yang kami bawa pulang tak utuh satu kalipun
5865977 zakaria meminta uang bantuan diyat nanti dibagi dua kok tega dia bertindak begitu padahal saya ini tak punya apa apa lagi
5865978 kalau adik nanti bertemu zakaria jangan sebut sebut nama kami bilang saja dari warga desa kami takut kelak dapat masalah cukuplah konflik membuat kami menderita
5865979 geuchik berdalih potongan itu sebagai uang jerih payah dan pelicin pengurusan dana diyat di tingkat kecamatan
5865980 sebetulnya warga enggan haknya dipotong tapi mereka khawatir geuchik akan mempersulit pengurusan administrasi desa atau bantuan lainnya
5865981 kami bukan memeras korban tapi hanya dikasih uang minum kopi
5865982 ini potongan wajar kami terima sebagai pamrih untuk hasil kerja tim verifikasi
5865983 ini kan berbelit belit bra kabupaten tidak punya wewenang menyalurkan bantuan kami hanya memasukkan data berdasarkan rekomendasi kepala desa lalu serahkan ke provinsi apakah korban sudah terima atau belum itu kami lepas tangan
5865984 penyaluran bantuan itu langsung ditangani unit pelaksanaan program bra pusat di banda aceh kadang mereka tidak lagi mempedomani data korban konflik yang kita berikan kalau begini caranya saya usulkan bra kabupaten dibubarkan saja
5865985 saya agak bingung kenapa harus berurusan dengan dinas sosial di sisi lain kami harus mengacu pada pedoman kerja bra provinsi
5865986 mestinya dibuat sederhana saja cukup dana apbn anggaran pendapatan dan belanja negara ditampung di rekening bra provinsi lalu diteruskan ke bra kabupaten atau kota sebagi penyalur
5865987 tiap rumah berarti di potong rp 10 5 juta ini terjadi pada program tahun 2006
5865988 tarmizi burrahman kholidi amirudin mukminin asri tami muchtarudin kasturi usman suandi budiman nurdin abdurrahim
5865989 ini kubur saili abang sepupu saya ini bapaknya abdullah hadad
5865990 angka ini maksudnya hari sabtu 17 mei 2003 ini penanda waktu mereka dikubur
5865991 saya selamat karena usia saya masih dibawah 16 tahun sampai mati saya akan ingat
5865992 aksi mereka macam serangan fajar datang pagi pagi lantas tak lama pergi
5865993 rumah itu milik pak daud dulu hanya rumah papan dengan satu kamar saja sebelum kejadian pembakaran dia berhasil melarikan diri ke hutan
5865994 siapa yang mau jadi orang gam gerakan aceh merdeka kalau jadi orang gam inilah contohnya akibatnya
5865995 kalau kalian mau selamat jangan liat ke atas ke samping ke kiri ke kanan liat saja ke bawah
5865996 maak ini mayat ayah saya mengenali peci ini ini punya ayah
5865997 saya bersama seluruh warga kampung hanya dikumpulkan di masjid sepertinya tentara sudah membagi tugas
5865998 saya ikut memandikan jasad korban awalnya sih tak tahan tapi bagaimana di sana jambo keupok sudah tidak ada lelaki dewasa sudah lari ke hutan
5865999 setahu saya waktu itu ada 15 orang warga yang menjadi kombatan gam kalau yang lain saya tidak tahu karena soal dukung mendukung gam kembali kepada pilihan masing masing
5866000 saya dilepas tentara setelah magrib dan mendengar warga cerita ada pembakaran penduduk
5866001 kalau waktu konflik dulu tidak jelas mana simpatisan mana kombatan
5866002 tapi kalau 16 orang itu orang gam kenapa mereka tidak lari atau melawan sekalian ketika tentara datang
5866003 kalau saya cerita ke abang terus mau diapakan jangan cuma tanya tanya setelah itu tak ada hasil
5866004 perdamaian hanya ada di tingkat elit rakyat belum menikmati perdamaian selama pelaku pelanggaran ham belum diadili
5866005 menuntaskan kasus kasus pelanggaran ham masa lalu di aceh dengan cara membentuk kkr dan pengadilan ham
5866006 kkr aceh tak berkaitan dan berpedoman pada undang undang kkr yang berlaku pada kkr nasional tapi undang undang pemerintahan aceh
5866007 kami menuntut pemerintahan irwandi serius membentuk kkr kalau tidak jelas terus korban pelanggaran ham tidak punya peluang memperoleh keadilan
5866008 maaf bapak bapak sudah lama menunggu saya baru datang dari bener meriah ada urusan sedikit
5866009 aspirasi pemekaran ala ini merupakan kehendak orangtua kita dulu termasuk ayah saya abubakar bintang ketua pni partai nasional indonesia sejak 1945 mereka berjuang tapi belum sempat diurus karena aceh perang terus mulai belanda sampai gerakan aceh merdeka
5866010 sebagai kepala desa tolong katakan kepada rakyat bapak katakan kepada mereka bahwa rakyat aceh pedalaman yang berkumpul di lima kabupaten menghendaki satu provinsi supaya kita bisa urus rakyat ini kalau ada dukungan yuk kita ramai ramai ke jakarta kita beri dukungan kepada komisi ii dpr ri supaya cepat tandatangani uu pemerintahan ala
5866011 saya usul seluruh kepala desa berkumpul dulu sebelum ke jakarta masih banyak yang belum tahu proses perjuangan ala mereka harus diberi pemahaman dulu
5866012 kami harus meyakinkan bahwa pemekaran ini didukung oleh seluruh rakyat ala
5866013 usulan nama provinsi sudah berkali kali berubah sebelum akhirnya bernama ala awalnya bernama galaksi akronim dari gayo alas kuala simpang singkil kemudian gats dengan akronim yang sama dengan galaksi belakangan kuala simpang atau aceh tamiang batal ikut gabung
5866014 usulan pembentukan provinsi ala sudah lama didiskusikan di era presiden aburrahman wahid dibahas di era megawati soekarno putri dan diharapkan lahir pada awal era presiden susilo bambang yudhoyono
5866015 waktu pertemuan di rumah saya di jakarta pengurus komite sepakat mengendapkan sementara aspirasi pemekaran kita tidak mau ganggu konsentrasi pemerintah terhadap mou dan penanganan aceh pascabencana
5866016 anggota komite kemudian kembali merapatkan barisan setelah kita akan mengawal dpr supaya tetap membahas usulan pemekaran aceh
5866017 apapun cerita selama masih bergabung dalam satu provinsi dengan orang orang pesisir kita yang di pedalaman ini susah jadi pemimpin di banda aceh hubungan kami seperti air dengan minyak
5866018 waktu itu harga barang barang jadi mahal harga bensin sampai di atas rp 10 ribu
5866019 kalau ada lima atau lebih anak tinggal dalam satu rumah perhatian orangtua pasti terbagi orangtua akan bekerja keras agar anak anaknya bisa mendapat nafkah nah bila seorang anak memilih pisah mungkin dia ingin merantau beban orangtua kan setidaknya berkurang si anak juga akan lapang dada bisa mandiri dan tidak menjadi beban orangtua
5866020 mestinya provinsi nad itu seperti taman mini indonesia indah semua suku ditampung pada satu tempat dirangkul birokrasi itu kan setidaknya begitu
5866021 pemekaran itu kan sebuah aspirasi juga dpr harus mendengar keinginan itu
5866022 kesepakatan itu hanya antara gam dengan pemerintah ia bukan perjanjian internasional karena tidak ada persetujuan dpr jadi tidak bisa menjadi acuan hukum untuk mengatur masalah domestik indonesia termasuk aceh
5866023 pemekaran hanya isu elit aroma uang dan kepentingan sangat kental kalau sudah mekar akan ada kepala daerah baru anggota dewan baru dan jabatan birokrasi baru jawaban yang baik adalah mempercepat pemerataan pembangunan di aceh rakyat hanya peduli bagaimana ekonomi bisa baik
5866024 saya lebih baik diam isu pemekaran ini sangat sensitif untuk dikomentari
5866025 sekalian jadi alat sosialisasi kita tempel di rumah rumah kantor kepala desa supaya anak cucu lebih mengenal wilayah ala
5866026 saya yang bikin peta ini selama 1 5 tahun saya keliling aceh memetakan wilayah ala secara digital dengan sistem gps yah meski tidak tiap hari
5866027 selain geografis kelima kabupaten acuan saya adalah etnografi gayo jadi acuan utama di mana ada wilayah yang dihuni mayoritas orang gayo masuk wilayah ala
5866028 suku suku yang tinggal di wilayah ala sama sama minoritas di aceh kami ini juga sama sama hidup di pedalaman dan dataran tinggi
5866029 jadi kalau ditanya siapa suku asli di aceh ini ya kami kami seperti suku aborigin di australia nasib kami terpinggirkan
5866030 setahun irwandi yusuf jadi gubernur aceh kondisi jalan jalan umum masih belum berubah
5866031 tapi coba berapa kali irwandi melihat kondisi pedalaman lebih lebih kami yang di pegunungan ini karena aceh sangat luas makanya kami minta mekar
5866032 tolong tunjukan pada saya mana pasal pasal yang bilang aceh tidak boleh ada pemekaran uu pa itu harus tunduk juga pada undang undang yang lebih tinggi di ri ini kedudukan uu pa itu sejajar dengan undang undang lain misalnya undang undang tentang pemerintahan daerah yang mengatur pemekaran
5866033 ingat ya nad itu belum menjadi sebuah negara merdeka kita ini sedang ber nkri negara kesatuan republik indonesia ketika kami minta pemekaran itu sah dan hak
5866034 lalu kenapa kami yang benar benar ber nkri tidak pernah memberontak tidak boleh minta mandiri
5866035 di sana itu dominasi orang arab india campa kling tamil coba periksa berapa orang gayo di kantor gubernur apa karena kami tidak mampu jadi pemimpin di jawa banyak orang gayo jadi pemimpin maaf ya nenek moyang kami dulu juga jadi pemimpin di pesisir
5866036 kami dulu memberi makan orang orang pesisir ketika perang dengan belanda ketika panglima polim dan cut nyak dien kepepet ke tanah gayo dia berlindung
5866037 aku dulu seniormu di amm kau dulu anak buahku di kabupaten apa yang tertera dalam mou itu saja yang kau pegang jangan banyak komentar
5866038 sampai sekarang bang irwandi tetap telepon kadang saya diminta bertemu ke banda setiap dia tanya kondisi di aceh tengah saya tetap beri masukan
5866039 usulan pemekaran itu tidak masalah itu sifatnya hak demokrasi tapi kita komit dengan mou jadi elit elit yang mengusulkan mekar itu artinya tidak senang dengan mou inilah provokator yang ingin menghancurkan perdamaian di aceh
5866040 soal provinsi gam sendiri sudah ada provinsi saya gubernur gam wilayah linge cuma kantornya belum ada
5866041 kalau proses mou sudah selesai baru kita minta ke elit elit aceh
5866042 kami kan belum bergerak sementara ini diam aja kalau kami orang kpa komite peralihan aceh organisasi mantan anggota gam seluruh aceh berdemontrasi ke banda aceh kan lain cerita
5866043 kalau mereka berkeras agar ala berdiri hilangkan dulu gam di wilayah aceh tengah dan bener meriah ini bunuh dulu kami supaya tidak dianggap melanggar mou tapi karena kami sudah mengikat diri dalam mou mestinya libatkan kamilah
5866044 kalau ala disahkan oleh pemerintah pusat akan terjadi kekacauan kita akan perang lagi lebih kacau perang ini daripada yang kemarin
5866045 saya akan konsultasi dulu ke gubernur nanti saya kasih kabar lagi
5866046 kalau aaf berhasil dijual merekalah investor pertama yang kongkrit berusaha dengan modal besar pascakonflik di aceh
5866047 pemerintah aceh diberi kesempatan memiliki saham 10 persen setelah dua tahun pabrik berjalan
5866048 kalau pabrik ini sedang aktif mungkin kita tidak bisa keluar masuk sebebas ini
5866049 jadi sebelum memperpanjang kontrak gas alam cair ke aaf mereka sudah bikin kontrak ke jepang dan korea dengan kata lain gas dalam tanah itu sudah dijual sampai 2014
5866050 kami berharap pabrik ini secepatnya dihidupkan tak masalah siapapun yang kelola daripada nanti jadi besi tua
5866051 gas di aceh melimpah tapi yang dipakai untuk ekonomi daerah tak seberapa
5866052 sebenarnya dari total produksi gas exxon jumlah gas alam cair yang dipakai untuk bahan baku pupuk hanya empat persen ada tiga pabrik di aceh yang pakai gas ini berarti totalnya 12 persen jadi kecil sekali
5866053 liat saja pabrik pupuk iskandar muda sekarang produksinya 50 persen kondisinya antara hidup dan mati kalau mau jujur secara bisnis pim harus tutup
5866054 letak kami ini kan berdekatan kadang pim sering pinjam alat alat pabrik kepada kami jadi kalau soal informasi kondisi pabrik pasti tahulah
5866055 kenapa tidak ditutup nah di situ ada mainan orang politik
5866056 kalau pemerintah memakai persediaan gas di arun belum tentu exxon mau karena itu artinya pasokan gas untuk pembeli luar negeri akan berkurang mereka sudah meneken kontrak pembelian sampai 2014
5866057 exxon itu tidak mau dengar pihak lain selain pertamina kalau pertamina bilang kasih gas exxon akan kasih tapi dengan catatan berapapun gas yang diberikan kepada siapapun harganya harus sesuai dengan standar internasional
5866058 lantas mengapa aaf tidak menerima tawaran harga gas dari exxon ketika kontrak pembelian tahap pertama habis
5866059 saat negosiasi untuk kontrak kedua pada 2003 exxon meminta harga us 1 5 dollar per mmbtu million metric british thermal unit naik lima dollar dari harga kontrak pertama tapi tanpa ada alasan yang jelas mereka bilang quota gas sudah habis untuk ekspor
5866060 jawaban pemerintah pusat waktu itu berputar putar ini menyakitkan kita sebagai orang daerah
5866061 kadang kami tinggal di kantor perwakilan aceh pernah menyewa satu rumah di bilangan tebet jakarta selatan kalau lagi genting kami menginap di kantor dpr pusat di senayan
5866062 ketika tender penjualan dibuka ada dua peminat serius ingin beli yakni medco energi dan sebuah perusahaan konsorsium dari cina
5866063 saya menduga medco menawar murah karena berharap pasokan gas dari blok a
5866064 di situ terlihat menteri tidak konsekuen mau cari selamat kenapa dia tidak menceritakan kronologis penutupan aaf kepada dpr
5866065 saat itu perlu rp 500 miliar untuk menghidupkan aaf ini dinilai memberatkan keuangan daerah waktu rapat berkali kali dengan pejabat gubernur aceh mustafa abubakar dia bilang saya menyerah aceh tidak sanggup menghidupi aaf
5866066 saya ingin orang orang itu memberitahu irwandi agar mendorong penyelesaian pabrik aaf
5866067 konsorsium cina itu akan menggunakan batu bara sebagai bahan bakar pabrik menggantikan gas alam cair mereka siap merombak beberapa bagian mesin pabrik yang cocok dengan tenaga batu bara
5866068 kalau aaf mau menggantikan sumber bahan bakunya dengan batu bara maka ini yang pertama di asia tenggara rencananya empat tahun lagi pabrik pupuk di vietnam juga menggunakan teknologi serupa
5866069 kenapa tentara yang harus membongkar kenapa bukan aparat pemda pemerintah daerah
5866070 kami curiga ini ada kaitannya dengan upaya tentara untuk berbisnis mestinya lahan itu dikelola pemda bukan tentara
5866071 kami tidak menolak renovasi tapi menolak penggusuran kedai pedagang karena kamilah yang telah berjasa memperbaiki membersihkan lokasi kolam sejak awal
5866072 saya tidak punya aktivitas lain selain berjualan sejak penutupan kedai saya tidak punya penghasilan lain
5866073 kami bertiga termasuk yang pertama membuka kedai di kolam mata ie dulu masih banyak semak belukar kami yang susah payah merapikan batu batu sekitar kolam tentara tentara itu mana ada yang bantu
5866074 kedai kami akan dipindahkan ke kolam bagian atas lokasi yang lama akan dibangun taman bunga di sekitar kolam bawah
5866075 pemindahan kedai ke lokasi atas tidak layak karena sempit untuk meletakkan meja dan kursi
5866076 pembongkaran itu mestinya dilakukan oleh pemda karena saya mengantongi surat izin tempat usaha dari pemda
5866077 penarikan retribusi pedagang dan tiket masuk sudah berjalan sejak rindam berdiri di mata ie awalnya bercap pemda setelah tsunami berubah jadi cap primkopad rindam
5866078 inisiatif awal datang dari primkopad konsepnya bagus kolam bagian bawah akan dibuat taman bunga tempat anak anak bermain kedai kedai akan diseragamkan saya yakin akan makin ramai karena kita akan meng up grade jalan lain ke sana tahun depan
5866079 harus diingat itu tanah pemda surat izin bisa saja dicabut untuk kepentingan yang lebih besar ketiga pemilik kedai itu tidak mau dipindah ke atas karena takut sepi pembeli itu kan mementingkan diri sendiri namanya
5866080 terus terang kami pemda kurang kecenderungannya mengelola mata ie selain dana terbatas pengelolaan oleh pemda akan banyak makan biaya misalnya pengangkatan pegawai masih banyak yang lebih perlu kita biayai
5866081 secara pribadi saya lebih setuju kalau pengelolaan diserahkan kepada pihak ketiga
5866082 tergantung dari mana kita menginterpretasi keinginan dari primkopad kebetulan mereka yang merancang desain renovasi mata ie pemda cuma diberitahu saja
5866083 ini salah satu upaya untuk mensejahterakan anggota kami yang akan dibagi dalam setiap rapat anggota tahunan berupa shu sisa hasil usaha
5866084 sebetulnya ini rencana lama tapi tidak ada respon alhamdulillah setelah saya coba kejar akhirnya tembus
5866085 sebelumnya mereka memanfaatkan parit sebagai tempat mandi ini bahaya buat anak anak apalagi kalau ada air deras
5866086 pembangunannya menghabiskan biaya rp 300 juta yang kita bangun sendiri
5866087 rencana besar ini tidak bisa dihentikan oleh kepentingan pribadi tiga orang kalau mata ie mau maju mestinya mereka mau berkorban lahan mereka terlalu luas untuk tiga orang
5866088 kecuali dia punya sertifikat tanah saya yang salah tapi kalo surat izin usaha apa sih itu suatu saat bisa dicabut untuk kepentingan yang lebih besar begitu bunyi kalimat terakhirnya
5866089 sejak zaman belanda kolam mata ie sudah diserahkan pengelolaanya kepada rindam ini kan tanah negara
5866090 saya jelaskan rindam tidak punya sertifikat pemda pun tidak punya sertifikat tapi dari tahun 1950 an sudah dikelola rindam semuanya digunakan untuk lokasi latihan rindam masjid rindam lapangan tenis rindam kita buka bukaan saja ini tanah negara jadi kami dengan pemda itu sama statusnya sama sama instansi pemerintah dan selama ini sudah rindam pengelolanya
5866091 memang ini sudah daerah kami jadi kalau ibarat rumah mata ie ini seperti halaman pekarangan kalau orang lain yang ngatur halaman kami rasanya tidak enak sekalilah
5866092 pendapatan dari tiket masuk kalau ramai sekitar rp 1 juta kalau hari hari biasa paling rp 100 ribu untuk bayar petugas kebersihan sebenarnya nggak cukup
5866093 nanti mereka harus mengosongkan kedai kalau sudah sore kalau sudah pagi silahkan datang memasukkan barang jangan suka sukanya tinggal di dalam kedai
5866094 kami ini tidak punya indikasi negatiflah apalagi kami ini cuma dinas hari ini di sini besok mungkin sudah pindah
5866095 kata siapa itu siapa yang ngomong saya belum pernah mendengar
5866096 kita targetkan akhir tahun ini selesai nanti kita akan buat peresmian kolam untuk promosi anda jangan lupa datang ya
5866097 alien hominid criado originalmente em flash para navegadores de internet em um cultuado t tulo para consoles
5866098 setelah kalian tarik jaring kalian ikut kami ke teupin layue dan kita selesaikan masalahnya di sana
5866099 kalau begini caranya bapak tahan saja boat dan jaring kami tapi bapak harus beri makan istri dan anak kami
5866100 apa bapak tidak tahu kalau kawasan ini tidak boleh ada aktivitas menjaring
5866101 kalau bapak tetap melarang kami memancing boleh saja tapi bapak harus cari kerjaan lain buat kami atau beri makan keluarga kami
5866102 saya tidak tahu karena saya baru di daerah ini apa tidak bisa diselesaikan di sini saja masalahnya
5866103 nggak bisa pak mereka ini bukan sekali saja tertangkap kalau bapak tidak percaya coba tanya kepada orang ini sudah berapa kali dia tertangkap
5866104 mereka ini juga sudah dinasehati di laut untuk tidak menjaring di wilayah ini lagi dan sudah membuat surat pernyataan

5866110 i have heard the convergence of batman and the joker compared to that between john wayne and lee marvin in john fords the man who shot liberty valance but ford was telling us that people want to believe heroism grows out of reason and law and civilization but that it really doesnt instead it is a throwback to the most primitive honor cultures before there were any law or civilization which are things that cannot be contracted for the dark knight tells us the opposite
5866111 the emphasis on deception in the dark knight is one of the themes that connects it with nolans previous films and batmans climactic act of self sacrifice is precisely an act of deception it takes place at the level of signs what he must give up is his reputation his good standing in the eyes of the gotham public the act of deception doesnt conceal an underlying good act it is the concealing that is the good act itself
5866112 although my appreciation of his rather garlanded joker and of the dark knight in general is not unreserved youre correct to say that the strength of heath ledgers performance consists in his playing the mask what sanctions that however for me is the masks transparency the misapplied make up is not an extension of the rictus as with nicholsons joker rather the mismatched smear points us to the face as do other tell tale signs splodges of pink flesh under the white the rather deep ridges of wrinkles the message is the face is the mask and hence no backstory or which is to say the same thing no locatable history of trauma which again is to say cause

5866129 more than 20 dollars clearly shows that there has been speculation in the market
5866130 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5866131 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5866132 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5866133 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5866134 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back

5866141 rates went too far and the reserve is now trying to reverse them

5866160 if you look at a list of the top 20 global asset managers youre looking at the likely list of winners
5866161 funds with lengthy experience are expert at analysing what their needs are
5866162 as some of the newer funds mature i expect them to continue to look for diversified sources of return and expand in the alternatives space
5866163 renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties to adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5866164 to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5866165 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go states are the ones who build these kinds of understandings the federal government shouldnt meddle in that compact
5866166 i think the senator recognizes that way down the road there may be changes and that states will come together to reconsider the settings at that point but theres no reason on the senators mind to re open the compact or to insert federal interests this is an issue thats been resolved by the states and should stay resolved as it has been by the states
5866167 sen mccain made a major blunder and now gov romney is trying to provide some political cover
5866168 it wont work sen mccain showed his true colors hes a lower basin senator trying to grab up as much upper basin colorado water as possible coloradans wont take kindly to that
5866169 senator mccain said very clearly that he believes the colorado river compact should be opened for renegotiation
5866170 either senator mccain is so out of touch with western water issues that he needs the former massachusetts governor to defend him or he really has some interest in overhauling the law of the river that has been in place since 1922 both scenarios are troubling
5866171 let me make one thing perfectly clear i would never advocate any course of action that would damage the state of colorados rights over the water or any other water resources that is going to be one of the most precious commodities for colorado and the entire west
5866172 i would never support any policy or any federal role that would impair the state of colorado or other states rights to their resources but i know there have been discussions amongst the governors i encourage those discussions as to how we best use a scarcer and scarcer resource in the west
5866173 pcl construction services did a side x ray of the cornerstone using the latest technology and they tell us there was nothing in there
5866174 we rely on technology to tell us whats there and whats not there
5866175 it was in a copper box and contained documents pertaining to the masons membership rosters the home address of the grand mason a 1907 coin minted in denver and an address by mayor robert speer to the people of denver
5866176 even with the evidence of the x ray id still bet the box is in there
5866177 we dont want a big hole in our building with all the dnc conventioneers wholl be coming here
5866178 i think its safe to say we need a lot of convincing that this is the right way to go the research really shows that lowering the drinking age really doesnt do a whole lot to solve the problems we see among college age drinkers
5866179 i think there a lot more consequences when you can drink legally
5866180 absolutely not it gives them a free ticket to go out and drink
5866181 were a little bit skeptical but we are willing to listen to good ideas and have an intelligent debate
5866182 ive done what i think is a great deal of what i can do in this situation let us now either perform or not perform
5866183 they are cuts that we can live with and over two years it will amount to 1 billion so were well on our way to trying to resolve some of these difficulties in our state budget
5866184 i am deeply honoured by the quality that keeps us ahead of other travel publications
5866185 by accelerating our enterprise growth and executing well across the portfolio hp delivered a strong third quarter performance
5866186 our global position broad product and services offerings and incremental cost saving opportunities make us confident that well continue to meaningfully expand earnings
5866187 inikan menggunakan mata uang rupiah tetapi kalau masuknya dari mata uang lain selain dolar tentunya akan menjadi lebih bagus jadi akan memperbanyak portofolio mata uang asing diluar dolar
5866188 the russian troops remain in their positions in and around gori though there are some reports indicating that a small convoy of armored vehicles and tanks left gori for south ossetia earlier tuesday
5866189 the russian general staff indicated that the withdrawal would intensify after friday
5866190 at the same time the russian military stated that georgia has not returned all its troops to their bases
5866191 the un stands ready to facilitate international discussions in this regards and to take part in concrete arrangements for a settlement
5866192 full and immediate compliance with the cease fire agreement to which the parties have subscribed
5866193 immediate withdrawal of russian forces to the lines held prior to the outbreak of hostilities and the return of georgian forces to their usual bases
5866194 the high commissioner will again press for the protection of the civilian population especially those newly displaced and for safe and unhindered access by humanitarian organizations to the areas of displacement
5866195 i hope the international community will show itself fully ready capable and willing to help provide critically needed assistance to the people of georgia
5866196 while the most acute phase of the violence appears to have passed until there is a firm peace in the country we must be prepared to respond to a critical and fluctuating humanitarian situation
5866197 this concludes a successful effort by our division of enforcement to stop fraud in its tracks return as much money as possible to defrauded investors
5866198 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5866199 we are not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months we are going to see a whopper we are going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5866200 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5866201 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5866202 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime they are great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5866203 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5866204 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5866205 theres no doubt we are in a period of stagflation now
5866206 the salafi movement totally rejects this document and who signed it has no right to claim belonging to the salafi movement or representing it
5866207 this document is harmful to the sunni community and would end up in vain god willing those who signed it have no influence and whoever wants to defuse tension should talk to forces that do exist
5866208 saat puasa pasangan suami istri tentu saja tidak diperbolehkan berhubungan seks mulai dari azan subuh sampai azan magrib tiba lepas dari waktu itu mereka boleh berhubungan seks kapan saja
5866209 mereka yang berpuasa lebih sering kehabisan energi ketika akan berhubungan intim makanya mereka pun berusaha keras mengatur waktu sebaik mungkin untuk menyenangkan pasangannya masing masing jika hari hari biasa pasangan suami istri bisa bercinta setiap hari mungkin selama puasa mereka cukup berhubungan intim seminggu sekali
5866210 attracting the best and brightest into the industry is a challenge its not happening
5866211 essentially we took the nobility and the necessity out of it and replaced it with this vague sense of drudgery
5866212 in the last several years all of the benefits of a career in the trades have kind of gotten lost in the clutter of all the other career opportunities
5866213 what the industry needs is to be much more aggressive in marketing and creating visibility
5866214 its not like going to college where you go to school for five to eight years and have to work a part time job
5866215 i chose the path that i wanted to take and learned as much as i could for that one thing
5866216 you go to college to kind of figure out what you want to do but if you dont figure it out you go out with debt and you still dont know
5866217 to the extent that people are picking college theyre turning down construction
5866218 were keeping careful control of the amount of money that comes into the fund because of the low liquidity of the area itself
5866219 weve had meetings and conference calls with institutional investors in most geographic areas
5866220 it continues to be a robust market for asset gathering
5866221 its coming primarily from foundations and endowments many of whom have investments in africa already and are looking to expand them
5866222 are often overlooked and under researched meaning there is potential to find compelling investment opportunities
5866223 like looking for a black cat in a dark room
5866224 we expect a lot more activity in 2008 and 2009
5866225 the fundamental shops are definitely getting the skills they need to compete effectively
5866226 are driven by returns and brands as much as anything
5866227 youre going to find the real long short managers will come into this space finally and hit a home run
5866228 my 14 years at the firm were shaped by a variety of different jobs across various markets but the common ingredient was the opportunity to work with outstanding committed people
5866229 the rare opportunity to work with the outstanding scholars educators students and professionals at harvard was compelling
5866230 lead the development of administrative capacity in new areas that cross school boundaries or traditional administrative units
5866231 he will oversee the financial administrative and human resources functions and administrative components of information technology for the central administration
5866232 brings deep experience with a large complex and global organization a proven track record in managing the functions that will be central to his new role and an outstanding reputation for his collegial and effective leadership style
5866233 you have to step up on the client service do some things you might not do for most of your clients
5866234 that way you dont have to say no later and create some bad will
5866235 thats probably the biggest unique advantage relative to other investor bases
5866236 typically quite large even the smaller ones tend to have significant pools of assets
5866237 most sovereign wealth funds are looking to form long term relationships with their managers
5866238 broad product set thats available to them at different phases of their development cycle
5866239 in terms of winning the business its important to be in front of them and to be sensitive to their demands
5866240 im well on pace to hit five continents this year
5866241 its occurring here but its slow in the uk it has advanced at a much faster pace
5866242 we generally favour having such tools available to add flexibility and liquidity to our investor real estate programmes
5866243 but that market is in its infancy in the us and not yet developed to the point where it has been useful
5866244 weve arranged a number of deals for pension funds and portfolio managers
5866245 but there are scores of people sitting in the sidelines waiting for the market to develop in terms of liquidity
5866246 the real estate derivatives market in the us is young and i fully expect it will develop and become more robust as investors become more comfortable with the capabilities and contracts
5866247 in the us weve had nothing of the sort most of what weve seen has been under the table with no real transparency
5866248 its difficult to make any forecasts but we and cb richard ellis believe this asset class needs and is ready for derivatives to help expand the opportunities that are out there
5866249 ive never seen anything get accepted this quickly by the marketplace its unprecedented
5866250 theres been a lot of talk about performance based fees
5866251 theres no question that assets in these products will increase in the next few years
5866252 if its not a separate asset class why does it need a separate benchmark
5866253 clients are a little more willing to back new managers and the traditional consultants are not as dogmatic about waiting for three year numbers theyre willing to move earlier
5866254 clients are increasingly comfortable with firms that are owned and managed primarily by their employees
5866255 we see a real demand in the market for independent unbiased boutiques investors and clients often view their interests as being much better aligned
5866256 has allowed us to create an investment management organization with minimal non investment related distractions where we can focus on doing what we do best fundamental investment research
5866257 thats been the fastest zero to 60 move ive ever seen
5866258 plan sponsors are becoming more comfortable with relaxing some of the shorting constraints
5866259 but most dont have a long track record so many clients will take their time but the strategies will continue to be attractive
5866260 we did asset liability studies for about 30 corporate plans in 2007
5866261 every one of them considered whether to do ldi and about half are going to move toward implementation
5866262 so yes theres movement but its just a toe in the water so far
5866263 wilshire is not a huge fan of the way ldi has been applied in the industry and the products that have been promoted to address matching assets and liabilities
5866264 theres a tendency to think that ldi is a one size fits all solution
5866265 we didnt expect a huge leap into ldi this year
5866266 the products that are out there dont really solve the funding issue we dont expect that will increase much more than whats out there already
5866267 if the markets dont do well more people will consider freezing and then closing their plans which makes them more likely candidates for ldi
5866268 thats the future we see on the corporate side but those that remain active and open are likely to be equity overweight
5866269 the expected shove from the fasb changes is still pretty far down the road
5866270 many of our clients prefer to build hedge fund programs with active managers skilled at shorting
5866271 employing the still somewhat unproven benefits offered by 130 30
5866272 portable alpha is an attractive concept but there are also a lot of moving pieces to it
5866273 from the plan sponsors point of view you have to take your time with it
5866274 we have talked about portable alpha with a fair number of clients
5866275 its a fair argument to say that the complexity scares people off a little bit although there are some basic portable alpha strategies that people already purchase
5866276 many people own that kind of product maybe they dont think of it as portable alpha but it is
5866277 innovative products are growing strongly as the asset allocation of both institutional and retail clients shifts toward alternative investments
5866278 these investments are attracting assets from risk averse retail investors and from pension funds banks and insurers that need to balance liquid asset with their solvency requirements
5866279 these concerns have not appreciably slowed demand however and asset managers are working to improve their offerings
5866280 theyre examining every asset class every strategy nothing is taboo
5866281 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5866282 i mean with chucky so much of it and david and i talk about this a lot that because hes a puppet theres an aspect of him that feels like hes an animated character so his voice is such an immense part of it as well as what he looks like its almost like recasting homer simpson or something if you could recast it you would want the actor to sound kind of like it but it would feel weird to just be completely different i think
5866283 the commission notes that the south africa route has been characterised by limited competition for some time
5866284 there are only two direct operators qantas and south african airways saa and they operate to separate points in australia sydney and perth respectively such competition as there is between them comes via a code share arrangement
5866285 there has been little pressure on the incumbent carriers to discount air fares significantly either to deal with competition or to attract additional traffic
5866286 we have an ability to run by october 2009 but there are other routes
5866287 nearly two thirds of traffic aus sa is fuelled through a third country
5866288 the final signing of the deal was due to happen in saudi arabi but somalis decided to finalize it here and they will go to saudi arabia for a bigger ceremony and to say prayers for somalia
5866289 this season we want to overcome some frustrations from last season last season we fought each other a lot trying to get on the same page technically and tactically but we just never quiet pulled it off from last spring to this summer and all the way into our preseason camp weve had one goal in mind and that is to all be pulling on the same end of the rope thats not always easy to do in athletics but so far weve been doing it and im predicting well have by far a much better season were deeper at every position were starting at a much more advanced point this season as far as our system of play a lot of our returning players are familiar with our system so we havent had to spend as much time explaining and teaching and drawing things up weve been able to just go after it and i think thats one of the more gratifying things about this camp so far were reasonably healthy and were on track were having a solid preseason camp and hope it translates into some big wins this year
5866290 she is having a sensational camp so far its typical for a freshman to start slow in any sport in the big ten because they just dont know what to expect or how to respond to the schedules in college and the time management pressures i think it really impacts their play brook played a significant role for us last year and i think it helps since her and lauren have to learn to handle the pressure much quicker right now shes almost a veteran and i think shell have a fabulous year brook is an emotional player and an extremely gifted athlete she has a tremendous jump great arm swing and is somebody that can play at an all american level i think if the team has a great year she has a chance for postseason recognition that relies on the team having a solid season shes a dramatically quick and a great athlete
5866291 lauren is the most competitive kid we have on the team right now she takes everything in practice seriously if we tell them to put on shoes she wants to be first you cannot buy that kind of competitiveness and lauren brings that to the program this year she seems to be accepted for her competitiveness by her teammates she speaks her mind on the court this year she has polished the rough edges off enough to where she is a model of competitiveness for the rest of the team
5866292 the fact that we will all be part of the team as opposed to last year where we had part of the team pulling in one direction part of the coaching staff pulling in another and part of the team pulling in no direction i think youll get a much more settled down effort by everybody another thing youll see is we wont make nearly as many unforced errors that was us last year we just kept shooting ourselves in the foot when you have a lot of unforced errors the game and the match progress very quickly because the points get thrown up on the board every time there is a mistake what happens when we play without errors is that we must earn our points and the opponents must earn their points it becomes a much more exciting style of play matches last longer and i think everybody feels much better about the product
5866293 right now leading the way for outside hitters are kyla roehrig and brook dieter the middle hitters right now are going to be lauren gibbemeyer and kelly schmidt kelly has made a lot of strides since last season and was also elected the captain rachel hartmann is clearly winning the setter battle a lot of people thought alex blatt would come in and win that spot but rachel has improved very much in the opposite position pam luiz from brazil is in the lead libero is a close battle between jessica granquist and the returning incumbent christine tan i really like how practice is going there is a lot of competition for spots by the time we roll into omaha on the 29th of august i think well be ready
5866294 we made the ncaa tournament and that in itself is not easy feat but it was not one of our better teams we played a tough senior laden team in sacramento state we started competitive but firmly grasped a hold of the idea that things werent going well and we managed to lose that match it was a very frustrating period of time for us in my 12 or 13 years here no team has ever felt that level of frustration in spring practice you could tell that was still on our players minds my view is that the deeper the scar the greater the height you can rise to and i think they are all buying into it
5866295 i think the first tournament that we play in may be one of the toughest of the season we face texas a amp m who is a team that was snubbed out of the ncaa tournament last year and is not happy about it creighton is picked by many to win their conference and theyll be awfully good with lsu some people are picking them to upset florida and win the conference this year i wouldnt be surprised if all those teams will be in the top 25 the tournament in hawaii is tough because they draw between eight and ten thousand people and its difficult to avoid jet lag hawaii will be ranked in the top 12 or so cincinnati has their best team ever so that makes the first two tournaments pretty tough the truly toughest tournament will be when we come home for the diet coke classic cal will be in the top five cal poly will be top eight and notre dame could be in the top 25 were testing ourselves early and its a do or die situation well have to come out of there with some wins
5866296 panama city officials began their persecution of joe francis with open deception continued with perjury and concluded with illegal imprisonment
5866297 that may be what counts for justice in panama city but its not american justice
5866298 follow ing with the eye while resting on a summer afternoon a mountain range on the horizon
5866299 emancipa tion of the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual
5866300 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5866301 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5866302 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
5866303 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
5866304 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis
5866305 senator mccain its time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat
5866306 out of an abundance of respect for both parties we will not allow attack ads of either persuasion to be prominently displayed in our concourses our customers and employees complained and we responded we will not be a party to petty political attacks on either side
5866307 nuclear weapons are scary and thats why we need to pay attention to them
5866308 but to say that the billboard is anti mccain is ludicrous in fact both mccain and obama largely agree with us that we need to rid the world of nuclear weapons these are not attack ads they are a strong reminder to both candidates that this is a very serious issue they need to address northwest airlines is trying to censor free speech and i dont think thats their role
5866309 the cold war ended nearly 20 years ago but the united states and russia still have many thousands of nuclear weapons and each keeps more than a thousand on hair trigger alert ready to be launched within a matter of minutes
5866310 this creates a real risk of an accidental or unauthorized russian launch against one or more american cities we need a public debate about u s nuclear weapons policy and thats why we launched our media campaign
5866311 toward true security ten steps the next president should take to transform u s nuclear weapons policy
5866312 ya va tarde no se ten a que haber esperado a que se cometiesen casos de abusos

5866314 the caviar collagen facial at the mandarin spa will ensure guests leave feeling like a hollywood superstar on the red carpet
5866315 caviar spa treatments are a true phenomenon and are the treatment of choice for those who want incredible skin at this years oscars celebrities indulged in caviar beauty treatments to ensure their skin was glowing when they graced the red carpet
5866316 bueno por algo me mato trabajando no para tener todas estas cosas bonitas
5866317 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5866318 the key terms of the contract allowed the plaintiffs to renew their season tickets with cost certainty and maintain their priority seat numbers these terms are enforceable despite the sonics relocation to oklahoma city based on the foregoing the court should deny defendants motion for summary judgment and enter summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs
5866319 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5866320 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5866321 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5866322 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5866323 well just try to match up the best way we can
5866324 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5866325 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5866326 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5866327 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5866328 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5866329 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5866330 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done
5866331 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5866332 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5866333 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5866334 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5866335 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5866336 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5866337 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5866338 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5866339 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5866340 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5866341 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5866342 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5866343 obviously well evaluate him every day he gets in here and see how his knee is holding up
5866344 theres still internal discussions about what were going to do and i should have something for you before we go to baltimore
5866345 we have to wait and see how some things come out and then ill give it to you on thursday
5866346 it feels a lot better than it has which is a good sign its coming out good the more i play catch the better it feels
5866347 the globe insider subscription program has retired and much of the content that required paid access has become free to all globeandmail com visitors every globe columnist daily horoscopes crosswords sudoku puzzles and a suite of news tracking tools are now free margaret wente christie blatchford jeffrey simpson and the rest of the globes best known columnists can join the fray and add their talented voices to the freewheeling conversations of the internet era
5866348 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5866349 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5866350 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5866351 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5866352 oh vicky youre so fine youre so fine you blow my mind hey vicky
5866353 its almost like microsofts state of the union address in regulatory form complete with a standard opening line about innovation
5866354 a lot of people dont realize that we have some very serious problems here keepin this thing going and getting it started i remember when we opened if anybody recalls we didnt have enough money to finish the landscaping and i had bill evans go out and put latin tags on all the weeds
5866355 disneyland is a work of love we didnt go into disneyland just with the idea of making money
5866356 this morning i made the decision to focus all of my professional business social networking contacts to be on facebook
5866357 buy cheap tables and expensive chairs tables are a complete rip off we buy stainless steel restaurant tables that are 100 and 600 chairs total cost per workstation 700 compare that to buying a 500 1 500 cube designer workstation the chair is the only thing that matters invest in it
5866358 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
5866359 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
5866360 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
5866361 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
5866362 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
5866363 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals
5866364 junior doctors are the people in hospitals most likely to prescribe medication and they are also the most likely to make errors in prescribing
5866365 we found that in all their training junior doctors learn about diseases and symptoms and what drugs to prescribe but they werent really taught about how to tailor those to individual patients such as dosage and frequency and this is where most errors occur
5866366 it really was a case of the pen being mightier than the scalpel
5866367 we dont let junior doctors operate on patients by themselves but we were letting them prescribe medication without proper training
5866368 we developed a safe prescribing training program that has been part of the training for all final year medical students at uq since 2006
5866369 parts of our program have also been adopted by the national prescribing service
5866370 we also developed a standardised medication chart that has been adopted by queensland health and implemented across all of its 108 facilities across the state as well as being rolled out nationally

5866385 als kamerbreed of bijna kamerbreed het idee ontstaat dat dit met de retourtjes voor de reiziger slecht uitpakt dan zie ik het niet gebeuren
5866386 deze chipkaart zou het reisgemak verbeteren en wat we nu zien is dat de techniek de mogelijkheden alleen maar beperkt
5866387 ik kan niet meer anoniem met korting reizen ik ga extra betalen omdat het retourtje verdwijnt en als ik een beetje pech heb word ik nog geplet tussen de poortjes ook
5866388 de vervoerders worden misschien nog beter van deze chipkaart maar de reiziger allang niet meer willen we van de ov chipkaart echt een succes maken dan moet de staatssecretaris er voor zorgen dat de reiziger ook echt beter af is dus altijd gegarandeerd de laagste tarieven
5866389 dit voorstel voldoet niet aan onze belangrijkste eis namelijk dat reizen door de ov chip niet duurder mag worden en dat wordt t nu wel voor een belangrijk deel van de reizigers

5866411 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
5866412 i was a bit hesitant because i didnt know how it could help us
5866413 but i dont think it is cheating after having done it twice it just helps you find information to answer the question appropriately
5866414 it was good to have someone else to talk to and brainstorm some ideas with
5866415 i phoned my aunty who is pretty good at english i asked her about the olympic games and whether it was a waste of finances she gave me the idea that they use the money for infrastructure instead of for chinas people i expanded on that idea
5866416 they werent marked on their information about the olympic games but on whether they used persuasive language effectively to make their argument
5866417 what if we allowed the use of mobile phones and instant messaging to collect information during exams redefining such activity from cheating to using our tools and including the world in our knowledge base

5866508 we look at it as an opportunity to get better to learn from james
5866509 he said i swear if one more little kid comes up to me and says james can i get your autograph
5866510 when you have such a great linebacker like james its tough to be in that spotlight but at the same time you get an opportunity that a lot of people want to see him play and youre able to showcase your talent

5866543 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview and its important to know what they are
5866544 i believe this because of a christian muslim morman hindu wikkan scientologist revelation
5866545 what i trace this to is a certain selfishness on my part i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people and the process for me of growing up was to recognize that its not about me
5866546 we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5866547 this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of these

5866641 when asked to imagine their own relatives being gravely ill or injured nearly 20 percent of doctors and other medical workers said god could reverse a hopeless outcome
5866642 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship with patients and their families according to researchers that trust they said is needed to help doctors explain objective overwhelming scientific evidence showing that continued treatment would be worthless

5866675 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5866676 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5866677 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5866678 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5866679 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5866680 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5866681 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5866682 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5866683 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5866684 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5866685 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5866686 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5866687 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5866688 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5866689 i have a daughter about her age let me help

5866700 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal

5866714 he felt like it was his time to go back
5866715 he was determined he made a real good effort at what he was doing
5866716 he takes the military very seriously he was the type of person who believed in doing the right thing
5866717 thats the worst part hale was so young he was too young his life was just barely beginning

5866720 the slapdash release of morrissey live at the hollywood bowl is done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever and is in breach of their terms as laid out by themselves in an agreement made for the film between warner and my ex manager being warner predictably the sleeve art is appalling it is the work of cash hounds and i urge people not to buy it i am not signed to warner and no royalties from this dvd will come to me please spend your money elsewhere
5866721 it is understood that warner music in london are releasing a smiths greatest hits album in the final quarter of 2008 this release is without morrisseys approval or involvement

5866789 the eu has started applying duties to certain of these products simply because they incorporate certain features or technologies for example to virtually all lcd computer monitors on the market simply because they connect to a computer using a digital video interface dvi to set top boxes that can access the internet eg cable boxes simply because they have a hard drive and to virtually all multifunction computer peripherals simply because the devices are able to copy more than 12 pages per minute
5866790 ita negotiators recognized that ita products would likely develop new features and that technology would improve over time if ita signatories were allowed to deny duty free treatment to ita products simply because they have become more technologically sophisticated virtually no products would be eligible for duty free treatment

5866834 give us a simple answer on how to guide such children away from the gates of hell
5866835 why do you have such a concern for honoring life at conception but little hesitancy to send young soldiers to die in a war based on false premises
5866836 if all of human life is so precious to you why does our government led by your party fail to even count iraqi deaths in the current war
5866837 how much are we willing to really think through the issues
5866838 are we willing to grapple with the big questions or will we once again opt out for the simple answers that help us feel that life is not so hard after all
5866839 the dissolution of the soviet union is the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century
5866840 the reason was for national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
5866841 its really difficult to get a rough society onto a cultivated plane where people are considerate to one another it will take more time to develop and mature culturally as a people i will not see it maybe you will live long enough to see it i wish you well
5866842 we know mobile content whether its wallpaper from a historical rock the vote campaign or a ringtone from a supporting artist encourages todays youth to engage in the political process and show their support for the upcoming election
5866843 mobile content becomes a way of expressing yourself wherever you go
5866844 pushed the envelope of what is possible in mobile application
5866845 wmobile 1 8 illustrates a leap forward in the usability of mobile web applications
5866846 by offering a parity in user experience across all major phone operating systems we are enabling our customers to freely choose the mobile phone device most suitable for their users without concern for model and operating system obsolescence
5866847 with wmobile we have been able to fulfill a need for our small to mid size customers to mobilize their crm processes the product sales cycle is very short because wmobile is inexpensive and provides great value and implementation is quick and easy i use wmobile to access my goldmine daily so its a pleasure to endorse and sell a product that i really believe in
5866848 we are very hopeful that we will see the first mobile millionaire very shortly
5866849 the market is ripe and now is the perfect time to usher in a new benchmark for mobile gaming to this end we have decided to top up an operator to 1 million should their player win the major millions jackpot before the progressive ticker hits the million mark
5866850 mobile is emerging as a core part of the bebo experience
5866851 by driving availability and adding compelling and unique mobile experiences we hope to make using bebo mobile as natural for our global user base as connecting on a personal computer we will ensure that our members can connect and enjoy the content media and community bebo has to offer in a mobile relevant way
5866852 the operators are failing to address the fact that market is changing at fundamental level
5866853 they should be pursuing a strategy of enablement instead you have situations like the one where nokia launched the n95 in the uk and vodafone removed its voip capabilities claiming they could help terrorists limiting consumers choices and fighting technological progress has yet to work out well for anyone in the long term
5866854 we are 100 people and the opportunity cost of cultivating those relationships is just too high
5866855 we did it when we started out and i could not have been less impressed theres a very long pitch process and then you find the people you were pitching to have moved on and you have to start all over again
5866856 vodafone uk is focused on ensuring that our customers get the best customer service experience possible on the high street
5866857 to deliver this we need to make sure that our customers and potential customers can speak face to face with a retail advisor at a town near them this multi million pound investment will bring our total number of stores to 400 and ensure we can not only meet but surpass our customers expectations
5866858 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5866859 even though there is the suggestion that subscribers would be able to lift the block for a high proportion this would be too disruptive and operators would never maximise their average revenue per user arpu
5866860 in this way they can not only control subscribers mobile broadband usage in the uk and abroad but also the type of content that is being delivered over their network to the user in terms of blocking spam and viruses and in the case of vulnerable users inappropriate or intimidating messages and imagery
5866861 they should also make steps to better protect roaming users from unnecessary data usage such as application and operating system updates which can be upto 500mb in size and in many cases are downloaded without user knowledge
5866862 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

5866930 this recasts our entire development assistance relationship with these countries on one core principle mutual responsibility
5866931 there has been speculation that the tournament might be rescheduled and we understand in a technical sense that while it would be very very difficult to do that it would still be possible
5866932 thats one of the issues that wed be interested to hear their views on after they have their meeting today
5866933 weve got a great deal of sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the people over there but it is our job to advise our players over issues of safety
5866934 we just dont believe its acceptably safe for them to be going to pakistan for the champions trophy which is really disappointing because the players really want to play in the event but its just not safe from our perspective to be there at the moment
5866935 when we had the ball i thought we played very well
5866936 defensively we gave some chances away i was not so pleased with that but thats normal we had a one day preparation
5866937 so football wise we did very well defensively we have to improve but thats what games like this are for
5866938 but overall i was very pleased with the performance the boys looked fresh sharp
5866939 the boys look fresh its the start of the season of course
5866940 they are at the start end of the preparation and they look much fresher than they did in june
5866941 okay the circumstances were great tonight and im looking forward to going to a training camp in holland to play the netherlands and im 100 per cent sure well be ready when we play uzbekistan away
5866942 i look forward to our training camp and then our match against uzbekistan which is when it all begins
5866943 this was a good chance a good opportunity to look at all the players for me
5866944 scott has good experience and has a good feel for space
5866945 he is also very comfotable on the ball im happy he could play 45 minutes and in september hell be ready for 90 minutes
5866946 every player wants to play in the world cup but first we have to concentrate on the qualifying games and scott wants to be there
5866947 we have 11 spots up for grabs we have three weeks to go and anything can happen
5866948 i will wait until our training camp and then make up my mind but i know who is capable of what and have some ideas
5866949 the witnesses may be mistaken but we have to treat any of these reports with the utmost seriousness
5866950 well continue to try and seek some assistance from the community and also conduct patrols in order to identify these kids or just get a little bit more information to ensure that no one is at risk down there
5866951 at this stage until we can confirm either way the contractors have been contacted by police and weve got to try and secure a bit more information again before they start their activities as usual business
5866952 the prime importance is to identify if there is an issue down there and to get the kids some help if there is
5866953 these kids were also asked if they owned any of the bedding and if they were sleeping in the bin and they all said no
5866954 its not the end of the investigation we want to identify these kids so we can contact their parents and explain to them what a dangerous practice it is to play in a skip bin because if someone does fall asleep and the bin gets emptied the ramifications can be horrendous
5866955 the department of community services is working with the police to try and find these children
5866956 until these children are found thats when the department of community services will come into action to work with the children and the family but most importantly we need to find who these children are
5866957 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5866958 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5866959 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the coast could be comparable to coal
5866960 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5866961 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5866962 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field
5866963 its a sign that the government understands that everything isnt good that things need to be fixed and business as usual isnt going to work
5866964 what were hoping is that theyll listen to the arguments that were putting theyll listen to the arguments of other agencies and understand that theyre going to need to put into place an arrangement to fund these agencies for the work theyre expected to do
5866965 we are committed to efficiency we are saying we are committed to having high quality productive work places
5866966 but that doesnt get delivered on the smell of an oily rag that doesnt get delivered when year on year you reduce the budgets of these agencies
5866967 the submissions suggest that many of the cultural agencies have been impacted by the efficiency dividend
5866968 they have suggested that cuts they have made to their activities do not sit well with their mandate to grow and develop their collections
5866969 the point about a code white is to say unless we take these actions there will be problems
5866970 but theyve taken the action and that means problems were averted so its really a management tool to make sure patient safety wasnt compromised and it wasnt in this case as i understand it
5866971 the winter strategy is in fact working and its demonstrated by this particular episode when the hospital was filled up strategies were put into place to make sure there was more capacity that worked very well
5866972 there are corridors of empty rooms and so its a nonsense to say there isnt available beds
5866973 i can understand the criticism that when the surcharge was introduced it wasnt indexed and there is a real concern about that
5866974 i think thats one of the things that ought to be the subject of discussion and negotiation
5866975 its a question of getting the balancing act right between the public and private health mix
5866976 what im saying is its one of those things that ought to be considered
5866977 its something that i need to sit down and talk to the government about the private health sector the opposition
5866978 i want to see what the impact would be of such a measure on the private health funds and the way it impacts on the public system thats the key to me

5866992 if mothers could learn to do for themselves what they do for their children we should have happier households let the mother go out to play if she would only have courage to let everything go when life becomes too tense and just take a day or half a day out in the fields or with a favorite book or in a picture gallery looking long and well at just two or three pictures or in bed without the children life would go on far more happily for both children and parents

5867016 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in
5867017 the lifestyles of working professionals stay at home parents and even secondary and tertiary students is such that when they get in their car they have a tendency to go into auto pilot leaving them free to focus on everything else that is happening in their lives when they should be thinking about their driving
5867018 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5867019 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better

5867031 since the foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza
5867032 your claim that the residents of the gaza strip are suffering from hunger is groundless
5867033 only 43 5 of basic commercial food import needs were met during the period between 3 and 30 december 2007
5867034 the stranglehold on gazas borders has made the work of the un and other humanitarian agencies virtually impossible only a trickle of medicine food fuel and other goods is being allowed in the israeli blockade of gaza has made people highly dependent on food aid and brought the health system and basic services such as water and sanitation near to collapse

5867040 theres a learning curve that has to take place with new owners about the historic use of the lands while also respecting that these are private properties
5867041 in every single town from sausalito to novato these historical uses exist many people consider them to be public but all it takes is a change of owner to make an abrupt change depending on the attitude of the property owner
5867042 if that was necessary there was a very well documented history of use on this trail
5867043 it makes sense to reach out to mr hetfield and encourage him to meet with us and see if we can find a solution that will work for him and the community

5867053 my determination is intact france is determined to continue the struggle against
5867054 we know them we work with them on various occasions away from their purely military activities so of course it touches us very closely theyre really part of our life
5867055 reckless and dangerous policy that has bogged france down in afghanistan
5867056 at that point the georgian leadership told some of us we have no choice but to defend our villages and our people and lift the cease fire our message remained the same that we understand the predicament you face
5867057 but we strongly recommend that you not engage in a direct military conflict with russia because that is unwinnable
5867058 were not trying to issue vague empty threats or wag our finger but simply stating the fact that this military operation has imposed a serious cost on russia in terms of its standing in the world
5867059 thats not as good thing its not something that we relish its not something that we want to see happen
5867060 at least let me open the door for a lady
5867061 we are delighted to enter this global alliance with bristol myers squibb said mark mccamish pdls chief medical officer in a prepared statement
5867062 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work

5867064 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5867065 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5867066 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5867067 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5867068 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5867069 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5867070 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5867071 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5867072 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5867073 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5867074 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5867075 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5867076 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5867077 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5867078 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5867079 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5867080 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5867081 this is the olympic games i didnt even consider it as an option
5867082 the target was within my reach i was in good shape in fact i was in better shape than what i was in athens where she jumped 6 83 her best so far for the sixth place the conditions were very good it is very disappointing to finish like this

5867086 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5867087 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5867088 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5867089 it is likely that it will be difficult to reach a solution in the first meeting it may be reached in the second third or fourth meeting but opposition parties should continue with the dialogue
5867090 she should sit for a discussion with the government make her presentation and the government will try to solve the problem

5867093 similar cases of land return were filed in the supreme court from states like maharashtra and kerala the cases were dismissed
5867094 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistamines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistamines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
5867095 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
5867096 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5867097 a police officer of seven years on medical leave labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and mr dyer uncovered this creature
5867098 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
5867099 the ice was being thawed slowly without aid to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse we estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1 500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely
5867100 the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
5867101 we began an expedited melting process within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5867102 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5867103 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume

5867106 price of two and three wheeler tyres for the replacement market has also been increased by 14 even then many a products have to be sold below the production cost

5867111 you dont get in mccains face and say dont do it
5867112 its an interesting situation everybody would be proud to serve as vice president but at the end of the day publicly you echo the presidents position and i think everybodys vice president understands that thats the rule
5867113 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition
5867114 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5867115 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry
5867116 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights

5867174 it is a trustworthy statement for if we died with him we shall also live with him if we endure we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us if we are faithless he remains faithful for he cannot deny himself

5867211 we can develop a negative perspective of things but tell ourselves that we are just being careful guarded

5867225 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5867226 this is an exciting new approach to geothermal that could meet thousands of times us energy needs
5867227 its 24 7 its potentially developable all over the country and for all that we really do think it could be the killer app of the energy world
5867228 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers
5867229 e on does have investment in renewables and they are pushing forward this scheme we want them to go down this road and use that expertise and technology and stop cancelling it out by pushing forward a coal fired power station
5867230 gives him a pain right there points to his chest
5867231 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5867232 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5867233 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5867234 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5867235 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5867236 we will take some new measures to ensure that air quality will reach a new level after the olympic games
5867237 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
5867238 this proposal is not a sound bite driven band aid

5867245 jurors may well be reluctant to second guess someone whos in that type of situation
5867246 they put themselves in a situation where they or themselves or their families are threatened and it is necessary to respond with deadly force then to say you used too much its very difficult for them to say gee i dont know if i were in that situation if i would have been able to have stopped
5867247 if you reasonably believe that the person you want to use the gun on presents an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to you or your family and you reasonably believe its necessary to use deadly force to stop them
5867248 we are asking for public assistance to locate the three children thought to have been sleeping in the dumpster at maitland
5867249 after 11am on monday police attended a local store in maitland cbd where staff had discovered a mattress blankets and pillows in an industrial bin
5867250 the store employees said the youngsters were poorly dressed and had been seen in the area over the past two weeks
5867251 the four year old boy is described as having a shaved head the six year old boy sported a mullet style haircut and we have no description of the girl
5867252 the report that three children may have been living in a bin has prompted serious concern from local retailers docs and police
5867253 although we cannot confirm that the children were living in the bin concerns remain that they were reportedly in the area on school days were not dressed for winter weather and were without any adult supervision
5867254 the situation came to light when one of our people threw a cardboard box into the bin and a little voice cried out
5867255 then a child jumped out and asked can you give us something

5867258 it didnt go as well as we would have liked
5867259 mr terenzini took our petition and listened to what we had to say
5867260 but he thought the 900 people who signed it were confused and didnt understand the issue properly
5867261 we didnt succeed in changing his mind about his support for the labor party caucus vote to privatise the electricity industry either
5867262 he gave us to understand that health and roads were the priorities of people who contacted him and these were thus his priorities
5867263 the petition wording was that we were selling off assets and privatising the electricity industry
5867264 i told them i was concerned about the wording because it was telling people things that didnt exist
5867265 i was surprised because most of the time we were really relaxed and we were having a good time but it felt good to win
5867266 we got to do things we normally wouldnt get to do and im looking forward to doing engineering

5867271 se est n detectando especies provenientes del mar rojo y que ya llegan hasta el canal de sicilia
5867272 algunas especies como el pez trompeta ya se han localizado entre t nez y sicilia
5867273 si las especies llegan a un punto determinado y consiguen reproducirse se puede decir que han logrado penetrar en el ecosistema con xito
5867274 hay moluscos peces como el pez le n y equinodermos como las estrellas de mar que est n desplazando o cohabitando con especies aut ctonas
5867275 las temperaturas medias est n aumentando y las especies que antes no se sent an c modas est n encontrando nuevos espacios que colonizar

5867292 but candidates are normal people they have household budgets and they feel the price rises like everybody else does
5867293 the worst thing is we get no election funding unlike state and federal candidates who get an amount back
5867294 its all about local issues and number one is infrastructure
5867295 i was eight but i do remember it it was kind of something that i didnt believe
5867296 ever since her mother died ive asked how i can stop it happening to other people and to teach people that taking drugs has consequences on other people as well
5867297 i love horses and i have a passion for drug awareness and this was a way to marry the two
5867298 the message i give to kids is that there are ways to have a natural high without drugs
5867299 we have got in maitland one of the most progressive councils i have seen in my life
5867300 the council needs to be congratulated theyre working as a team theyre not bogged down not losing the way forward
5867301 if we wait until everything is right well never move forwards just go backwards at a greater rate
5867302 rutherford is not the end of maitlands expansion it could end in singleton
5867303 weve seen progress in the western end and the eastern end and one day well get the two to meet
5867304 the council needs to relax their thinking towards heritage listing
5867305 we need to make it work not more of the same
5867306 spending was diverted for all those years and we suffer the effect of having a safe political outlook
5867307 pressure has to be increased until people wont put up with it any longer
5867308 your task in this contest is to show potential developments that might occur in the music industry in the far future
5867309 the question is whether the big goofball can actually take the mound
5867310 gm brian cashman has been a bottom feeder over the past months trying to create as many options as possible that is how sidney ponson ended up in the rotation and that is why he signed eric milton and zambrano to try and revive their careers in the yankee system now wouldnt it be amazing if zambrano a blight on met history could help the yanks at this desperate moment
5867311 this decision is going to be based on who we feel at this point gives us the best chance to win

5867361 dancap has failed to meet the test for an interlocutory injunction
5867362 it seems to me that dancap seeks to obtain the rights to control the sale of the theatres through this motion
5867363 it did not negotiate for this right in the term sheet
5867364 our position was validated by the judge and he seems to have accepted all of our arguments
5867365 he says that key brand has the right to sell and that we have a binding agreement to purchase
5867366 id like to spend my time in the theatres not in the courts
5867367 at the core of all of this is what it means to be a public broadcaster

5867369 so cbc is greatly compressing that kind of music which you could call serious music into a listening ghetto of 10 a m to 3 p m
5867370 i say ghetto just because they know anybody who looks at the numbers knows that the available audience between 10 and 3 is very small compared with mornings or evenings or the drive home or drive to work period

5867376 you want to have the grass trimmed and mowed you want to have the scrubs and trees trimmed nicely people typically drive by a home before they contact a realtor to get in and tour the home
5867377 people just want to buy a home and move in it needs to be move in condition when we have our buyers come through

5867382 once again those numbers only reflect those who came in and said i have a problem with addiction to prescription medication
5867383 that doesnt include those who actually have an addiction to prescription medication and wont say that they have it
5867384 its a little shocking to see folks using medication in this way comments jim harrington of marquette county health department
5867385 it really comes down to having parents and the community involved to recognize that its an issue and that we can reduce access to these products
5867386 the things that have gone on in the past few months have been hurtful counter productive and self serving
5867387 the whole time the gladstone board has never taken the low road and gone out and told our side of the story i would definitely like to see a contract settled so we can start the school year with everybody on a new page and a clean slate
5867388 they took great offense to the way it was presented
5867389 they feel we didnt come across in a negative format just an informative one and we were just trying to provide the public with the information as we had it
5867390 the new contract which will deal with the eri but that eri is also based on losing a contract claim that dealt with sick leave buyout and some other retirement incentives that were bound into it
5867391 it sends a clear message to the community that were back together were going ahead move forward and get back to education

5867395 my boyfriends two roommates actually went away on the same weekend so i stayed over and we had the whole place to ourselves
5867396 i have signed jessicas law petition i dont think its near harsh enough i dont care about putting them in prison but i want them off the streets for the rest of their lives because they are never going to lose that hardwired whatever it is that compels them to do that
5867397 i really like the reception you people threw me you even have someone dressed as fat albert
5867398 and when you have something really nasty to say just do this
5867399 how do you get the maple syrup out of here
5867400 you listen here royals if we dont make the playoffs ill eat this bat
5867401 hey this isnt a silver slugger award its a chocolate bat wrapped in foil awesome
5867402 we now have a much better idea how mccain and obama look at life than we do about stephen harper or stephane dion i know we dont want to be like the yanks but how smart is that
5867403 make sure the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly and not to weigh in for or against any particular candidate
5867404 sometimes there is consensus but certainly that is not a requirement
5867405 failed to address any of the real allegations about the violations
5867406 defend herself by saying she did not vote well we never said she did and her issue that consensus is not required is true in the last few years but we are told the council used operate only on consensus but since the secrecy around this is so deep how do we find out except by an investigation
5867407 jenova chen has been playing video games for 20 years and hes desperate to see something new right now he says most games focus on stimulating players by inciting aggression
5867408 i want to expand what a video game can be
5867409 what they are hearing from the cardinals behind the scenes
5867410 we believe that everyone can rise from circumstances we also believe we owe something to each others as americans
5867411 i think the time and the man have met mccain has the experience and character and hes right on the issues
5867412 its not about color its not about race its about coming together as a city and making anniston the model city it once was and will soon be again
5867413 several years ago the chamber opened the doors to us but you know small businesses suffer financially and at the time i was not able to join
5867414 one is that they come in and meet with me and second is that they attend a function within the first 90 days because the chamber like many organizations is one where the more you put in the more you get out
5867415 this was a pre planned visit for taking part in the tripartite commission involving the coalition pakistan and afghanistan
5867416 swimming arts and crafts and i was planning to do archery this year
5867417 i was at girl scout camps when i was young and the camp experience is unbelievable
5867418 so thats part of the joy of participating as an adult
5867419 im a financial analyst at ibm in essex and thats what i do 51 weeks of the year
5867420 a lot of them come to us from the migrant worker education program and their lives are tough
5867421 this is a chance to give them a week of pure joy and thats why we do it
5867422 its so rejuvenating these kids just bring you to life
5867423 no matter how important your full time job is or isnt theres nothing more rewarding than giving this experience to a group of young kids
5867424 it makes you feel good about yourself at the end of the week
5867425 its odd but anybody who does this will feel completely wiped out and drained at the end of the week but you also have a sense of feeling uplifted because were working with kids showing them things theyve never seen before
5867426 because youve got people with so many different backgrounds they work well together to come up with ideas that might not be the most traditional camp structure but it really works to make it interesting
5867427 were in fear we wont break even and would finish in a deficit if we are not able to raise prices
5867428 yeah im getting a lot of calls so i think its going to be a common situation
5867429 prices are going up faster than schools are able to cope with
5867430 almost every school i have spoken to is in the same position and as far as i know will raise prices
5867431 for some of these kids its the only meal and the only good meal that they get in a day
5867432 there are people falling in the cracks and we are worried for those people
5867433 it will make a difference with me in terms of how often i make lunch and send her to school with a homemade lunch school lunches are not a bad value normally but with prices going up i will probably do it less
5867434 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5867435 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5867436 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5867437 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5867438 the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5867439 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5867440 its not everyday that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realise that russia means business

5867575 weve had a really good two months of footy but were playing against a team that is pretty much undefeated for the last 18 months
5867576 to say were going to go down and beat them is a pretty big ask but well have a crack
5867577 everyones looking for someone to bob up and challenge geelong
5867578 i hope its us but to be honest theyre probably a cut above most teams at the moment
5867579 hawthorn and the bulldogs have probably had a different agenda the last couple of weeks and you can understand that theyll no doubt pick it up before the finals
5867580 wed like to think were in the mix with those two weve beaten them the hawks and bulldogs this year so the difference this year is that weve probably beaten different teams above us as well as below us
5867581 theyre not unbeatable dont get me wrong were going to go down with plenty of confidence the teams up at the moment so im not going to come here and say were going to lose but im not going to come here and say were going to go out there and smash them and take home the points
5867582 media player toque a lista de execu o com um instrumental suave

5867584 and you can see the expression on his face he knows it himself he was pretty animated over that
5867585 people are going to say he missed another goal but thats unfair because he was the reason they were in front for a start and it shouldnt detract from his performance
5867586 he was just outstanding and we didnt really have anyone to go with him
5867587 he was right on the boundary and he hit the post and theyre critical over that one the criticism was not warranted there
5867588 yep theres a big reason why hes in that situation all the time and dont ever lose sight of that
5867589 hed be the first to say yes he should have kicked it but i reckon there was another 70 or 80 incidents where his team could have done something better in that game to give them a bigger lead but its left to him to not only get them in front but also to seal the deal so until they get more players like pavlich theyre going to be where they are
5867590 richo matthew richardson went through that for years tony lockett at st kilda gary ablett at geelong theyre a victim of their own brilliance
5867591 i think when youve got good players around you it wouldnt ever be spoken about because theyll win the games of footy
5867592 i think this year as much as people might be critical thatll train him up for when the side should be in a better position on the ladder challenging for a finals berth and then watch this space because hes using this year as practice
5867593 hes going to be a sensational leader and hes growing and growing all the time the fabric of the person is that you can build a club around this guy and there will be a team that will follow and do whatever he asks or demands of them
5867594 it was a little bit embarrassing to be honest with the amount of attention that he got after that game because he was so good
5867595 and the fact that he did a lot of it against me was a little bit embarrassing
5867596 a lot of the players in the league have had the same situation as i had that night and you feel a bit helpless sometimes hes that good a player if i get him ill be trying my best to shut him down and hopefully my teammates give me a bit of help
5867597 its pretty tough to go to a bloke once theyre on fire
5867598 and he definitely was that night it was probably the best individual game of the season and im not too sure if ill get to him from the first bounce or not
5867599 im going to have a big day no matter what whether it be him or joel corey or jimmy bartel or joel selwood take your pick
5867600 we cant go into the game worrying about the one player
5867601 theyve got such a good midfield and such a good team that we cant go in just focusing purely on gary ablett having all my teammates help me out if i do get the job and then letting corey and bartel and selwood get out of the loop
5867602 its just going to have to be a team effort on the day and north melbourne versus geelong as a team rather than whoever it is versus ablett
5867603 every week he performs and just his consistency this year has probably been the stand out to be able to play to such a high level every week is amazing
5867604 i think hes still got a another good three or four years left in him as well so hell probably be vital for us this week again as he is every other week
5867605 ive been sailing back from port stephens and came in late last night and came in to a strange sucking sound on the bottom of the boat
5867606 it sounds like someone with a great vacuum cleaner trying to suck the bottom of the boat
5867607 but i realise now the whale must be sick or something its sort of limp
5867608 it is a possibility it could also be just venturing and exploring as well because young whales do that
5867609 obviously we need to know a bit more about humpback milk composition
5867610 it is really really painful to remember many of our people were killed and nobody has really listened to them
5867611 wed all like to go there to that commemoration area wed like to go there
5867612 my familys at willowra from my grandfather and grandmothers people
5867613 people still talk about the 1928 massacre as if it happened yesterday
5867614 an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind
5867615 next week tuesday through thursday 26 28 august well be offering a free flash cast training course for anyone interested in learning how to develop flash lite 1 1 training course on monday the 25th august if you dont have any flash lite development then its not necessary for you to attend this training
5867616 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
5867617 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5867618 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5867619 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5867620 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5867621 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5867622 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5867623 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5867624 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5867625 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5867626 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5867627 maar als men goed had gezocht had men allang geweten wie ik was
5867628 these are the receipts of the transaction duplicates youd better keep them as the account is in your name and youll need them for income taxes and here is a copy of a poem i wrote yesterday
5867629 we are a nation founded upon christian principles we are a nation under god
5867630 the moral truths revealed in the bible are also consonant with reason
5867631 rather than argue from gods commands down to human endeavors social conservatives should place their emphasis on human flourishing and the moral principles that protect it
5867632 this is the precise argument that social conservatives should be making when it comes to abortion human cloning and embryo destructive research
5867633 the universal moral law valid in every time and place
5867634 faithful to ourselves to our true nature and our deepest aspirations
5867635 i couldnt figure it out and she was like oh my god oh my god
5867636 hes one of the favorites for a medal right now
5867637 were all staffed up and ready to go and looking forward to it
5867638 i can hardly catch my breath now and it just keeps building up
5867639 no matter what our guys are going to win the gold
5867640 if people could have watched our practices they would have paid who knows how much to get in
5867641 for us the games were just an appetizer for the next days practice
5867642 i love the mix they have to this team it resembles our team
5867643 no one cares who gets credit for what no one cares how many minutes they play or how many points you score you check your egos at the door
5867644 did you interrupt my coffee just to ask me that question
5867645 it helps with their social needs keeping them involved with their environment and it helps lift their day and makes them feel like they belong in the community
5867646 we laugh we have a good time and they get to move around a little bit even if youre in a wheelchair it doesnt matter you can still get involved in whatever were doing here
5867647 its not required of us but we do one for the safety of the people
5867648 except youd gone off to fight and i didnt want to see the effects of your battle on your human form
5867649 fire youre making no sense what are you trying to say
5867650 there is a new resident here aila she she too is us
5867651 aila has felt your life force here and she feels it as a total threat to her she shes sworn to find you and kill you
5867652 i really cant ask you to understand this battle deraj it is something solely between me that wretch and that weakling who calls herself an evelonian trainer
5867653 if you are too hasty aila then i doubt lady saouna would give you a second chance like she gave to tali
5867654 do not speak to me of the second chance saouna squandered on that wretch she was better off dead
5867655 i was going for a walk youre in my way please move
5867656 so you are a fool tali you died once and saouna smiled upon you this time you shall die and none of the goddesses shall look upon you with favor no not even zuhai xaire or taxat shall listen to the pleas of those around you
5867657 and now it is finished wretch i have won the battle you have lost you are just a weakling who is too sentimental for her own good you are a slut too how many lucain in evelon can boast that they have great grandchildren yet only be twenty one
5867658 i guess i had nothing to fear after all your rebellious streak it is just from being a strong willed female saouna will not hear your cries this time
5867659 and this necklace it will look simply beautiful on me
5867660 nyera find chanda see if kria will come as well i know chanda is bound to know something about healing a fatal wound
5867661 i do appologize for my mates behavior i truly do
5867662 chanda im so glad you could co kria thank zuhai you also came please we need help
5867663 let her go there is nothing we can do to save her it is too late
5867664 you are the one that we in this household look up to you cant say this
5867665 let her go you guys she wont be able to recover anyway not unless someone here gives up their life to take tali as place
5867666 i wish i could say i am honored to meet you
5867667 but i am afraid i must pass on tali as dying words to you
5867668 she said that she is sorry she never told you her heritage she is a princess and that she will be always watching over you
5867669 there was nothing you could have done i had forseen this and i purposely withheld the information from you because i knew you would try to alter this course which would have made mothers death all the more painful because aila would have torn into your neck as well or you would have died from the pain mother felt because the closer you are to the one you are bonded to physically the harder it is to not be harmed by what they feel as if it had happened to you i forsaw mothers first death and i knew that lady sa would bring her back but i did not forsee that fire chanda kria and nyera would try to bring her back
5867670 if i had tried to stop this then aila would have killed me and then taken mother down as she greived for me i doubt that father could take the death of one of his two daughters by mother and mothers death without also dying aila is vicious when she is determined
5867671 take care of her saouna you gave her back to me once and it seems as though she is meant to be with you she is an angel one that i shall miss dearly
5867672 what do you want tali i thought i banished you from this realm

5867718 yes thats true and its no reason to make marijuana illegal and have to deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5867719 no marijuana doesnt cause lung cancer and heres the proof but even if it did cause lung cancer it still wouldnt be a reason to make marijuana illegal and deal with all the other problems of prohibition
5867720 marijuana offenders represent only a very tiny fraction of state prison inmates in the united states a recent review of those actually convicted and sentenced for marijuana offenses shows that they are overwhelmingly drug traffickers or multiple often violent offenders and not those arrested for simple possession or use

5868072 we will not be yes men in bn we have often expressed differing views from other parties within and even outside bn in other words we are not blindly committed to bn we look at our own ideology and principles
5868073 of course there are views expressed by leaders at various levels and we discuss them
5868074 every community leader has to talk about upholding the interest of his community
5868075 mca mic and gerakan say the same thing when they visit their communities
5868076 i am not blaming umno but this is something that needs fine tuning
5868077 as in any party there are different views and this is also happening in pakatan rakyat a coalition of three parties that also has to handle the issue of differences of opinions

5868079 how can her post mortem photographs be on the internet this was a police case the photos are supposed to be confidential and classified
5868080 havent we suffered enough losing our daughter why put us through further misery by circulating her post mortem photographs
5868081 what ah long i have never known or approached any loan shark
5868082 why were we investigated our daughter was abducted and murdered and they want to punish us
5868083 i want to do my part in ensuring no family will have to go through what we underwent in the past year
5868084 i pretty much came into camp thinking that we were so deep at running back that i was going to have to contribute on special teams to make the team
5868085 coach tom quinn the special teams coordinator has been great giving me opportunities to go out there on special teams and get some work in and im just trying to get better and better some of things ive never done but i just try to adjust to it as good as i can and go out there and be a player and get the job done
5868086 we have to keep going through the rest of the preseason and see what happens
5868087 they are always in my corner making sure i know whats going on and making sure i know protections my points all the stuff and its been great
5868088 all of them are my brothers and its going to be tough because somebody is going to have to go im so close with all of them right now i just want to have everybody out there but you know thats not going to happen so you just go out there and do the best you can with the help you have with them and the coaches helping me and just trying to get better
5868089 i got over here and started learning the offense immediately and started working on special teams so coming into camp i knew what was going on
5868090 i still didnt have it down but i was familiar with what was going on and i think as time went by ive gotten better and better and im just trying to keep going until i have it memorized all the way 100
5868091 i feel a lot more comfortable than i did when i first got here it was mind boggling when i first got here but now its starting to slow down a bit and im starting to pick it up a lot better
5868092 im just trying to go out there and give them the best look possible so they can make the decision themselves
5868093 im just trying to be a player be coachable let them tell me what to do and then i go out there and just execute
5868094 it enters your mind but you want to have your own legacy
5868095 if that happens thats great but i like the team im on now and i just want to be here when no 53 comes around
5868096 absolutely the quarterback trusts you that youre going to get both feet in bounds hands down i should have had that to be honest with you it was a little indecisiveness and maybe not feeling as comfortable as we should as soon as we got done with the detroit game we practiced in the back of the end zone and the side of the end zone when we practice we try to take it to the field
5868097 its a blessing to have toom who is an older guy willing to help young guys
5868098 the big thing he told me is you have to fall down you might not stand up at the end of the play but you get both feet inbounds and dont be afraid to fall with it
5868099 osi got a sack and i was very upset out there
5868100 thats the way it is when he gets a sack im upset and when i get a sack hes upset and i think that helps us we definitely fuel the flame if any of us get sacks i guess you can call us haters its not like were hating on each other its more like you got one now i have to get one or else im going to have to deal with you all week in the film room saying i got one and you didnt so i think that really helps us and we thrive off stuff like that
5868101 we will have to decide on how we are going to handle that but it is a serious injury
5868102 if there was practice today he would not be able to practice
5868103 we are saying right now that smith manningham and amani will come back
5868104 amani feels good and i am hoping that he can go and get right back in here and not have to be too concerned with what he does and doesnt do we are going to have to spoon feed manningham and smith back in and i am hoping that doesnt take more than just a day to do that
5868105 if he can practice and hold up through the practices i am figuring that he would then get the green light and if he does get the green light we will figure a way for him to play
5868106 its not fair to the other athletes here in beijing

5868126 nos dec an que en internet se pod a medir todo pero no es verdad las mediciones online resultan especialmente complicadas
5868127 el primer sistema de medici n est ndar internacional que definir las audiencias interactivas de una manera concreta y de f cil uso
5868128 si el tag est bien puesto en todas las p ginas de un sitio al final de la p gina con un solo tag por p gina etc y el software que lo gestiona en el servidor es bueno es uno de los sistemas de medici n m s fiables
5868129 miden cosas diferentes los tags miden la difusi n mientras que los paneles dan cifras de audiencias
5868130 el escenario ideal que definen los profesionales ser a aquel en el que funcionase una medici n de audiencia entendida como individuos que integrara las bondades de etiquetado de p ginas y panel electr nico con un proveedor o varios vinculada al adserving complementada con auditor a y comit de usuarios y contrastada con encuestas referenciales
5868131 hay que tener claro que la medici n de audiencias no es una ciencia exacta no se trata ya tanto de la fiabilidad de los datos como de la credibilidad que tienen las empresas de medici n

5868137 we will take some new measures to ensure that air quality will reach a new level after the olympic games
5868138 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
5868139 this is an exciting new approach to geothermal that could meet thousands of times us energy needs
5868140 its 24 7 its potentially developable all over the country and for all that we really do think it could be the killer app of the energy world
5868141 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
5868142 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5868143 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5868144 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5868145 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5868146 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers
5868147 e on does have investment in renewables and they are pushing forward this scheme we want them to go down this road and use that expertise and technology and stop cancelling it out by pushing forward a coal fired power station
5868148 this proposal is not a sound bite driven band aid
5868149 its a comprehensive solution that will give hope and relief for those who are hurting today

5868210 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

5868305 the only pattern that weve identified day wise is that the bulk of the burglaries have occurred on mondays
5868306 but the rest of the days of the week have also been hit and miss
5868307 usually burglaries of this type are used to fund drug activities
5868308 so the burglars may be sitting on the property which is unlikely or they may be taking it out of the area and trading it directly for drugs

5868329 i think oysters are more beautiful than any religion they not only forgive our unkindness to them they justify it they incite us to go on being perfectly horrid to them once they arrive at the supper table they seem to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the thing theres nothing in christianity or buddhism that quite matches the sympathetic unselfishness of an oyster

5868345 my wife told me that i tend to get too quick with my swing before coming out to brunei she reminded me to just enjoy myself here and to get on with the game
5868346 im a bit rusty but ill use my excitement of wanting to be out here again to my advantage
5868347 it was the greatest game for everyone and fortunately we managed to win it
5868348 we havent achieved anything yet but beating brazil with a result like this is wonderful
5868349 it was unbelievable you just have to look at the scoreboard
5868350 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5868351 hes a high scoring quick scoring player who plays shots to get boundaries and i think down the order he was wasted
5868352 when he has played for us hes always done really well he got a one day hundred against india last year and has got runs this year and i am going to give him the confidence to bat at number three with myself at number four
5868353 i havent thought about the twenty20 side yet but theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5868354 its key now to identify players and roles in the team ive identified how i want to play and its a case of getting the confidence in the players to do what they need to do and thats what im prepared to do
5868355 i want to give the guys a good run at it and concentrate on a specific role so when something happens and you need to change at least ive identified the roles the players need to play and they can just slot in and slot out
5868356 its still early days and i am sure gavin will bounce back
5868357 maybe the pressure got to him but i know he can overcome the bad patch
5868358 the conditions were tough out there in fact many of my players found it difficult especially the greens
5868359 it made all the difference if i had not pulled my game together on the back nine it would have been a different story
5868360 the greens were very tough and the course was playing very tight too
5868361 what for some is sin others do to the glory of god and the good dr pentecosts remarks notwithstanding i intend to go home tonight and smoke a cigar to the glory of god it is a kind of incense drifting to heaven

5868364 the festival organizers changed the dates and we are not available on those days
5868365 it is crappy demo but so what it is only a demo for gods sake it does not give you a clear picture of our next album because next album is gonna be darkest to die for album ever melancholy rock from the bottom of our hearts so we do are not sure is this gonna be ever released anywhere but we just wanted give you some clips to listen before you get bored or before you die
5868366 our contract with spinefarm expired and maybe there was a possibility to continue with them i do not know but we decided to start to looking for something new spinefarm records is ok but it seems like they have no interest or time for band like we are they have too many bands to handle thats why we felt like we are not getting enough things like promotion etc there are some labels who are interested in us but this time we are not gonna hurry we need a company who is ready to work for us with huge motivation at the moment i am writing new songs for to die for also other guys are writing new stuff we are gonna be alive in the future more than ever

5868378 its definitely going to be different but were not going to go too far on our second album the monsterican dream we went too far lets put it this way the producer of that album pushed the envelope too far we didnt see it until after the fact but he was pushing us in a very metallic direction but the songs didnt fit that direction the songs were in the same genre and style as our first album so they didnt fit the metallic production he gave the album that really alienated a lot of people from us as far as that album was concerned the arrangement and production of an album can change everything you could take a perfectly good song and give it a bad production and itll sound like a bad song if you take the same good song and play it on an acoustic guitar around a campfire or something youll hear it the way it was meant to be heard and go okay i get it now with production it can go either way you never know now we have more of a power element in the music writing as well as on the lyrical side of things of course its going to be a hard rock album thats for sure were trying to take the essence of what we are and how should i say it polish the diamond a little brighter

5868423 charity does not demand of us that we should never see the faults of others we must in that case put out our eyes but it commands us to avoid attending unnecessarily to them and that we be not blind to the good while we are so clear sighted to the evil that exists we ought to remember what god can do from one moment to another for the most unworthy creature and think how many causes we have to think ill of ourselves and finally we must consider that charity embraces the very lowest it acknowledges that in the sight of god the contempt that we indulge for others has in it something harsh and arrogant which extinguishes the spirit of jesus christ
5868424 they were surprised that she had been able to survive the fire and been able to walk out
5868425 she was burned but she seems to be coming around
5868426 we worried about her having some smoke inhalation problems but we x rayed her chest and she seems to be fine

5868443 and standards are also rising in higher attaining schools the number of secondary schools where 70 or more pupils gain five good gcses has risen eleven fold to 891 up from 83 in 1997 we are now putting 400 million of extra money into schools with the lowest gcse results
5868444 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5868445 there has been an enormous programme of social reform over the past 10 years that has lifted 600 000 children out of poverty we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off
5868446 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5868447 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5868448 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5868449 im angry im very angry if you wouldnt have came wed know nothing nothing
5868450 we have a water park two blocks away its full of small children why my neighborhood

5868453 i made it to match because this will be a perfect beer girl costume the blouse is a blouse i already owned the only other company i have bought from that makes their own designs and makes clothing to order is this place called cameo intimates com
5868454 its called a raquel cami garter and i purchased it from trashy com trashy lingerie is based out of los angeles and their own seamstresses make these items as you order them they have the best lingerie as far as quality and originality anywhere that cami garter costs about 150 bucks and the matching thong costs about 40 its a little expensive for lingerie but this is not something that will ever fall apart because its so well made hey when you lounge around the house in sexy lingerie all day you need to buy stuff that will take a little wear and tear i wear a bra i bought from them in my video ultimate cherry brady interview its called the cameo sheer comfort bra in the color sunflower its a 36g and its very comfortable both companies should take pride because they are really putting out some quality products

5868459 only my clothes sometimes i cry because i remember all my familys losses but this is life
5868460 my daughter she called me crying and i said dont cry because im here
5868461 they dont care that i dont have a house i know i have to work because my bills wont stop
5868462 i didnt even want to think about not getting into the medal round and i didnt want to leave anything to chance i would have hated to leave our fate in someone elses hands
5868463 legally its a stretch to think that they would be covered in the waiver and the evidence is the fact that they are conducting an environmental assessment under the nepa
5868464 why would they be complying with nepa if they didnt have to
5868465 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice
5868466 john mccain is pro life always has been and his administration will be pro life anyone picked as his vice president will respect those views
5868467 if you hate america so much why dont you move to cuba
5868468 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
5868469 here i had a better opportunity i understood i could attain my goal of becoming better for him if i were better hed be happier but it was too far away for him he didnt understand and thats why because of him im here alone with the understanding my dream was for him even though he could never be a part of it
5868470 ya kita lihat saja nanti siapa tahu hal yang sama akan diungkapkan
5868471 sebab itu tidak ada hubungannya dengan klien saya sejumlah pertemuan yang diungkapkan juga sudah di luar batas waktu dalam dakwaan itu kan after after ketangkap kpk toh yang anthony marah marah itu
5868472 kami sungguh bangga bisa mewakili negara kami yang berada dalam situasi sulit laga itu akan spesial dan menjadi pertandingan penuh makna
5868473 tak seorang pun bisa menghalangi kehendak kami untuk merdeka seluruh georgia akan mengamati kami dan bagaimana kami bertanding nanti
5868474 seluruh rencana perjalanan kami berantakan tetapi kami berhasil keluar melalui baku dan mendapatkan visa di sana kami mengubah rencana jadwal perjalanan tim karena bandara udara di georgia ditutup dan tidak ada penerbangan internasional
5868475 saya yakin orang orang di rusia berpikir telah menghancurkan kami dan kami tak mungkin berangkat ke wales tapi kami mampu mengatasi itu dan sudah tiba di wales tentu kami kehilangan banyak pemain tetapi bukan karena cedera kami memiliki pemain pemain yang bermain di klub klub rusia dan mereka tak bisa berangkat ke baku untuk memperoleh visa jadi pemain pemain itu tidak akan tampil
5868476 pelatih baru kami hector cuper belum pernah bisa bertemu para pemain secara memadai di georgia sehingga ia belum tahu pemain kami sama sekali
5868477 tim kami tidak sempurna tetapi ini akan memberi kesempatan bagi para pemain muda menjadi pemain timnas
5868478 following a rigorous review of operating performance and local market dynamics these company owned outlets are not producing acceptable returns
5868479 i would expect to see the existing metering and systems firms fleshing out their portfolios through acquisitions so that they can offer a full solution to energy suppliers

5868481 these figures should act as a wake up call to anyone employing it professionals
5868482 people management has not been an area of focus for many in the industry but the possibility of unhappy employees willing to leave their employer at the drop of a hat should help to highlight the issue
5868483 despite the economic doom and gloom of the past year the it sector has been pretty robust
5868484 while other industries fell victim to job cuts and declining profits it remained resilient the results of our survey show it is only now that we are feeling the effects of the credit crunch
5868485 it is at the very heart of businesses companies simply cannot survive without it and this survey demonstrates that it professionals understand this point
5868486 unlike during the last recession which was linked to the dotcom boom and bust this time it is one of the last fields to be affected by the credit crunch
5868487 had this trademark been allowed it would have given dell a monopoly over a term clearly in descriptive use what is surprising however is how long it has taken for this application to be rejected
5868488 googles programs are frequently described in this manner if dell wishes to protect its particular cloud computing solution it needs to give it a distinctive brand name and trademark instead
5868489 it could brand its solutions to make clear they are based on cloud computing technology without laying claim to the process itself
5868490 but the japanese dominated him so i like to dominate the person that got dominated i am the dominator laughter
5868491 and that is why i had to consult with a coach after every attempt and they had to correct my jumps to a certain extent
5868492 here in beijing there is a time difference of seven hours
5868493 and i have problems sleeping and right now in my country it is a totally different time and i have not been able to get used to the time difference
5868494 so i would not take that from myself and say that i could not or is it really possible i had to stay focused and say it is possible for me and say that if it did not happen today i still was not going to give up on my dream and for it to happen today is so surreal it is amazing to actually say that and have the world say that is amazing
5868495 i am very proud that we got a medal for athletics i think this is the first olympic medal we have won for this sport so it is always very hard getting to a championship and having to go through the rounds i am just proud that i kept my head up
5868496 any business thats on the riverwalk here is going to get something from this
5868497 you can just see theres about 1 000 people over there were expecting some of those people to walk down this way
5868498 having proximity to the statue right here on our patio i just think its going to be perfect for business over here
5868499 nossas equipes t m quantidades x de desenvolvedores x de testers e x de gerentes de programa o
5868500 em m dia estas equipes t m 40 desenvolvedores voltados cria o do sistema
5868501 algumas pessoas dizem que as equipes do windows s o grandes demais levando a problemas de engenharia leva tempo para criar o sistema um grande projeto acho que a equipe precisa ter o tamanho certo e ser gerenciada com efici ncia para que o seu trabalho reflita o pr prio tamanho
5868502 o iphone muda a forma de usar o aparelho com navega o mais intuitiva
5868503 antes o site n o era adaptado para usar com o dedo
5868504 nosso foco preparar o sistema de internet banking para o p blico que vai usar o iphone prestes a ser lan ado no brasil
5868505 e ainda podemos antecipar o uso por clientes que est o no exterior
5868506 heres what makes me most proud we have done it early and we have done it under budget
5868507 it was certainly the largest most complex project that ive ever participated in
5868508 it makes my life a lot easier especially getting onto the interstate i had to go several blocks out of the way before
5868509 when you still had the old pieces in there and we were putting things together sometimes i thought we were building a bridge to nowhere
5868510 there are a few days i left the design office thinking things werent going so well
5868511 to me days like this when we come out and see a successfully completed project these are one of the best aspects of being a design engineer
5868512 in all of those conditions there were no fatalities and major injuries for any workers or motorists
5868513 nobody getting hurt nobody getting hauled away in an ambulance is a major accomplishment
5868514 there were a lot of people frankly including me who were a little worried
5868515 i remember saying out loud as they said take it or leave it maybe we should take our marquette name off the project
5868516 ive been waiting for those exits down by the marquette campus especially and i was very happy to see they were open
5868517 and finished just in time for those students to come back tomorrow
5868518 well thats right and not bad that its in what we call blue and gold
5868519 especially milwaukee sending officers over there when they should be over here and taking care of the streets
5868520 i think the common council did the right thing today i thought it was very statesmen like i appreciate their willingness to come here in august and vote on something that is a national security issue
5868521 the people in my district are so concerned about the response time that they feel that somehow by sending these officers to saint paul that our response time will go to what they feel is bad to worse
5868522 this would be a great public relations campaign its a good will gesture i think we should do it
5868523 i find it really fun introducing the game to people who have never played before and are all excited about it i think it was very successful and the kids all had a good time and got better
5868524 we just saved about three weeks of time because having that 25 000 allowed us to do the inspection allowing us to fix the snowmaking and get all of those parts here
5868525 if we had to wait another month we then would be waiting for the parts thats what the key is as soon as we can secure the additional funding that randy and his people can just jump on a plane as long as they are available and get here in a few days
5868526 we really feel we have a good work plan that we just have come up with having randy come up and do the work and give us a proper quote means he is willing to sort of stick to that quote within the best guess unless he finds something that we couldnt find on the inspection but we dont anticipate we will find anymore because the inspection went pretty well
5868527 the key with hiring the general manager is that we want to be able to hire him or her as a year round operation so that when the hill does shut down the skiing operations at the end of april that he or she can focus on the marketing and looking at how the hill can generate revenue for the summer time
5868528 those are the things that we need to make money in the summer to support the extra costs required to run the hill in the winter thats why we need the year round manager because otherwise you just dont have any paid staff that can continue to move the hill to be self sustainable
5868529 we really want to move this hill to be as much as possible self sustainable
5868530 we really want to see in the future that we minimize the amount of funding that we would need from the government in the future its going to take a few years until we can move these things into place and start to build a model that allows us to have summer activities going on getting through the first year is important right now but yet starting to work on that five year plan is very important so that we have that vision of where we can go to
5868531 the kids that we brought were very good ambassadors for the yukon
5868532 they gave their best effort and they had fun they created some friendships and i know they are going to be texting each other like crazy across the country and thats what counts
5868533 well a medal is always a good thing so that was a good highlight
5868534 i think the team was very cohesive we really supported each other because our number being smaller it could be intimidating especially when you have ontario beside you with 100 people screaming their heads off but i think people appreciated the fact we were there and they were quite pleased to come and talk with us
5868535 encik dia orang dok tengah tengok olimpik dia mengaku dia teruja sikit
5868536 ive realised from experience that true change comes only with the cooperation and collaboration of all parties involved in terms of workplace that means the sharing of ideals that match the expectations of employers with those of employees both men and women
5868537 the gravitational forces pull the wrinkles down making them look deeper
5868538 by blending different sizes we can have fast and long term effects small peptides activate quicker than bigger ones so the product covers a longer time of collagen production
5868539 danny sulllivan tras anunciar el lanzamiento de un nuevo blog han anunciado el lanzamiento de una nueva conferencia sobre search
5868540 meminta pelaksanaan penuh dan segera gencatan senjata bagi rusia dan georgia
5868541 meminta penarikan segera pasukan rusia ke garis batas wilayah sebelum pecah bentrokan pada 7 agustus lalu dan kembalinya pasukan georgia ke markasnya
5868542 komitmen seluruh anggota terhadap kedaulatan kemerdekaan dan integritas wilayah georgia sesuai dengan batas batas wilayahnya yang diakui secara internasional
5868543 typically a breakdown of energy usage does not exist so an it manager does not understand how energy is used
5868544 we played well when we had the ball but defensively we gave the ball the way a bit too easily we have to improve in that area but that is what these games are for
5868545 overall im very pleased with the performance they looked fresh sharp
5868546 its always a good feeling to put one in the back of the net especially for australia
5868547 i thought we played well in the first half and overall it was a good result
5868548 in the past 12 18 months lexmark has been through a lot of re structuring and consolidation which has had an impact on the companys performance
5868549 the imarsat 4s are the worlds most sophisticated commercial network for mobile voice and data services and the successful launch of the third 1 4 allows us to complete the global coverage for our broadband services
5868550 this orbit allows inmarsat to provide global broadband coverage with just three satellites
5868551 despite the economic doom and gloom of the past year as other industries fell victim to job cuts and declining profits it remained resilient
5868552 it has been one of the last fields to be affected this time meaning it will be one of the first areas to pick up again when the economy revives no sector is immune from economic fluctuation but any downturn in it is only likely to be temporary because it companies simply cannot survive without it
5868553 i thought i was going to run 48 seconds i felt so good i was already getting a bit elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break my hamstring just really let me down
5868554 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5868555 its a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life but in the middle part of the race the hurdles were coming up very fast i just told myself what i always tell myself keep things tight
5868556 but its kind of like a car you race that car going max velocity and you hit a curve you can maintain control or you can crash and burn today i crashed and burned
5868557 i knew two miles in that unless there was some major catastrophe i could outkick a couple of people
5868558 were getting very positive feedback from people and coming up to christmas we expect it to really increase
5868559 they havent had that to sell before theyre going to make recurring revenue out of that with every pc theyll make a living even without any service calls
5868560 was unable to provide assurances that shed be able to protect the child in the future
5868561 i had a race plan but as usual it went out the window
5868562 i was in my own world people said did you know sanya richards had gone off very hard but she was in lane seven and i couldnt see her
5868563 all i had to work off was the russian girl outside me who i knew would go off very hard and at 200 metres i was annoyed with myself that i had left myself too much work
5868564 its something i have given thought to but its a long way away
5868565 the olympics will be 15 minutes from where my parents live that is where i was brought up where i have lived all my life it would be great if i could say i will be there but you have take each year as it comes
5868566 she could be one of our ambassadors but we have never discussed anyone being the face of 2012
5868567 its been a great british olympics i did not have nightmares that i would never be here
5868568 if you cant sell that then what is the london games about
5868569 maybe the face is not the one you want to see but if you cant sell the olympic world and commonwealth champion then what does that say about london and what we are doing
5868570 what she does is not easy but she has huge mental strength when it counts people say bad things about you because they want to bring you down and she has had to go through that for a whole year
5868571 how would you feel if you ended up in prison you have been released and you are trying to do your honest days work and people keep bringing up the past
5868572 but we cannot control what people think we do our job and people judge us on that job we invest in all sorts of athletes but she delivers the bottom line is that we get there and we perform
5868573 the most powerful technologies are those that disappear becoming embedded into the fabric of society
5868574 itll be ready to fly into low earth orbit within a year
5868575 all we need now is some extra funding but 1 5 million would get it airborne
5868576 weve been working with our open handset alliance partners to incorporate much of that feedback and finish the first devices
5868577 since those devices are shipping in the fourth quarter the platform is now converging on a final android 1 0 version
5868578 we are excited to welcome pc tools into the symantec consumer family and believe the combination of our two companies will provide additional value and choice for consumers worldwide to better enable and protect their digital life
5868579 by adding pc tools we build on the market leading success of symantecs consumer offerings and firmly position ourselves for continued incremental growth in a rapidly expanding market
5868580 we want to make it clear we are in the solid state business
5868581 this is just the first iteration of our roadmap we will be developing a range of products for a variety of market segments
5868582 im so proud of the movie satine and i created together
5868583 shes one of my great loves and to share her beauty and talent with the rest of the world was a dream come true this is our night to celebrate
5868584 you can plant olive trees now but not anything that produces fruit
5868585 if you have some on your property that produce fruit theyre grandfathered so you dont have to pull them out
5868586 youve got to change the salt water twice a week for 60 days its a fair amount of work
5868587 i used to cure them and give them to relatives and friends until enough of them told me they werent eating them it was too much work for that
5868588 were a little bit more expensive than what you might find at the grocery store but no more than the gourmet oils and olives youll get from a small producer
5868589 they use only salt brine for curing no lye and they cure them for 60 days in stainless steel vats
5868590 its an all natural process and just like our oil everything is grown and produced right here in arizona
5868591 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
5868592 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
5868593 totalitarismul inseamna intr adevar implinirea cautarii gnostice a unei teologii civile
5868594 lumea trece prin vremuri atat de grele si impovarate de raspunderi incat se impune demascarea pe calea religiei a tot ce este echivoc vremelnic si tainuit nu pacea ne a adus hristos ci sabia cu aceasta sabie spirituala va trebui impartita lumea in cei ce stau in jurul lui hristos si in cei ce i se impotrivesc lui
5868595 the beyond next stage concert is not a beyond concert it is actually a show from members of beyond whore now doing their own thing
5868596 i know that fans are hoping to see us together we usually perform together in china and hong kong and this is the first time that ka keung is not joining us due to his solo commitments
5868597 our recording contract had expired and we felt it was time to do something new
5868598 we have been exploring new creative opportunities in recent years i switched from being a drummer to a singer and songwriter
5868599 if we didnt pursue our solo endeavours we would not have known what we are capable of
5868600 the interesting part about my work is translating complicated facts into results consumers can understand
5868601 we translate science into something they know there is never a need to have that same scientific depth for consumers
5868602 the scientific part of it is intact we are very firm in accuracy its important that when the language is simpler the facts are not modulated into something untrue
5868603 but most importantly you have to use the products correctly i have seen the efficiency of anti ageing products reduced by 30 per cent when used after a cleanser which is too strong as opposed to a mild cleanser
5868604 you couldnt get the desired effect the strong cleanser causes inflammation instead of producing collagen with the anti ageing products your skin is busy repairing the damage
5868605 if you are 25 of course it will not give you that 61 per cent reduction
5868606 its just like a car if you drive fast all the time it wears out faster if you normally achieve 160 000km you may reach 190 000km if you drive slower
5868607 i said to myself oh this is not so easy
5868608 it took me 36 hours to get from new york to kuala lumpur a little bit long but its all in the past i got my luggage i have my clothes im happy
5868609 and skincare is based on patience be patient dont abuse your skin dont torture it with fillers stripping botox all these are horrible just give it time use good skincare products regularly and correctly and after three months i guarantee satisfaction when its your skin go in with a reasonable approach
5868610 they damage the skin and then come in with wound healing response i believe in just working in synergy with the skin and enhancing the repair process
5868611 time is the real essence of survival and success a bit of perseverance and consistency will give you real benefits do not change products all the time use a product consistently for three months use it diligently and everything will be fine
5868612 i also learn that women do everything they can to damage their skin you need to give skin time and you cannot hurry it sorry but biology doesnt work in that hurried way and estee lauder or any other company cannot change that
5868613 research will be done by someone very competent its not good to leave without making sure everything is in order
5868614 yeah you were there when we were ganging up on hussein
5868615 he fell for it it was all good fun though
5868616 i attended the audition with some friends and decided to try my luck at hosting throughout the audition i was just being me goofing around and cracking a few jokes
5868617 a lot of people who dont know me think that i am arrogant little do they know that i am the clumsiest member of ruffedge and that i am always the one with the one liners
5868618 adlin and radhi are tough acts to follow they are unique im just going to do my best
5868619 the prank we pulled on singer ani mayuni ended in drama we planned it with her husband on the day of the prank her husband pretended to go outstation to work but ani was told that her husband was having an affair in the end she was in tears
5868620 he is so in love with his car no one dares to touch it we ganged up with his brother and managed to get the cars spare keys
5868621 he searched for his car frantically if it was someone else who drove his car he would have beaten the person up
5868622 some take it in the spirit of fun while others crack under pressure but we are lucky enough that there have been no serious mishaps
5868623 there are also some who request that we do not air the prank we have to respect that we also have our limits
5868624 we have recorded two songs rintihan pengemis and jangan berhenti both showcase a more mature side of the band hopefully we will appeal to the older crowd
5868625 nine and iwan joined this year they are an asset to the band both are experienced singers and have great vocal harmonisation
5868626 they are doing this for no other reason than to make more money
5868627 this is ridiculous and i assure you that the millions of harry potter fans who have been looking forward to this release will not stand for it we dont want to be pacified we want the movie as promised this november
5868628 im totally convinced that the decision was motivated by money and only money

5868630 ik ben al 4 maand gelukkig samen met mijn ventje
5868631 eigelijk hoop ik h l stiekem dat er nog v le maanden bij mogen komen maar er is zo een leuze die zegt dat je niet mag verder kijken dat je moet genieten van de huidige momenten dus doe ik dat ook
5868632 it could a salesman he talked to at gwatney it could be a friends phone number we just dont know
5868633 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for
5868634 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5868635 it was time for me to describe to myself what happened the night i could bear no more and finally decided to take action i needed to go back there as i knew i would always have to over and over again
5868636 who can save us now brand new superheroes and their amazing short stories
5868637 the fortune cookie chronicles adventures in the world of chinese food
5868638 the doctrine of self government is right absolutely and eternally right
5868639 when the white man governs himself that is self government but when he governs himself and also governs another man that is more than self government that is despotism if the negro is a man why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with one mans making a slave of another
5868640 allow all the governed an equal voice in the government and that and that only is self government

5868707 for the government to declare all out war against the milf would be the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit

5868714 in schools now children learn everything about food but not how to cook it unless they actively pick that as a subject option
5868715 yet everyone involved in food at any level emphasises that the only way guaranteed to get children interested in new healthy foods is to get them cooking
5868716 cooking in schools would previously have been backed up by observing cooking procedures at home but when parents havent been taught to cook the problem continues to worsen with families of all ages knowing little about nutrition local food or how to cook it
5868717 formal evaluations of the success of the cooking buses are measured by how much of the information and skills are retained and officials from the food standards agency said they were astounded by the sheer amount of information children retained even three and a half years later
5868718 furthermore they built on that children were saying i taught my mum to cook i taught my gran to cook we kept all the recipes at home and we still make them and you can clearly see both the enjoyment and what theyve learned to do all wrapped up together some of it is about confidence and getting used to situations that simply never happen at home such as preparing a meal and sitting down to eat with other people it might seem perfectly normal to some of us but other families will never have done that
5868719 thats exactly the sort of thing we want to see
5868720 its great when schools take the initiative like that and if i had my way id like a minimum of another three buses in scotland cooking doesnt have to be complicated and it can be taught from a very young age
5868721 so far 200 schools have applied for visits from the cooking bus and were keen to see other schools do the same
5868722 by training more people to teach cookery and involving the community especially in deprived areas we want to make sure more people understand the link between food and health and preparing them to make informed choices about what they eat in the future
5868723 i love cooking for other people and thats what i want to achieve with the cooking buses getting people involved in something which is the most basic human skill but can be learned by everyone with wonderful results in terms of health as well as sheer enjoyment start them young and their enthusiasm will have no limits

5868845 its very early were doing a test in the local seattle market and its exactly that
5868846 that means you can do it in places where these traditional hydrothermal reservoirs dont exist
5868847 if you drill deep enough anywhere in the world is hot enough so the places that will develop engineered geothermal systems first are the places where it is hot shallow
5868848 there are so many places to do it why bother taking the risk
5868849 these are people who are known for being fairly good at figuring out where technologies are about to break
5868850 we see it as more than just money it is a confirmation of what we are doing at altarock
5868851 i always walk to school its very good for me and the environment i know a lot of people who still take the car to school even if they live a short distance away when i peel potatoes i use the peelings for compost to help the garden grow its important to recycle and do composting otherwise peelings get sent to a landfill site where it gets put in the ground and burned one of the most important things is to switch off things when i go to bed i always turn off the tv another thing i do before i go to bed is switch off the computer a lot of people leave their computer on standby and that uses a lot of electricity

5868854 well the defense has filed a motion for the judge to recuse himself from this case however the judge has overruled that motion a decision that we do agree with however the defense has the right to appeal this judges decision to the ohio supreme court and if that occurs we will have to wait for them to make a decision

5868856 the idea of a goddess of destruction is one that ive cherished for a long time cedric victor bassist and visual collaborator mentioned kali when we were recording because of the thematic similarities to the songs i had already written
5868857 as we progressed everything seemed to come together around this theme of respect reverence for strength and simultaneous repulsion fear of power kalis narrative also discusses nietzsches old adage that in fighting the monster one must be careful that one does not become the monster which seems to be a relevant message
5868858 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5868859 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5868860 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5868861 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5868862 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5868863 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5868864 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5868865 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5868866 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5868867 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5868868 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5868869 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5868870 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5868871 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5868881 there has been a lot of misinformation circulating about plasma hdtvs and longevity and were happy to once again set the record straight on the durability of panasonic plasma
5868882 quite simply our plasma tvs are built to last a very long time as much as 100 000 hours to half their brightness
5868883 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
5868884 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
5868885 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
5868886 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
5868887 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
5868888 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the centre of it
5868889 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
5868890 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
5868891 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
5868892 this is the position i want to be in and i just hope i have enough left to get to the finals
5868893 its not that it limits me but i am aware of it
5868894 i dont recover as quick i need more physical therapy it takes longer to move on to the next training session

5868896 the first year in 05 he could only do a lot of things gingerly he couldnt run we had to taper training
5868897 hes a bit calmer before the event he doesnt get keyed up you can tell hes not getting too worked up over the small things

5868902 for arable farmers recent poor weather will impact on this years yields and increased supply of cereals globally will affect still further the margins that scottish farmers can achieve rising costs will squeeze these margins
5868903 consequently it is important to review the way in which farm and other rural businesses are conducted in order to mitigate the impact of increased costs we are advising clients that they should do this sooner rather than later as such changes may take time to implement
5868904 those who might have been affected should still contact their accountant to clarify the relevant recognition date new rules on income shifting due to be introduced in april 2009 also need to be considered as these are likely to affect a number of farming businesses and arrangements that might suffer need to be reviewed and amended as soon as possible

5868906 as animation continues to be plagued as the single most misunderstood film medium the animated short film is sadly undervalued and underexposed in american cinema despite widespread appreciation throughout the rest of the world
5868907 the theatrical animation festival was born in 1976 with the launch of the
5868908 the animation show launched in 2003 making it the first festival of animation created and produced with actual animators at the helm a sister series of high quality animation show dvds now supplement the theatrical tour with additional insights and brand new lineups of films while the main show remains a unique and unforgettable annual program that is usually gone forever once it is out of theaters every year the show works diligently to put animated shorts into more theaters than any festival in american history giving these filmmakers the wide exposure their work deserves and sharing their short masterpieces on the big screen where they belong
5868909 we consider the bill absolutely unfair and highly discriminatory because it singles out registered professionals
5868910 how is the government actually going to require compliance when it is not in a position to physically bar professionals from leaving the country
5868911 we have a huge glut of professionals in many sectors in the case of nurses the main reason they are leaving the country is because wages here are grossly inadequate and the pay is meager precisely because of the massive surplus of nurses this is the law of supply and demand at work
5868912 the demand is so heavy that well known construction firm doosan heavy industries amp construction is willing to pay as much as 5 000 a month for architectural engineers
5868913 there is no placement fee for the professionals needed in dubai
5868914 if this arrangement is tolerated it would certainly spawn the abhorrent practice of contract substitution to the detriment of the filipino ocws

5868923 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
5868924 like i have said from the beginning i have never committed an illegal act
5868925 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess
5868926 this misguided policy will increase ticket prices for consumers and hurt struggling small market airports while doing nothing to relieve or mitigate delays
5868927 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

5868931 he was traumatized and upset about what had happened and had been up all night long and he had several drinks
5868932 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5868933 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5868934 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5868935 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5868936 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5868937 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5868938 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5868939 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5868940 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5868941 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

5868946 this may provide us with new insights into the types of food parcels we offer the food we request from donors and the time we expect a food parcel to last for
5868947 in no time at all you really crave a lettuce leaf or some fresh fruit
5868948 we have looked at 21 different premises in mount victoria and the surrounding area and none are suitable the only place that is suitable is bandoliers
5868949 to be on the town belt you need to be using the area for recreational reasons and because we are not recreational we have a problem
5868950 it is ideal in every respect the building is suitable and is in good shape there is an outside grassy play area it is within walking distance for many mount victoria families and there is an appropriate parking space
5868951 my hope is that council will look favourably on addressing that matter the town belt management plan to enable it to be used by the cr che
5868952 its a simple concept but it really does work for many boys just knowing there is a man he can trust to turn up and listen does wonders for his self esteem and gives him a sense of place in the world
5868953 with the cost of rentals so high at the moment its important that the council can support organisations like big buddy to ensure they can continue to offer such wonderful services
5868954 our research of paraparaumu train users found that more than 250 of those who drove to the station said they would take the bus instead if there was no extra cost
5868955 the cost of this initiative in terms of lost revenue on the buses will be about 300 a day but this cost will be covered by the extra revenue from new train users we are also reviewing bus services in kapiti to see if there are any savings that can be made from reducing uneconomic services

5868958 the donation comes as mr golisano a three time candidate for governor has been using his wallet to re emerge as a heavyweight in state politics and worrying republicans that he is leaning to the left in his latest political incarnation

5868961 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
5868962 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5868963 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5868964 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5868965 there does not appear to be any pattern of any type where there is an attempt to harm someone
5868966 rummaging around in the drivers license records and those types of things
5868967 there is at this point no evidence whatsoever any public officials were targeted or any political maneuverings going on
5868968 i know anything that involves the thp is juicy fodder
5868969 but the last couple of years theyve done an awful lot to clean that place up
5868970 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
5868971 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people
5868972 my voice shakes when i speak in front of 50 people at work at a meeting
5868973 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
5868974 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
5868975 one risk of moving to invesco field is that images of a stadium full of cheering supporters could fuel gop attacks on obama as the worlds biggest celebrity and someone not serious about leading the country
5868976 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5868977 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
5868978 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5868979 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5868980 it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of financial disclosure
5868981 in texas we have a long tradition of not talking about the number of cattle you own or your net worth
5868982 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5868983 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500
5868984 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust
5868985 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5868986 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that

5869016 the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5869017 its an awful era in a sense because its the age of narcissism its probably worse than global warming
5869018 it must have something to do with the flood through every part of society of popular culture of film photography television and performance all this look at me stuff people dont read as much they cant write you get film stars giving their views on everything its quite serious but nothing can be done about it as soon as you complain you look like an antique
5869019 this seems to be a ghastly pattern i started another novel and spent 18 months maybe two years on it then i put it aside its not to say i wont go back to it it was nothing but a man and woman talking and i thought aside from the difficulty i was sick of men and women talking anyway but there had to be more underneath the same thing happened with eucalyptus i spent a couple of years mucking around with a book that i wasnt comfortable with i chucked that one out
5869020 has aroused the ire of musicians and not all of them classical traditionalists damon albarn lead singer of blur and co creator of gorillaz argues that schoolchildren should be forced to learn staff notation
5869021 it depends what you believe a secondary school musical education is for if its about accessing the western classical tradition then of course you need to learn staff notation if you think its about giving children some understanding of a wide range of musical traditions then teachers should have the flexibility to talk about other ways in which music is transmitted

5869025 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows
5869026 as more and more of this material is being sold to china we wanted to know the impact that was having on the environment and specifically whether the co2 emissions from the transport outweighed the benefits of the recycling
5869027 although this study is only part of the environmental impact story it is clear that there are significant co2 savings that can be made by shipping our unwanted paper and plastic to china
5869028 in some cases we just arent able to reprocess everything we collect or there isnt enough of it to do so in these cases shipping it to china which has a high demand and need for material makes sense in co2 terms
5869029 wrap will continue to build both the environmental and economic case for domestic recycling
5869030 if you take this into account the transport emissions are even smaller less than one tenth of the overall amount of co2 saved by recycling
5869031 the growth in exports is in part a success story reflecting the rapid development of the uks collection infrastructure and increase in recovery rates exports to china are bridging the gap between plastic bottle collections being established and the future development of domestic reprocessing capacity
5869032 it may seem strange that transporting our unwanted paper and plastic bottles such a distance would actually be better for the environment but that is what the evidence from this study shows
5869033 we do not have a manufacturing base here ideally it would be dealt with here but we would far prefer to see it recycled in china where it is a resource than landfilled in britain
5869034 this is an exciting new approach to geothermal that could meet thousands of times us energy needs

5869295 my goals at the start of this year were to make the top 70 in the money list and to try and win an event
5869296 it didnt look as though i would get them for a while but now if i keep playing the way i am i might have a chance
5869297 six weeks ago i wasnt anywhere close to getting into the playoffs but i have played really good the last five events and worked my way in there
5869298 i cant recall a lot about it but i do remember watching the third one the deutsche bank championship when tiger woods and phil mickelson were going at it
5869299 hopefully i get to play two maybe three of them this year with these playoffs if you get hot at the right time you could go all the way
5869300 i had no confidence and then my coach came out to the july 10 13 john deere classic and we got some things sorted out in my swing
5869301 i ended up playing pretty good there finishing 29th and since then my confidence has just kept building
5869302 it was a fun week watching chez win from start to finish
5869303 no hay marcha atr s a medida que nuestros derechos avanzan como parte de una cruzada mucho mayor por los derechos humanos en el mundo occidental
5869304 those people should just watch the show were hiring rachel because shes a smart person rachel goes far beyond politics shes an expert on military affairs she was a rhodes scholar

5869307 the key to choosing a solid colored necktie is the texture of the fabric
5869308 i think overall we can say that we are over the kaunas result
5869309 itll always be a huge regret of those involved but i now feel weve moved on and can get on with our season
5869310 the obvious disappointment of going out of europe to kaunas was difficult for everyone in the group to overcome
5869311 we felt we really needed a boost and we got that initially with the win over falkirk and then the game with hearts which was an important one because it was the first home spl game of the season
5869312 the addition of mendes in that game was also a factor
5869313 we felt in the close season that we needed to boost the midfield and front areas
5869314 we got the front players in that we wanted to bring in that were within our price range and normally that is the hardest area to fill
5869315 the midfield area proved to the bigger problem in terms of timing
5869316 we had been working away behind the scenes to try to get the players we wanted but we were not able to do so in our preferred time slot
5869317 however we have achieved that now pedro mendes came in last week and young aaron too
5869318 i felt that one of the improvements we had to make was overall possession of the ball and make better use of it
5869319 barry ferguson took the brunt of that but you need the whole midfield to join in and help out
5869320 so i think each of the players we are bringing in will improve us in our overall ability of holding the ball plus the ability to get forward and support
5869321 of course given that we have now increased the squad that will mean some players are going to be unhappy because they are not getting a game
5869322 so some of them may leave during this transfer window and that may be an obvious thing
5869323 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3

5869347 se est convocando a la poblaci n por los abusos que la polic a cometi contra los discapacitados
5869348 la gasificaci n continu anoche la polic a corri a los j venes unionistas
5869349 nos est n llamando y criticando por mostrar los rostros de los que agredieron al comandante en pat no estamos de acuerdo con la violencia
5869350 lo que ha ocurrido hoy en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo haran respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
5869351 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
5869352 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional
5869353 por lo que cualquier intento de neutralizar agredir o reemplazar a una instituci n como la polic a nacional ser un intento destinado al fracaso
5869354 los indignados empiezan a ocupar el lugar de los indignos en am rica

5869356 la mal llamada libertad de comercio es una libertad que enjaula y una gran mentira porque es el nombre que el norte del mundo da a todo lo que no practica pero es todo lo que predica y como el paraguay de los l pez cometi el grave pecado de proteger sus propios productos e impedir el paso de la avalancha de los productos brit nicos y no se at al cuello la soga de la deuda externa que nos ahorca fue castigado
5869357 para saber si un gobierno rey o presidente agrada o no a dios hay que preguntar c mo ese gobierno trata a los pobres porque si los trata bien significa que est del lado de dios

5869377 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers

5869406 nonetheless our finding also suggests that individuals who survive into the highest ages have a health profile that is similar in many aspects to that of individuals who are seven or eight years younger
5869407 even though individuals in this age range have an increased risk of disability for each additional year of life the frailest and most disabled members of the cohort are those who are most likely to die at any given age
5869408 most individuals can expect to experience physical decline before they die but the postponement of this individual decline makes it possible for us to live into a fourth age

5869477 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd
5869478 they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting

5869505 the study will make recommendations on the design construction and operations for a new museum in windsor according to an administration report to council
5869506 its going to look at what attractions we should be celebrating here you cant predetermine what it will say thats the point of the study
5869507 the technical evaluations are needed to confirm the practicality and the feasibility of key elements of the plan must be undertaken it is essential that the design concept be based on technical and scientific assessment an initial project scoping and feasibility study will be commissioned to examine the issues in greater detail

5869511 upon completion of the project scoping and feasibility study the general scope of the project would be defined the overall practicality and feasibility of the project would be confirmed and a more informed decision could be made on how best to proceed with the balance of project planning design approval procurement tendering and construction
5869512 who could object to discovering whether a project that could transform an underutilized area of downtown is achievable if it is great if it isnt time to move on
5869513 the surest evidence of this undertakings credibility is the involvement of dave cooke former education minister current chairman of the university of windsor board of governors and if were very lucky

5869522 the republicans want to go out and borrow money more money before we have paid off our debt

5869531 generally when i play my best golf i stand over every shot worrying about where im going to miss it
5869532 id love to be able to be the guy who doesnt see the miss and stand there and play with that confidence and stop the reliance on adrenaline and intensity in order to get the best performance out of myself
5869533 when i do get focused i do hole putts thats one of the things i do when i get into the zone i can hole long putts good putts

5869535 it is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way
5869536 that may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see

5869543 thats right girl even with these old crippled up hands i can still beat your butt good
5869544 those hands look like hawk claws too well miss hawk i got something you can use to feather your nest
5869545 it was in the discard pile back behind that storage bin place you know the one that had the water damage when the pipes rusted out last week
5869546 it comes in bolts from the textile brokers this stuff was doubled over and tri folded before it was folded into these neat squares thats not a standard loom run off either this cloth is not dyed in these colors either the colors are woven into the fabric look at the back here
5869547 thats funny it looks so slick and shiny youd expect it to be cool to the touch but its making my skin tingle you know like wool with a static charge building up on it
5869548 oh my child the colors look at all those colors
5869549 yeah its like looking at a fruit salad with a rainbow mixed in
5869550 the colors are so rich these are pure colors in the center here not made up from just mixing dyes
5869551 primary colors auntie i learned about that when i took my classes in hair coloration i was head of the class in coloration once
5869552 oh i know you were a real good student at beauty school till you got sick from that poison i think you could still do hair now youre cured of them devilish drugs
5869553 i i dont know about that i really dont thats a lot of big responsibility i mean renting a storefront and leasing equipment thats something for somebody whos got their life together not like me
5869554 oh come on girl stop blaming yourself for something you already repented
5869555 am i repented huh then how come god wont forgive my baby how come my baby shakes and screams for no reason even after all these months
5869556 honey its a lot better now than when you first came to stay with me
5869557 no no no you already got a job un like me heh heh ill take care of my own baby maybe you ought to see if you can salvage any of that cloth make something nice you can sell for a lot of money
5869558 anything that nice would need hand stitching these old claws of mine aint up to it im afraid ill figure out something take care of your baby kiss her for auntie okay
5869559 oh this fabric goes real well with a fall color person like myself it makes me look younger oo oo oo and this light fabric makes me feel so warm i can feel my blood surgin all the way through me even my hands feel relaxed real relaxed oo glory hallelujah why do i feel so good
5869560 where in the heck did you hey thats made out of that fabric aint it
5869561 so quick well i sort of remembered something from my old owners manual
5869562 you know stuff about how to fix that slipping and stalling problem come to find out all i needed was the replacement belt stored under the machine once i got the machine to working i sewed up this pretty shift just for me
5869563 but why are you sewing without the machine i thought hand stitching hurt you something awful
5869564 dont know honey maybe all that praying i did over to the church finally got an answer all i know is that as soon as i touched that fabric my hands stopped hurting then thirty minutes later they were shaking and shivering with energy i stopped using the machine because it was too slow and clumsy for this delicate little piece here
5869565 oh auntie its way more pretty then i can pay for
5869566 then dont pay for it i figure this beautiful cloth is a gift from the al mighty hes answered my prayers for relief from my pain and poverty i can work again and just having all this pretty fabric fills my head with all kinds of fancy ideas
5869567 you think that praying over to reverend granvilles got you this kind of a blessing i dont know auntie when i think of the stuff that passes for a church service over there gods blessing is the last thing i would expect from those folks they spend too much time screaming and talking gibberish to suit me i wont even take di over there not after they brought in those snake handlers last month
5869568 when it comes to other folks religion youre suppose to be more tolerant
5869569 i am tolerant auntie i wont bother you about where you go to see god i just wont come along
5869570 well i am too old and too poor to go to one of those fancy churches uptown mount bethany garden is the only service within a mile with my arthritis a walk in the cold and damp for a mile would leave me laid up sick for a week here girl this gown is done next time the baby wakes try it on for size ill fix it if its too big
5869571 oh im sure of that i just wish you loved yourself and god more
5869572 im learning to do both more each day but god is a lot easier to like
5869573 wow you made supper mama must be real busy if she let you cook
5869574 and what do you mean by that randy there aint nothing wrong with my cooking seen you gobble down plenty of it tonight
5869575 he means mama usually has a lot of pain and has to quit working by late afternoon so she has time to do the cooking besides you are always minding lady di this time of the day shes usually screaming her head off when we come in
5869576 thank you miss tia for the latest headline news well ive got some news for you lady di hasnt cried all the live long day
5869577 hm mm seems to me thats the first day that ever happened i thought crack babies had the screaming willies all the time
5869578 dammit randy my di aint no crack baby i was never on crack i snorted a little too much coke is all
5869579 and there is no such thing as any crack baby either randolph
5869580 those babies get crazy not from the drugs but from the druggies
5869581 any child born into a life of all night drug parties and sleeping wherever the junky mother passes out is gonna be a little uh maladjusted no
5869582 think about it son for some poor soul eager to come into this world they gotta wait around heaven for a chance at life theres lots of souls already ahead of them in the line finally one day they get a break the angels drop them out of heaven into some junkys belly then how do they get treated you really think theyre happy about nine months of pregnancy with more coke going in the baby then calcium
5869583 then after the baby is born its got to eat off whatever money the junky mama dont spend on the drugs heh that dont leave much for the baby to be happy about thats why they scream so much darlin theyre totally pissed at their mamas at life even at god himself
5869584 even when i was drugging i always took care of my baby first
5869585 she wasnt dirty she was just lonely werent you snookums
5869586 sure di needs love and kindness all the babies do but the angry babies need to eat and be changed on a regular schedule before they will stop being scared they need regularity to feel safe and they need attention before they stop being mad at their mothers that means the mother got to stop running away scared of her own baby too
5869587 well i may have been gone a lot when she was first born but im making up for it now ive been trying to make her feel truly loved for weeks today is the first day she seemed happy all day its like her new outfit cheered her up does that sound like a wacky idea
5869588 oh no jacqueline besides i agree that is one very pretty ensemble there lady di looks so beautiful in all those happy colors what an unusual pattern that material has
5869589 whoa wow what energy this dress has got some kind of positive energy to it its like touching an outlet what is this stuff whered you get this dress

5869594 uh yeah she actually holds onto the hem and stares at the colors and coos i call it her rainbow happy dress

5869612 oh h h girl look at me i look like that judge judy on tv
5869613 you really look wise and high powered desiree despite jackies bad jokes once the word gets out how wise you look i imagine folks will be lining up around the block to ask you for advice
5869614 oh thank you maybelle im gonna get over to the shop right now i forgot i got somebody coming but thanks all over again i wont forget this
5869615 it seems to me i gave you the cloth to make some money auntie making free clothes for the family well its not gonna help with the bills
5869616 oh but it is jackie once everybody sees how good you all look theyll come running to me to sew for them thats free advertising and i could use some of that
5869617 but i dont think seeing us will get too many folks to stop by we dont get around all that much
5869618 i got more ideas to help that now that my hands dont ache anymore i can sew good enough to beat the band and ive got enough of the fabric and scraps left to make some display shirts and such for the window folks will come in right off the street to make orders when they see my pretty rainbow happy outfits out front
5869619 wow so it seems like things are looking up for us huh i mean that fabric it was a real blessing
5869620 a little bit jackie and sometimes a little bit of a blessing is all you need
5869621 mable i was just thinking about you girl how are those children of yours doing these days i dont see them around on the street much since the snow fell
5869622 well to tell you the truth neither do i tia joined the school band so shes never around afternoons and randy god bless him once he got his grades up he qualified to be in the school tv club hes learning how to run one of them cameras

5869627 well ever since i made her a working smock from the rainbow happy cloth she has to beat the customers off her with a stick she earns enough to pay me for baby sitting lady di too
5869628 oh well praise heaven for that she owes you a lot from before
5869629 im not worried about before im just glad to see her life on a roll again is that some bad news
5869630 the news seemed bad at first but ive adjusted to it so you still have enough of that blessed cloth to make a jacket for jacqueline i thought that was all gone now
5869631 oh no the cloth is all gone all right but i re worked jackies lucky interview dress into a smock jacket now that shes got a job shell need a little confidence to keep it so she wont need the magic to find another job
5869632 i know desiree youve told me again and again the miracle is within us but i feel that sometimes we need a little magical boost to be reminded of it that cloth was just the help we need to bring our own miracles out
5869633 come have a cuppa with me ive got fresh ground the coffee came from my jamaica family today i want to make a toast to personal miracles
5869634 oh i think not i was simply wishing to watch that

5869642 theres a strange man in the house hes in emilys room

5869646 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security
5869647 central washington is gonna be the swing because right here voters will go either way
5869648 i believe that it is and we have enough republican votes out here
5869649 were going door to door were knocking and were going back twice and three times
5869650 right now weve been going door to door but weve been doing a lot of phone banking and successful fundraisers
5869651 i came from the other side and people think their vote here doesnt count but it does
5869652 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5869653 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5869654 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5869655 initially i got to pick early so everything went well but then i got a job and wanted to switch some of my classes it became impossible
5869656 you spend a ton of money i am an out of state student spending lots of money and you get here theres classes you cant take its just very inconvenient
5869657 the only class i had trouble with was an animal science class i had to wait list it but never got into the class im gonna try again next year
5869658 it could potentially if i run into another semester like this it could make me take an extra semester if nothing else i will have to take more hours next semester thats definitely whats going to happen
5869659 he has had dramas in relation to bullying he suffered bullying at the start of the year when he was doing his first course and his family dealt with that nothing had materialised in this particular course but it may be that he kept a lid on it
5869660 its been an ongoing thing and its obviously eaten away at him and come to a head on saturday
5869661 there were no outward signs that he was feeling depressed the indication from the family was that he was feeling good and his behaviour was normal
5869662 i think what cases like this highlight is the sustained impact that bullying can have it can impact on peoples relationships their confidence and how they interact with others
5869663 even when bullying might itself come to an end it can have that sustained impact and thats why we need to stop bullying and get that message out and in this case change the way people see those with a disability
5869664 i think it highlights that despite the changes in community attitudes towards people with a disability we still have a lot of work to do
5869665 the outraged women of mount isa felt that the mayors comments were archaic and it is totally not the image that we want to project for our city
5869666 we cant stand for this we need to get out there and say you need to go
5869667 they will have to do more than call for my resignation
5869668 i wont be resigning because im quite comfortable with what i said
5869669 mount isa my city has taken the olympic games off the front page of papers all over australia and the world and ive never heard of that happening before
5869670 people have supported me everywhere and at the moment i feel like im sitting on the top of mount kosciusko
5869671 i thought it was very degrading for the city and for someone in public office he shouldnt be speaking in such terms
5869672 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5869673 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5869674 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot

5869757 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5869758 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him view larger map
5869759 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5869760 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5869764 more than 90 percent of american wine production occurs on the west coast but because the majority of consumers live east of the mississippi a large part of carbon dioxide emissions associated with wine comes from simply trucking it from the vineyard to tables on the east coast a standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and generates about 5 2 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions when it travels from a vineyard in california to a store in new york a 3 liter box generates about half the emissions per 750 milliliters switching to wine in a box for the 97 percent of wines that are made to be consumed within a year would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about two million tons or the equivalent of retiring 400 000 cars

5869768 it was solid solid work i thought the fundamentals were pretty good one of the goals is that the effort every week has got to be exceptional and i thought it was pretty good getting close to it to have speed is one thing to use it is another and i thought we did a nice job of that i thought we played hard
5869769 i think the biggest thing would be to evaluate the players week to week hes stanton getting better thats what i like hes improving hes getting better within the system the opportunities hes had hes had a chance to make some plays but so has dan
5869770 i dont think they said he will be out for one to two practices
5869771 fb jon bradley went on the reserve injured list we signed clark harris tight end which allows another tight end to come back and play fullback if needed then wr taye biddle we waived injured and we re signed wr eric fowler who we had here earlier in camp
5869772 were always concerned about injuries as you lose any player but hopefully hell get over this hamstring hes felt pretty good on it today he said so wait and see
5869773 hes a guy who can come in hes been here and he knows the system a little bit he has good hands he can catch the ball well now we have to make sure to test his mettle as a blocker
5869774 hes a pro hes detailed hes been in the system for 11 years or whatever it is so he understands this system and the more you do the same thing you expand when you first learn you kind of play in a little box and the more you feel it your instincts start to come alive the correct moves are there and then you grow as a player
5869775 no we just felt and doc dean klineschmidt felt that in the afternoon we should not practice him
5869776 he just seems comfortable after the first one i just felt that he kind of got a little bit of swagger you know a lot of that is just playing obviously he can run and do some things with his legs and i just think each and every week youve got a chance to improve
5869777 it was better it was better its not what i want but it was better we got some nice cut off blocks in the backside this past week we cut some people and that was good we pushed into it better
5869778 i thought it was theyre getting more comfortable i think the more you do the same thing over and over and over the better its going to get you can kind of see it with the run game you just have to keep pounding it and keep pushing it
5869779 no we know hes a good runner hes a good tough runner he showed that in the first game too no hes a physical player
5869780 he blocked very well he got his hat on the right guy thats no one but hes been physical thats not an issue with him
5869781 all of that yes all of those possibilities are there but what we want to do right now instead of looking at that part is look at who are our best football players keep working through this week and the next couple weeks and find out who are the best players and then you start shuffling them around
5869782 i think hes doing solid hes banged up a little bit the thing im impressed with is that hes fighting through all of it
5869783 whats more meaningful to me is that the pad levels down the hustle the effort and were getting the correct run fits on defense i think were punting the ball very well thats whats meaningful to me
5869784 well right now it would be aveion cason and hes working at it he could just dig it out now but one thing with him hes very sure handed and i like that the one thing and we have to keep looking at everybody but i think all the way through camp we charted i think he had one drop the entire camp hes a very sure handed guy catching the ball all those things so that is top priority to me we dont turn it over then hes got good run ability
5869785 we usually talk about it at the end of the week right now im worried about just today is just all fundamentals weve worked against ourselves i take my hat off to this team i told them we just played a very physical game two days ago and we come out in full pads today and they go out and get a couple periods in they shorten the periods a little bit they came out and had a very physical work day against each other stayed up off the ground thats what i am interested in right now just keep developing i just want to develop the team
5869786 well i think its going to be the same theme ok i want to make sure were the emphasis on the run game we want to keep improving the run defense i want to keep improving penalties i want to reduce penalties i want to stay on top of that i want to have a really good punt team reliable protection and see us cover we didnt cover one last week we out kicked our coverage once and that just cant happen the turnover takeovers i want that to keep going
5869787 they havent earned it no i just stay on them right now they just need to get grounded into getting better
5869788 oh no i mean anybody they just thats why this game this week of practice and preparation is fundamental day they go into this game its important again for all those things i say i want to look at i want to see who wants to make our team too who wants a starting job and who wants this so its let them put it out on tape
5869789 yeah he seemed okay when you flip sides its different the assignments are all the same but the differences are the footwork and the technique and those things but he you know we got to prepare ourselves down the road to make sure you cant go into a game with one left tackle you cant so somebody has got to be able to be a swing guy
5869790 our team was down too yeah the whole team was down and thats each and every week a whole new event

5869918 nunca hemos aspirado a que nos entreguen la custodia de las gloriosas banderas y los principios que el movimiento revolucionario ha sabido defender a lo largo de su heroica y hermosa historia pero si el destino nos asignara el papel de quedar un d a entre los ltimos defensores del socialismo en un mundo donde el imperio yanqui lograra encarnar los sue os de hitler de dominar el mundo sabr amos defender hasta la ultima gota de sangre este baluarte
5869919 cuba con la moral que le otorga haber sido el p is que m s ataques terroristas ha recibido durante m s tiempo cuyo pueblo no tiembla ante nada ni hay amenaza o poder en el mundo capaz de intimidarlo proclama que esta en contra el terrorismo y est contra la guerra
5869920 first the dollar started to carve out a bottom last march and has occurred even as the news flow and financial events over here have remained downbeat but the reason for the rebound in the greenback is that economic conditions overseas are deteriorating across a broad front
5869921 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5869922 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road
5869923 but because interest rate differentials between countries are not a trading factor right now such speculation would have little impact
5869924 i hope that premier danny williams has done all he can in his power to secure work
5869925 whether this comes in a year or two or in two days time im coming back here
5869926 thats where the big numbers are in terms of employment
5869927 so it will probably take employment of 3 000 to 4 000 people at the peak period
5869928 when you commit to doing something and the labour is not there to do it that creates problems for the companies
5869929 thats where negotiation gets to be interesting how much can you do here realistically without compromising the project and compromising the schedule
5869930 i would say there at least 1 000 fishery workers without work
5869931 this is a government that hasnt signed on to any new initiatives that would offset that
5869932 ive been everywhere but theres nothing like newfoundland no place like home
5869933 we probably will see the canadian economy continue to struggle in the coming quarters
5869934 it wont be until early 2009 that we finally start to see signs that it is regaining some momentum
5869935 real gdp in june is probably up about 0 2 per cent
5869936 that economic growth in the second quarter is going to come in at about 0 8 per cent
5869937 when the economy is healthy its growing at around 2 8 per cent
5869938 weve been seeing moderation on the housing front as consumer spending is coming down after an unsustainable rate of growth in prior quarters
5869939 no question they were good in june but what its really doing is its helping to keep the economys head above water but only just
5869940 while we continue to believe bobs stores has great potential and an excellent organization our decision to sell the business reflects our vision to grow tjx as a global off price company
5869941 we believe that focusing on the significant opportunities to expand the domestic and international presence of our core off price concepts is the right strategy for us at this time
5869942 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy
5869943 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june julys 23 6 percent drop in multi family starts and 32 4 percent drop in multi family building permits is mostly payback for junes strong numbers
5869944 without a reorganization plan in place soon the company could face severe consequences and these same institutions will likely recover far less than under the ripplewood proposal
5869945 we are holding out little hope that this proposal will be approved
5869946 these banks and hedge funds are once again going to disappoint all of the 23 000 employees of interstate just like they have disappointed the nation with the mortgage debacle

5869948 on the whole the broad med tech market continues to show solid growth particularly when compared to other segments of the economy
5869949 we think the market is stable and kind of growing in the range we indicated before
5869950 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5869951 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5869952 all the negative attacks from the mccain campaign seem to have been paying off
5869953 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
5869954 o il is being drilled right now 60 miles off the coast of florida
5869955 but were not doing it the chinese are in cooperation with the cuban government even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply
5869956 right at this moment some 60 miles or less off the coast of key west florida china has the green light to drill for oil in order to lower energy costs in that country
5869957 china thanks to a lease issued by cuba is drilling for oil just 50 miles off floridas coast
5869958 even china recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores thanks to fidel castro theyve been given a permit to drill for oil 45 miles from the florida keys
5869959 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
5869960 it took a long time for the surge in commodity prices to seep into the general economy so dont expect one month of commodity price declines to suddenly turn off the inflation pump

5869975 canadian financials have to be treated quite differently were nowhere near the pain of writeoffs that have been endured by u s and european financials
5869976 the real story of this summer is the u s dollar rally and commodity prices going down which has triggered some rotation out of resource stocks and into financials so weve gone from a very dramatic oversold condition for banks to pretty much overbought conditions a few days ago
5869977 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation

5869986 basta chiudere tutto e riaprire non ce bisogno di riavviare le macchine
5869987 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5869988 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5869989 we have to be ready to explain reality to the deluded that miracles dont happen
5869990 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
