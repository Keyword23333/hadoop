5700007 many of us are not in favour of grabbing the federal government if a party wants to leave the barisan thats fine but i am against enticing individual mps to jump

5700012 today we have received an encouraging signal from mechel and other companies engaged in the sale of coking coal that they are voluntary ready to cut their prices by 15
5700013 this will be done after the format of their presence in the region has been approved
5700014 practically it means that the producer will also share in the advantage of value addition and that it should not be at the cost of any role player in the value chain
5700015 we know we are continuing to face the headwinds of the economic and retail environment
5700016 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
5700017 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
5700018 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
5700019 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
5700020 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
5700021 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
5700022 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
5700023 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo

5700028 we are working closely with our customer to do all that we can to assess the situation and recommend a course of action that will put the mission back on track in as little time as possible

5700030 this has been a difficult decision for the council to make but it has been taken with the best interests of the town centres regeneration and the people of rochdale in mind
5700031 there is real momentum in our town centre plans assisted by the recent news about metrolink and the funding approval for the new bus station
5700032 a drawn out legal dispute would have led to significant delays to the town centre redevelopment as well as substantial costs to the public purse
5700033 this way we can re run the process with the minimum delay and with the benefit of knowing the implications of recent case law

5700039 we knew from the outset that the eastlink was a roadway that had the potential for high speeds
5700040 tunnels present particular environmental issues when a collision occurs and we know what the devastating impact of these crashes can be
5700041 speed cameras form an integral part of the overall road safety strategy adopted by victoria police and we will continue to couple them with other enforcement and road safety initiatives
5700042 last year 172 fatalities or 52 per cent of the road toll occurred on 100km h roads which represents an overall increase of seven per cent from 2006
5700043 deaths on metropolitan melbourne roads with speed limits of 100km h increased by 38 per cent in 2007 which is even more concerning
5700044 these are not just mere figures they represent families and communities who will never see their loved ones again
5700045 we know drivers instinctively slow down when they see a speed camera and this reaction can save lives so hopefully this will make motorists think twice and the eastlink remains fatality free for as long as possible
5700046 we know drivers instinctively slow down when they see a speed camera and this reaction can save lives

5700055 entertainment needs are met through reality television because these shows allow people to make comparisons with media images comparisons that ultimately help them feel better about themselves and their personal circumstances
5700056 television and other media provide the thrill of observing danger without allowing people to suffer consequences
5700057 audiences know that when the curtain comes down and the lights come on in the theater everything is back to the way it is thats what reality television does for the regular viewer these shows are distracting from todays tragic events and give viewers an outlet for watching others overcome hardships escape danger live in a rainforest learn to survive under the roughest conditions and yes find love

5700082 the european record industry must act now to curb the illegal free downloading of music
5700083 the main blight on the industry is cd burning where an individual buys a cd and then makes several copies for friends
5700084 does anyone have any real evidence that having material available for free online whether legitimately or through piracy has actually caused any financial harm to any author the entire argument for encryption rests precisely upon this presumption a presumption which has never once been documented or demonstrated and which to the contrary has been cast into question any number of times
5700085 reprise records let wilco walk away from its record deal because executives said foxtrot an experimental pop album lacked an obvious hit single and therefore wouldnt sell
5700086 wilco offered the album for free on the web six months ago and it has since been vigorously traded on peer to peer networks making it the best test to date of the internets culpability in the current record industry slump
5700087 so the record industry cut their inventory and artist investment by 25 percent and sales only dropped 4 1 percent even though the economy is at rock bottom there were almost 12 000 fewer new releases for the consumer to choose from in 2001 than 1999 the record companies are making more money per release than ever

5700161 history shows a disturbing trend for religions that is when people no longer sense efficacy from this or that faith they generally abandon the god of that faith and move on to another one
5700162 a personal portable god is a late addition to the pantheon of gods
5700163 stone altars and high ceilinged temples occupy most of religious history a god who appears to man in human form is not uncommon since men get to form most of what they believe of god and can think only in certain themes men abandon gods the way they abandon centers of worship
5700164 lets just say that governments have bigger worries than chasing napster clones right now

5700181 to a large degree the music industry is then a fluke a bubble finally the bubble burst
5700182 if you dont believe it take a look at the way you make her paint her face and dance
5700183 when their music is used in movies in commercials and on internet sites artists are paid a licensing fee which after payments to the producer and the publisher is split 50 50 between artist and label although pressplay and musicnet license the music the bands are not paid a licensing fee instead the labels pay their artists a standard royalty for each song accessed by a fan as they would for a cd sold this means that the artist gets on average less than 15 percent instead of 50 percent but out of that 35 to 45 percent is deducted for standard cd expenses like packaging and promotional copies expenses that obviously dont exist in the online world
5700184 when my one hit wonder song goes platinum and receives 1 000 000 downloads i will have made a wopping 2 300 dollars almost enough to compensate the recording studio for greeting me ill bet scientology wishes they thought of it first

5700191 i dont usually give these out to people but you really seem to care
5700192 is not like a mutual fund its more like having a baby when you invest in a mutual fund you give your money to some financial outfit then sit back and hope that it makes money for you having a baby of course is different once that baby comes into your life it never goes away if you nurture the baby care for it and help it grow one day it will take care of itself and maybe even take care of you
5700193 i had the same exact score and thats what makes it a little harder to take

5700195 we tend to ask how can we make more money and sell more product not deal with consumer gripes
5700196 if a music industry executive claims i should agree with their agenda because it will make me more money i put my hand on my wallet and check it after they leave just to make sure nothings missing
5700197 lets take it from my personal experience my site www janisian com gets an average of 75 000 hits a year not bad for someone whose last hit record was in 1975 when napster was running full tilt we received about 100 hits a month from people whod downloaded societys child or at seventeen for free then decided they wanted more information of those 100 people and these are only the ones who let us know how theyd found the site 15 bought cds not huge sales right no record company is interested in 180 extra sales a year but that translates into 2700 which is a lot of money in my book and that doesnt include the ones who bought the cds in stores or who came to my shows
5700198 by the way why dont record companies object to the massive amounts of second hand recordings that are sold

5700218 if theyre infected with west nile where they have west nile fever or they have west nile virus meningitis or encephalitis these data can tell them what to expect that gradually over about a year their mental and physical function generally and on average will return to normal
5700219 i think at least it helps patients and physicians and their families to know what to expect over time
5700220 i had to learn how to start all over again walking you name it
5700221 whats interesting and what surprised us was the fact that there seems to be a lot of resiliency in individuals who had the encephalitis or meningitis or the milder symptoms

5700224 barry dempsey has helped to save the lives of many afghan soldiers and civilians alike
5700225 he had a wry sense of humour didnt take life too seriously and always had a ready smile for everybody he will leave a tremendous gap in the medical team
5700226 while we mourn the loss of a regimental comrade all our hearts go out to shelly and the rest of barrys family for it is they who have borne the real burden of his absence and they who have now sustained the real loss they are ever in our thoughts and prayers
5700227 barry was well liked throughout the battalion and the married quarters being a dedicated family man indeed his face lit up whenever he talked about his family and his world revolved around his two children

5700233 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5700234 which celeb had a hissy fit after a photoshoot she demanded a host of a list stars to pose with her in the picture but got a shock when all that turned up were a few minor boyband members
5700235 it seems though as if this b list celebrity couple is done he of the c list films and she of the a list television and b list films turns out he finally got sick and tired of the verbal abuse he took from the wife everyday not talking about three or four days a week talking about every day did she hit him absolutely although her favorite thing to do was to try and scratch him with the engagement and wedding ring he bought her he has had some lovely cuts as a result of this including stitches more than once he has walked out before but she has always talked him into coming back this time though he has been gone for ten days and isnt returning any calls
5700236 you have to remember that hungary is a very particular circuit and although fernando did a great job of keeping raikkonen behind him until the final pit stop this wasnt indicative of the pace of the two cars
5700237 indeed as soon as raikkonen broke away from us he was able to lap considerably quicker but having said all that the rest of the weekend showed the improved pace of the r28 and the improvements that we have been making bit by bit over the last few races so the performance in hungary reinforces the belief that we are moving in the right direction and gives me confidence that we can finish fourth in the championship and end the season with the third fastest car
5700238 we saw that bmw had a poor weekend and toyota had a good weekend but i dont believe the pecking order suddenly changes
5700239 there are certainly trends and at the moment we have a very distinct upward trend whereas bmw have a little bit of a downward trend and toyota seem to fluctuate so i dont think that the race itself shows a change to the status quo but merely reinforces the trends which have been developing for a little while

5700243 the peak district national park authority must strike a balance between the concerns and needs of local residents and conserving the character of the national park these designs do strike a good balance and id like to pay tribute to our planning officers representatives of local communities and their professional advisors for achieving a good consensus
5700244 we do sympathise with these concerns but in view of the fact that the highways authority has no overriding objection the planning committee must take heed of their professional advice

5700303 for mccain not only does it patriotism arise from his very being his identity but it plays a dual role of emphasizing a national security part of the campaign and the contrast between him and obama
5700304 hes going to demonstrate love of country by word and deed at the convention
5700305 its not something that you repeat i am patriot there are no specific patriotic activities its got to come across at an authentic and sincere way
5700306 conservative whites look at them blacks as unpatriotic and yet if you look at the constitution and the history the black community has been trying to make that constitution work for everybody
5700307 he has been in combat and i have been in combat but just because he is a running for office doesnt mean he has the right to run the country
5700308 shrewd of mccain to have planted those passages in 1973 in anticipation of the rise of the religious right

5700313 as you look at the specimens they are beautifully presented which is a part of what makes it accessible and interesting to people
5700314 from 3 4 5 year olds on up to senior citizens love the exhibit and young kids are as interested as anyone about learning how their bodies work

5700323 the great thing about it was when heath died those three actors came along and saved the day its now four actors creating one character

5700326 each of you gathered here today you deserve the recogination thats what i want to talk about today elected people set the policy and hire people to administer and manage the day to day affairs of government
5700327 there are neccessary and sufficient leadership characteristics that we need to find in people that will serve us both in elected positions and in our willingness to step up and provide leadership and be champions in our community they have to be willing to accept and embrace a diversity of opions and visions but without engaging and creating controversy
5700328 our challenge is to take the scholarship and make it enjoyable to a readership that enjoys history
5700329 the bible can be intimidating for people and the chronology can help people put the timeline together in their minds
5700330 we try to put our bible studies now in context of when things occur
5700331 it would give people i think a greater sense of how things were laid out in that way
5700332 i would say generally speaking that scholars would have no interest at all
5700333 what it ends up being is something that laypersons find helpful or would think it would be helpful any biblical studies expert worth their salt would not have much interest in this at all except as kind of a curiosity
5700334 it was very common in antiquity to attribute ones own writings to the most important historians in the past
5700335 it happens not just in the bible socrates certainly didnt say everything plato quotes him as saying
5700336 part of the problem and to me one of the flaws is the assumption that this bible is working with that narrative is the primary genre of literature in the bible that just isnt true
5700337 its like you would attach a pack of cigarettes with a warning label from the surgeon general
5700338 well this bible should have a warning from the theologian general or something this bible may be
5700339 first he did it and people were trying to stop him because he was getting bad cuts

5700366 the combination of weaker growth and higher inflation suggests that the voting could be split three ways again at the august meeting

5700372 it is not as if it is not going to cause the banks any pain but because theyve been dealing with it for the past few years it wont be as bad as it could have been

5700384 after my first year as president i decided it was important to be a part of the back to school process from the beginning we thought move in would be a great opportunity to meet students and their families as well as to help students get settled in their new homes
5700385 i look forward to welcoming our new students as well as the many who are returning to campus
5700386 this is my first year helping with move in im excited about meeting new students and helping with the process
5700387 we strive to make move in as smooth and painless as possible for the students and their friends and families we do appreciate the assistance we receive from dr goldfarb and the vice presidents as well as the many volunteers our success truly depends on those students who step forward to help their fellow students transition to campus
5700388 we spend the summer prepping our halls for the new fall semester so move in really culiminates our planning efforts we put forth during the break
5700389 if you dig down just four feet in illinois soil the ground is always 40 to 50 degrees by using the natural resources available to us literally under our feet we will have significant energy savings through the use of a geothermal system
5700390 we will not have to burn additional coal or natural gas at the heating plant to heat and cool the building and the cost of the system will ultimately pay for itself in energy savings
5700391 despite the especially hard winter we faced and then the heavy spring and summer rains we are moving along quite well
5700392 we hope to have the building completed late february 2009 with a grand opening set for sometime during the spring 2009 semester

5700418 dejemos desahogar a la se ora dejemos que se calme
5700419 hay dos cosas que deben cambiarse en el futuro eso de la paridad y alternancia y el hecho de que sean los candidatos y no los partidos los due os de las tarjetas

5700421 for decades the typical approach of hospitals and their insurance carriers was shut up and literally break off communications with the family
5700422 we think its important if the family is comfortable to be public about our mistakes so others can learn
5700423 the loss of a child is the worst thing that can happen to anybody
5700424 trying to prove that your son died because of a medical mistake makes it even harder the fact that they did recognize that it was their fault did have a positive impact on the way everything developed
5700425 its the right thing to do theres a growing expectation over a patients right to an apology
5700426 clearly it doesnt make things all better but i think it is a start
5700427 i think it raises the trust level between the survivors and the hospital
5700428 i tell hospitals you dont want to be like the old time insurance companies showing up on the widows doorsteps and saying sign here sweetie
5700429 i came to the realization that everybody was missing the boat
5700430 everybody thinks patients and families are out for blood out to sue the truth is they want somebody to level with them and they want to make sure it doesnt happen again
5700431 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5700432 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5700433 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5700434 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5700435 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5700436 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5700437 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5700438 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5700439 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5700440 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5700441 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5700442 who are open to doing something on the production side
5700443 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5700444 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5700445 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5700446 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5700447 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5700448 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5700449 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5700450 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5700451 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5700452 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5700453 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5700454 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5700455 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5700456 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5700457 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5700458 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5700459 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5700460 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5700461 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5700462 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5700463 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5700464 this is about as joyful as it gets live national tv i love it i cant wait
5700465 while im doing the show i just feel like im being myself
5700466 but after the show when im left alone in my dressing room ill see the hot topics segment and ill feel the magic im thinking this is pretty funny oprah didnt do that ellen didnt do that im really enjoying it
5700467 por supuesto los rusos y venezolanos pueden tener toda la cooperaci n que quieran pero es curioso
5700468 ch vez podr a concentrarse m s en los problemas del pueblo de venezuela m s que en invitar a la flota a hacer una escala
5700469 no estoy seguro de lo que venezuela necesite o vaya a ganar con una visita de la flota rusa

5700471 love competition love risking your pride love sport even when it breaks your heart
5700472 we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5700473 i feel greatly sorry there are so many people who worry about me take care of me care about me and support me honestly i could do nothing
5700474 i dont know why this happened and this is not what i wanted to see really it the pain was intolerable if i withstood it the pain my hamstring really would not have been able to cope no matter how much i wanted it to
5700475 i have to be optimistic not blaming anyone keeping up my spirit i will never easily give up this is my character i will make them see
5700476 how perfect would that be to beat the dream team then go into the medal rounds
5700477 i just want to enjoy this last one and see what happens of course i dont want it to end tomorrow we came here to get a medal and we still plan to
5700478 its a massive game because of the team we are coming up against but its also a quarter final in the olympic games and we want to get to the medal rounds and the only way to do that is to beat the usa
5700479 if im going to tell you the truth of course its not ideal to play them now and id be silly to say it is
5700480 i believe the form we have right now were at the peak of what we can give when do you want to play them at your peak and thats where we are were right where we need to be and this is our time
5700481 underdog status thats exactly where australians belong its the best way to be
5700482 weve got a crack at one of the biggest upsets in australian sporting history and what a stage to do it on
5700483 we realise whats in front of us and we all know what is there to be had
5700484 it would be silly to say were going to stop kobe bryant more than lebron james they have so many weapons and its more about taking away their style of play and making it work the way we want it to
5700485 its the olympics its the usa its further than ive ever been as a coach at the olympics its the big stage but i cant be looking at those things
5700486 i have to try to keep away from the emotion of it the big thing is making sure the guys think it can happen and while i know its easy to say that and talk it up i honestly believe they do think that way
5700487 im really proud of the way they have played so far but the reality is we are going to have to play as well as any team ive ever coached to win this one the us have been making good teams very good teams look very ordinary
5700488 australia always plays a completely different style of game than we played against germany which they won by 49 points
5700489 they run a continuity offence and they are very proficient at it and they run hard cuts and set hard picks
5700490 quiero que me manden tropas para estos sectores latifundistas que se niegan a cumplir con la ley las leyes son las leyes

5700492 es la mitad de lo que pretend a el holding de la familia rocca
5700493 es el doble de lo que el presidente venezolano quer a pagar por la estatizaci n de la principal sider rgica de ese pa s
5700494 el ministro de industrias b sicas y miner a rodolfo sanz hace mes y medio cort la comunicaci n con nosotros sobre la nacionalizaci n de sidor
5700495 lo primero que har una empresa del estado socialista es reestablecer las relaciones entre los trabajadores y la empresa ser nuestra prioridad
5700496 tenemos una diferencia muy grande entre nuestros c lculos auditados y lo que pretend a la empresa entonces a partir de este momento se activa un decreto de expropiaci n que firmar el presidente
5700497 a n no sabemos de d nde vamos a sacar los recursos pero s los tenemos
5700498 dando estricto cumplimiento al ordenamiento jur dico de la rep blica bolivariana de venezuela y lo establecido en el decreto 6091 se firm un memorando de entendimiento que es un paso m s en el proceso de nacionalizaci n iniciado hace 60 d as el 18 de junio estamos contentos de llegar a un acuerdo seguiremos trabajando el proceso no se ha cerrado al decidir que nos quedamos en una sociedad estamos mostrando el inter s de que siga creciendo el mercado de la construcci n en venezuela

5700502 he notado una suerte de inter s y de planteamiento de ignorar a venezuela y de que es posible una iniciativa energ tica hemisf rica sin tomarnos en cuenta
5700503 algunos hablan de una nueva alianza en materia de energ a en am rica latina con pa ses como m xico o brasil
5700504 con esa diferencia no hay nada que discutir porque la fortaleza la tiene venezuela
5700505 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5700506 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5700507 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5700508 people shouldnt have to trick or treat throughout the organization for information
5700509 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5700510 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5700511 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5700512 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5700513 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5700514 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5700515 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5700516 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5700517 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5700518 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5700519 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5700520 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5700521 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5700522 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5700523 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5700524 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5700525 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5700526 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5700527 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5700528 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5700529 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5700530 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5700531 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5700532 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5700533 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5700534 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5700535 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5700536 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5700537 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5700538 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5700539 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5700540 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5700541 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5700542 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5700543 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5700544 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5700545 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5700546 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5700547 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5700548 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5700554 at this years hupo world congress in amsterdam bruker daltonics is continuing its history of market leading innovations and is proudly releasing the maxis an instrument with unprecedented simultaneous high speed and ultra high resolution performance across a broad mass range

5700557 beyond the superior financial returns the internet increases public access to public goods our shoppers finish dinner get the kids ready for bed and then bid on a police auction
5700558 reckless people have deluded themselves that this was a subprime crisis but we have problems with credit card debt student loan debt auto loans commercial real estate loans home equity loans corporate debt and loans that financed leveraged buyouts
5700559 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5700560 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5700561 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5700562 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5700563 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5700564 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5700807 derecho a un nombre y a una nacionalidad de ni os ni as y adolescentes
5700808 lo primero es estar conscientes de qui n soy de d nde pertenezco y a estar orgullosos de nuestra identidad eso s es tener autonom a en esta zona sin partida de nacimiento somos invisibles no existimos en el municipio y dependiendo de la cantidad de personas en la localidad as se destinan los fondos a las municipalidades para las acciones sociales

5700989 i thought what have i taken i spoke to my doctor and he said they were strong water tablets so i should be ok and i spoke to the pharmacy and he said that i should be all right and bring them in and he would swap them
5700990 i was worried all that night and i didnt sleep
5700991 it could have been something more serious and it could have been given to a child

5701002 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5701003 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5701004 all the evidence so far indicates that these qualitative differences in nutrition are causal in determining caste though were missing the final link in order to determine if it was casual
5701005 there are some cases where nature completely wins out but all of this is telling us theres a nice interaction between nature and nurture across most social insects
5701006 the benefit to the colony in having the nurture part is that it allows flexibility
5701007 they can quickly and easily change what caste theyre producing to fit their environment better but having the nature component benefits the individual because it can bias its development toward becoming reproductive its a balance between what the individual wants versus what the colony wants

5701039 i dont believe senator hillary clinton is asking anyone to vote for her
5701040 its not the partys business to tell the delegates how to cast their votes
5701041 we believe that the delegates will follow her directive to support senator obama for president but it hasnt been decided how everything is going to happen

5701137 lo sustantivo es que podemos datar cronol gicamente las primeras escrituras de saramago hasta el momento en el a o 1944 cosa que se desconoc a porque se situaban en el a o 1947 que es cuando publica su primera novela
5701138 que podemos decir que su acceso a la literatura es a trav s de la poes a que luego escribe novela que adem s escribe teatro cosa que es in dita
5701139 vuelve otra vez en el a o 1966 y despu s de dejar de escribir a entrar por la v a de la poes a en la literatura cosa que no es accesoria en un escritor cuyas ltimas obras han crecido en intensidad l rica a lo largo de los a os y donde l ha dicho que se encuentra su mejor poes a

5701152 door blessures speelden we op het middenveld met drie nummer 10s en dat wreekt zich op je spel er heerst ontgoocheling maar ik besef dat we verdiend verloren hebben de volgende wedstrijd voor het brons tegen brazili of argentini zal niet makkelijk worden maar we moeten ons toch proberen op te laden
5701153 we hadden veel moeite met de kracht en de snelheid van onze tegenstander tijdens het tweede half uur waren we beter in de wedstrijd en hadden we moeten scoren toen de 2 0 viel kregen we een tik al heeft niemand de armen laten zakken en zijn we blijven voetballen de tegenstander was echter te sterk
5701154 in zon match moet elke halve kans binnen onze effici ntie was te zwak om onze droom waar te maken ik ben niet verrast door deze nigerianen want twee jaar geleden speelden ze al een finale tegen brazili
5701155 vergeet niet dat we tegen itali lang met tien man gespeeld hebben dat heeft veel energie gekost en bovendien hebben we maar 13 veldspelers meer over we moeten echter nieuwe motivatie vinden en blijven geloven in onze eigen kansen want een medaille zit er nog steeds in de komende drie dagen zullen we er alles aan doen om klaar te zijn
5701156 een groot verlies voor het afrikaanse continent en de democratie
5701157 er bestaat in ons land geen instituut voor ongevalanalyse die de werkelijke oorzaken van ongevallen moet onderzoeken zo zijn bij bijna 50 procent van alle ongevallen op de autosnelwegen vrachtwagens betrokken en die mogen amper 90 km u rijden van die camions zijn er nog vier op tien ingeschreven in het buitenland die niet weten dat men hier bij regenweer niet mag voorbijsteken
5701158 schouppe echter om de boetes te doen met nieuwe flitspalen op de autosnelwegen wil hij het gat in de schatkist vullen
5701159 schouppe zou beter zijn energie steken in het oplossen van het fileprobleem het gevaar bij wegeniswerken de slechte staat van onze autostrades

5701165 dan moeten de oorzaken gedefinieerd worden zijn dit effectief factoren die te maken met vrouwonvriendelijkheid en lijden de vrouwen effectief aan minority stress pas dan kan gezocht worden naar maatregelen om meer vrouwen naar de centra te leiden om daar de noodzakelijke op maat gesneden gespecialiseerde zorg en hulpverlening te vinden
5701166 ik denk dat we nog meer inspanningen moeten leveren om de drempel te verlagen voor alleenstaande ouders met kinderen maar dit geldt voor alle soorten hulpverlening en ook voor alleenstaande vaders
5701167 we waren echt gemotiveerd om te presteren en zijn dan ook zeer tevreden met dit resultaat onze tegenstander zag er wat vermoeid uit en de afrikaanse weersomstandigheden speelden duidelijk in ons voordeel het is geweldig om nu al zeker te zijn van een medaille hopelijk wordt het goud want daar is mijn land op deze spelen nog niet in geslaagd
5701168 je gebroed die boosaardige feeks van een angelina en haar leeghoofdig lief brad pitt verdienen ongeveer 40 miljoen dollar per jaar in gewelddadige psychopatische films en daarvan geven ze drie miljoen aan kinderen die honger lijden zo wekken ze de indruk dat ze om de wereld geven maar ondertussen spuwen ze stommeklootjes uit die meer zullen consumeren dan hen toekomt en de wereld nog meer om zeep zullen helpen
5701169 maar juffrouw jolie zegt dat ze ook mccain aardig vindt en heeft nog niet besloten wie ze gaat steunen word je dan niet verondersteld een beetje hersenen te hebben en te weten dat de afrikaanse dochter waarmee je zo graag op fotos staat ouders had die hebben geleden onder de wereldwijde aanval op afrika die sinds reagan door de republikeinen werd georchestreerd ook je zonen zijn slachtoffers van het rechtse militaire amerika het zou de eigenwaarde van je aziatische en afrikaanse kinderen misschien ten goede komen mochten ze weten dat je obama steunt als leider van de vrije wereld
5701170 het is duidelijk dat we heel wat kracht hebben ingeboet door het vertrek van kompany en fellaini
5701171 jammer dat die jongens naar huis moesten al begrijp ik de clubs ook wel bovendien misten we ook de geschorste vermaelen waardoor wel bijna elk duel verloren ook onze bank was veel te smal door al die heisa
5701172 je kan een match verliezen maar niet op deze manier we hebben bailly meermaals in de steek gelaten ik begrijp dat hij heel boos is ik ga er nu nog even niet aan denken maar we moeten ons opladen voor die laatste match vrijdag dit was een uitgelezen kans om een medaille te pakken maar we moeten nu voluit voor brons gaan
5701173 intellectuals we have to conclude are often fatally attracted to far out theories that tease the mind but that bear little relation to whats actually going on in the world
5701174 if you think as the atheists do that life arose spontaneously that we all evolved from a single source and there is no god then what real basis do you have for saying that its wrong to kill a human being but okay to kill a mouse or a fly
5701175 if you look at it from a biblical point of view you realize that life is a gift from god and that human beings are above the animals
5701176 things have changed so much in this country it used to be against the law in to teach the theory of evolution the scopes monkey trial dayton tenn 1925 is a good example of that but now its against the law to teach creation in public schools

5701180 passing bogus 20 bills onto small businesses is the best way a criminal can unload his counterfeit money
5701181 most small business people arent suspicious and theyre not trained to spot the bogus bills
5701182 this is one of the largest if not the largest counterfeit currency rings we have seen in southern california
5701183 through fine investigative work the secret service was able to uncover the perpetrators before even more honest businesses were defrauded by the passing of counterfeit money counterfeiting is a very serious crime as it damages our national monetary system facilitates a host of other crimes and has the potential to compromise our national security
5701184 this case illustrates the merging of traditional crimes such as counterfeiting with advanced technologies that criminals so often use to commit financial crimes today
5701185 through partnerships however law enforcement continues to stay ahead of criminals by combining police techniques with hi tech investigations

5701190 miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5701195 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5701196 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5701197 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
5701198 the home buying public is going to have to pay

5701204 and were running out my crew will kill for it refining it for smaller doses was the only way
5701205 weve had 20 years to research treatment to ease the symptoms
5701206 to ease them is that a joke have you ever seen a man who was forced by the alliance to submit to oxyriopine treatment hmm for the good of the alliance
5701207 that tapes do nothing to show the open sore the men ripped open with their own finger nail the itch is like a fucking torture

5701210 over the past five years weve donated nearly a quarter million dollars to childrens charities
5701211 when we started r2sl in 2004 we had no idea we would achieve this level of success were extremely grateful to every participant volunteer and sponsor who helped us reach this milestone
5701212 this was a great experience for all the different people from different avenues
5701213 for my first time on this track it was awesome a great event for a great cause
5701214 i am already starting to tell my racers and customers about next years event
5701215 its a rare opportunity to have so much fun and support something good at the same time
5701216 we promote a culture of safety and smart riding and it shows in our safety record
5701217 wed like to thank our volunteer rider coaches from cornerspeed and team pro motion who helped riders of all levels experience the thrill of track riding
5701218 ah you must be ginkloo young one please come come
5701219 this is where you will sleep ginkloo every now and then an intercom comes on calling whoever to go to whatever doctor if you hear your name listen for the room number and then go to it i hope you enjoy your stay here we are only trying to help

5701225 the evidence against the terror suspects might be too slight
5701226 they had no time to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
5701227 with change in the air there is a sense that history might be on the side
5701228 had abandoned the government with the conviction that in waging the war against terrorism america had lost its way

5701234 proved to us our core technology it didnt prove we can scale it up to a commercial level thats what the next phase is for
5701235 my concern is that they arent recognizing how geographically compact the oil shale resource is there is this idea that theres 800 billion barrels of recoverable resource but about half of that is in the piceance basin
5701236 this is sort of frightening because you could really mess things up here you get the wrong people all of the sudden youre choking on the air quality in a class 1 pristine area
5701237 we actually have a philosophy that is relatively consistent with gov ritters and ken salazars
5701238 we want to make sure that our technology is prudently and cautiously developed and that it results in something that is economically viable environmentally responsible and socially sustainable
5701239 development of oil shale in colorado could significantly affect the councils ability to serve existing customers and the future growth projected for the front range of colorado
5701240 even though the benefits of oil shale are nationwide in terms of the impact on overall oil prices the environmental impacts of oil shale are almost 100 percent colorado
5701241 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5701242 its just going to be about knocking the rust off and get going i dont think it will take that long at all like riding a bike
5701243 you know how it is when you have to play you have to play
5701244 i told the trainers you are going to have to get me anti anxiety medication
5701245 i spent all offseason rehabbing both shoulders and the thumb and then my back gets hurt good night
5701246 just starting these two preseason games was huge for me i thought i did well
5701247 basically i just want to come in and help the offensive line any way i can
5701248 i want to be the guy we can depend on and just continue to work hard and practice hard
5701249 he seemed very upbeat about the situation you never want to see somebody get hurt but he said he was just going to take a little time off
5701250 right now they have me working at right tackle primarily and i feel comfortable there but whatever the team needs me to do i can do
5701251 being on that side is different and it has my balance off a little bit but it is much easier when you have a good player playing next to you somebody to lean on
5701252 there is some less experience with ray but ray is physical and he is very good at his technique he wont miss a beat
5701253 he didnt do much but its nice to have him back
5701254 it was kind of one of those things where mentally i had to push through it
5701255 after the first game it really settled in for me that i had to bear down and get things done with one arm
5701256 its obviously not an ideal situation to lose your first stringer and second stringer
5701257 i think we have worked hard in making it a non factor at least for me when i played in the minnesota game it was a non factor
5701258 i dont feel that im that far behind because ive been in the film room watching what hes teaching these guys
5701259 the film studying is really helping out a lot so its just all about knocking off the rust right now and getting going i dont think its going to take me long at all
5701260 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5701261 hes feeling pretty good he gave me the thumbs up today so if he doesnt do anything hell play
5701262 i feel worse than i did right after the game
5701263 we played a horribly sloppy game horribly sloppy we gained 500 yards against 200 yards and then overtime how does that compute well it computes because we had six turnovers 12 penalties a couple blocked punts it was horrible and i wont stand for it from the coaches or the players weve got to get cranking it was too much playground the other night
5701264 right after the game i was not happy with charlie
5701265 then i looked at the film and charlie got hit a lot in that game and that coupled with the fact that its his first start for us and theres a lot of new stuff weve thrown at him
5701266 charlie is a tough guy and theres some things there that he cant do and he probably wont do them again and hell learn from that but i was actually proud of the fact that he hung in there because he got hit too much in the game i was not happy about that
5701267 last week the government accountability office released a report that revealed why washington is so broken democratic politicians too often act like u s businesses are the enemy

5701365 sebagian besar museum memang mati akar persoalannya pada kurangnya dana pengelolaan ini terjadi karena museum masih ditempatkan masyarakat sebagai tempat untuk menyimpan benda benda kuno
5701366 karena memang tidak ada lagi sumber air yang dapat diandalkan maka pada musim kemarau seperti sekarang kami terpaksa bolak balik mengambil air dari kali sembir
5701367 sebelumnya air dari kali sembir dapat tersalur dan dinikmati langsung di rumah rumah penduduk namun karena instalasi pipa yang dipasang rusak maka selama lima tahun terakhir ini kami terpaksa harus mengambil air dengan cara mengangsu
5701368 siang hari diatas jam tersebut kami sulit untuk mendapatkan air karena debit air sudah sangat kecil
5701369 di dua sumber air lainnya debit air juga mengecil dan tidak mampu mencukupi kebutuhan warga oleh karena itu sekarang ini kami terpaksa meminta air dari dusun tetangga yaitu dusun butuh
5701370 kami juga resah kok bisa seperti itu apalagi sekarang di daftar calon sementara calon legislatif nama nama orang yang diduga bermasalah masih saja diajukan parpolnya
5701371 ya seperti itu lah politik ekonomi kita praktik praktik rente masih terjadi ketika misalnya sejumlah pejabat publik atau celakanya para pengusaha bermasalah mengalokasikan anggaran tertentu untuk para kroninya termasuk anggota legislatif tentu pihak yang diberi tadi merasa berkepentingan melindungi sumber sumber dana itu
5701372 namun memang pada tahap tertentu mereka juga butuh untuk menjadi populis akhirnya yang muncul kemudian adalah inkonsistensi penyikapan terhadap upaya pemberantasan korupsi
5701373 the philips device indicated that the channels were already occupied prior to the mics being turned on so there was not much new information turning on the mics essentially made no change in the display on the other hand the i2r devices initial sweep indicated that the channels were open then when the mics were turned on it would not detect them in almost all test locations both devices showed no change between the mics being on or off
5701374 the devices failed to sense and detect the presence of wireless microphones and that is what the test is about
5701375 if you take a step back and look at this these devices have fairly poor batting averages
5701376 these devices are not anywhere close to where they need to be in order to work in our environment
5701377 the bottom line on this thing is that there was nothing unexpected from our perspective the philips device reached a decision in every case that wouldnt interfere with wireless mics and in no case did it say a channel was vacant when a device was on it
5701378 if that thing indicates that there is no available spectrum that would certainly protect the incumbents
5701379 but how useful will that be as a commercial device theres only one direction it can move in that area and that is to alter it in a way that it senses spectrum is available and thats where we expect big problems
5701380 we encourage the fcc to conduct thorough testing of tvws tv white spaces prototypes on as expedited a schedule as possible
5701381 we look forward to fcc decisions within the next 90 days to promulgate rules to open the white space spectrum and provide adequate protection to existing users
5701382 saya tidak akan pergi karena tetap di sini saya memainkan peran baru seperti dulu dan setiap orang di tim ini selalu tumbuh bersama kekuatan lini tengah kami semakin baik dan saya belajar untuk berlain lebih cepat sehingga mudah membuat keputusan untuk bermain
5701383 i wanted to know that i would have the ability to call the shots
5701384 spectrum is very valuable and we want to make sure its being used as efficiently as possible
5701385 the idea of trying to utilize the white spaces from a consumer perspective would be a good win for everyone
5701386 i like to think of it as wi fi on steroids
5701387 we have medical devices laptops even toys that are starting to incorporate bluetooth we want the wireless revolution to continue but the little spectrum we have wont get us there
5701388 the only way we operate as a business is if our viewers get a clear tv picture given the fact that theres been a series of failures in testing at the fcc it doesnt give us a lot of comfort
5701389 lets not make the quiet period confusing or disruptive to the viewer
5701390 whats dec 15 have to do with the dtv transition nothing
5701391 we are now in the process of reviewing the records and considering the test results that were submitted by t mobile to determine whether any adjustments need to be made to the proposal as other commissioners review it
5701392 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction
5701393 at a time when the commission and congress have expressed concern about industry consolidation in the wake of the 700mhz auction
5701394 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
5701395 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
5701396 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
5701397 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
5701398 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay
5701399 to have any relevance they have to stick to this
5701400 this isnt rejecting cookies outright you are just preferring not to see the ads
5701401 if youre a comcast customer and you buy a package of content from us you should be able to consume and manage that content across screens
5701402 we very much believe that the internet and the pc should be a tool to manage and consume that content
5701403 one of the luxuries we have as part of comcast is the scale to pursue our huge ambitions for cim
5701404 we want to capture a share of what everybody believes will be an increasingly ad supported revenue stream online
5701405 were providing the ecosystem to have a low friction way of moving from the content owners and the distributors
5701406 not only is it the right strategy its the essential strategy
5701407 consumers are showing companies what needs to be done by shifting their consumption away from linear video any company that doesnt give customers what theyre looking for is going to be disadvantaged
5701408 are worried that if they give you online video youll drop your premium cable subscription
5701409 theyre right in that fear by the way but only comcast seems to have the money and the commitment to getting there first rather than watching someone else come in and walk away with their business
5701410 proven track record of developing and growing multiple online entertainment businesses
5701411 but by stitching the windows together in that fashion we believe that consumers will get an on demand experience when they want it where they want it
5701412 what youll see over the next 12 months is if what youre looking for is online but you want to watch it on your living room tv well be able to say heres how you get it from the internet to the television
5701413 we think consumers really are going to respond to what we can offer
5701414 we have 30 year relationships with these content guys its a synergistic relationship with them theres no reason why that relationship shouldnt extend online
5701415 fancast reinforces linear by helping people find new and complementary content
5701416 i think its nothing but good news for us to figure out ways of working with comcast and other distributors to extend to as many platforms and as many devices as possible
5701417 they can experiment and they can come in later and buy and integrate if they need to take advantage of a market trend
5701418 any voluntary quiet period that does not begin before the agreements actually expire or which is too brief to preclude potentially confusing messages about broadcast carriage during the time of the actual dtv transition represents the illusion of a commitment and does not serve the consumer
5701419 while we appreciate those nab members willingness to embrace a retransmission consent quiet period a start date of feb 4 2009 is simply too late and will not go far enough to protect consumers whose signals could be pulled by broadcasters before feb 4
5701420 were focused on the dtv transition theyre focused on retransmission consent those are two very different sets of business issues
5701421 thats a business decision between the cable company or satellite provider and the local broadcaster
5701422 i dont want to speak on his behalf but martin seemed fine with it
5701423 he said his dates had just been kind of floating around in his mind there was nothing magic about his dates
5701424 he is open to options but he has not made a decision on this one
5701425 many tv carriage contracts are coming up at the end of the year
5701426 i know fcc commissioner jonathan adelstein has supported the dec 15 date for the very reason the contracts would be expiring at the end of the year this would prevent any kind of ability of broadcasters to leverage that to the detriment of our members and certainly their customers
5701427 while we support a quiet period around the digital transition we strongly believe that all affected parties should be involved and reach a consensus on the parameters before moving forward
5701428 members of the fcc at various times have expressed an interest in obtaining the authority to regulate the content of cable television speech as well as broadcast television speech
5701429 the supreme court has already established a legal standard for indecent content on broadcast television a standard that is completely different from cable television
5701430 time warners brief is a solution desperately searching for a problem
5701431 youd have to live under a rock to not know

5701441 by every measure the u s is losing the international broadband race and our competitiveness as a nation is at stake
5701442 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally
5701443 at amp t and t mobile are now asking for a fifth test to be conducted on mobile to mobile interference
5701444 m2zs submission shows that the fcc record already contains the results of four independent tests on mobile to mobile interference that were conducted by verizon wireless avago alion ofcom and t mobile since this proceeding began
5701445 an indefinite testing regime on aws 3 spectrum will be a step backward for the fcc and the united states as a whole especially as it relates to other international regulators who have promoted new and efficient spectrum technologies and services in order to promote greater access to broadband
5701446 t he adjacent channel interference from tdd to standard fdd downlink is negligible for all scenarios
5701447 t he results of this further analysis on fdd tdd adjacent co existence confirm the substance of the conclusions that ofcom presented in the discussion document of august 2007 namely that the effects of terminal to terminal interference are very modest
5701448 if god exists why is there evil if god is all powerful why doesnt he stop bad things from happening

5701468 cu principiul egalitatii in fata legii si cu propunerile psd
5701469 dupa ce ai votat cum ai votat este ridicol sa crezi ca vei fii credibil cu o astfel de propunere ridicarea totala a imunitatii este o prostie ceea ce se facuse pina acum era suficient daca nu intervenea curtea constitutionala psd incearca sa si acopere rahatul cu o asemenea propunere adica ii spalam pe ai nostri si pentru viitor mai vedem
5701470 aceasta initiativa este umbrita de un vot prin care psd a blocat aplicarea egala a legii pentru toata lumea revizuirea constitutiei nu poate fi o cirpeala facuta conjunctural ci doar urmarea unei analize de fond a unei intelegeri intre partidele politice
5701471 pnl are un proiect stralucit coerent care se concentreaza pe problemele principale ale constitutiei si rezolva chestiunea impartirii si a competentelor puterilor in stat
5701472 tema revizuirii constitutiei va fi una dintre temele de campanie
5701473 se va incerca folosirea ei dar nu va da rezultatele pe care sconteaza unii pentru ca este o tema pe termen lung abstracta

5701475 what we said earlier this year still applies now that there continues to be little transactional investment evidence in the general commercial and relevant to our specific industrial property markets
5701476 the apocalyptic opening lines of bob dylans all along the watchtower seem to capture the beleaguered mindset of the uk commercial real estate market
5701477 there is no real depth of evidence of willing buyers and sellers the rics valuation standards assumption financing remains difficult and sellers are reluctant to crystallise lower prices
5701478 if the thieves are the funded or equity based opportunist buyers and the jokers are the owners who wont sell there is no way out of this impasse yet

5701482 this is not a discussion about the rights of a woman to get an abortion the courts have long ago identified that right and continue to define its limits this regulation would not be aimed at changing or redefining any of that this is about the right of a doctor to not participate if he or she chooses for reasons they consider a matter of conscience

5701624 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
5701625 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
5701626 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

5701635 the council set some really good goals and if those goals are attained it will be fantastic
5701636 they painted several houses on the hilltop and we held a litter cleanup once a week while they were here they really looked forward to the litter cleanup because they could walk the streets on pleasant heights or labelle and talk to the residents they are looking forward to coming back next year

5701645 we the current leaders are getting older we have fought the civil rights fight and need to teach our young people about civil rights and the rights of all people
5701646 the civil rights movement started in the very early 1960s but this is a different moment this is a different era we are living in dr martin luther king did his work which was commissioned by god for his time we need to keep the movement going because the civil rights struggle will always continue
5701647 our children must become involved and gain the knowledge as to what education can do for us in a non violent way of life
5701648 we have been going throughout the community with a video camera asking people for their views on the civil rights movement a lot of young people today arent familiar with the history of the civil rights movement and that is something we hope to work on through education no one is perfect and this is an opportunity to stand up and get right
5701649 young people are being murdered or going to prison but we believe every young person deserves a chance there is hope with the ohio valley black caucus there is hope to achieve our goals
5701650 the junior black caucus represents young people from the age of 10 to 18 years old

5701653 we are a great people with a great history and our youth need to know their history

5701671 i eventually got a place to turn and headed back up to the flat part on top of the mountain because i felt that was the safest place to be
5701672 i rang 999 and got the fire service they told me they would come for me
5701673 but they told me that the sligo mountain rescue team was on the way
5701674 the fire brigade rang me fairly regularly to let me know what was happening and to check that i was ok
5701675 i was very glad to see their lights coming i felt that i was safe where i was but as time drags on your mind begins to work overtime and fears began to creep in that there could be a slide even where i was

5701692 assembly republicans on sunday blocked a proposed spending plan that would have closed the states 15 2 billion shortfall with the help of tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations
5701693 the failure of the democratic plan means the state will continue to operate with no budget more than a month and a half into the fiscal year heightening uncertainty for schools healthcare providers and other services
5701694 the move by gop lawmakers came as little surprise on the assembly floor since republicans have long said they would vote against the tax proposal
5701695 the assembly heard nearly four hours of debate during which 49 members spoke in the end the plan garnered a 45 to 30 plurality but fell short of the 54 votes or two thirds majority it needed no republican voted for it
5701696 the bottom line is we cannot solve a 15 billion deficit without new revenue said assembly speaker

5701729 how often do you use a computer in your lessons
5701730 how do pupils use ict to gather information in your lessons
5701731 we didnt know that he was abnormal we just thought he was docile
5701732 my memories are of him being alone being isolated and being pretty miserable
5701733 i recall the pain of his shyness he would break out in a sweat and freeze with palpable pain at having to respond
5701734 he really went out of his way to make sure that no one could interact with him he would keep his head down and walk straight to his seat he was the most anti social person i have ever met
5701735 in one class he refused to give his name and introduced himself as question mark
5701736 i have no recollection of ever seeing anyone attack him either verbally or physically
5701737 children with selective mutism have problems socially and emotionally if left untreated this completely affects their self worth
5701738 with many sufferers as they get older the social anxiety starts to go away but their conditioned and reinforced mute behaviour persists
5701739 by the time he came to me aged 13 its difficult this is not only an anxiety disorder a whole lifestyle has been organised around it and it is hard to change
5701740 he would speak and he could speak very eloquently if he wanted to
5701741 he could also be very silent when he wanted to and he seemed to use that silence in much the same way as he used his sunglasses and his hat both as a way of hiding behind this persona hed built but also as a way of intimidation of making sure that you knew that there were things about him you couldnt know
5701742 these are the injustices he is up against and even if he wins someone takes it away theres a great desire for vengeance
5701743 the more specific a fantasy the more dangerous it is there are destructive fantasies in all of the writings wanting to destroy others and self destruction
5701744 he knew he could not succeed so he said ok how can i leave a mark in a way which no one can take away from me how do you do it in a way which will grab the worlds attention
5701745 he was moving away from the role of victim and donning this persona where aggression towards himself and aggression towards the world come together for this final act of revenge

5701747 we were shooting a video and we had on victorias secret pink lingerie thongs and black stiletto heels

5701749 i want people all over the world to look at jamaican women in a different light
5701750 thats why i decided to no longer go by my birth name shauna which means pretty and instead go by which means strong in swahili women have so much power and strength and they need to realise that
5701751 times are changing now women are getting their fair time on stage theyre getting featured properly on the flyers for shows things are getting better and those are the standards that i set for myself
5701752 i find that really stupid because singing is a sound and not a look
5701753 and i dont believe that its the public who are crying out for sex symbols in the music industry ive never heard of any consumer going into a record shop and asking for a record by the sexiest artist the record shop has
5701754 there are many female artists who have enjoyed success through positive lyrics and without taking their clothes off tracy chapman did it alanis morisette did it and there are others just like them
5701755 i always had a mindset in terms of what i wanted to achieve and i knew that it would come with obstacles
5701756 when i released daddy there was initially a nonchalant approach from some people when it came to promoting it it was only the more radical djs who acknowledged that it was a hit who played it and then the public backed it it would seem that its easier for female artists to take their clothes off in order to gain success but my think is about morals
5701757 i think its also about what you want from the business whether youre doing it for love or money im in this business for the love of music and a desire to spread conscious messages and messages of truth and what is right
5701758 they do that all the time but im above that
5701759 i think some men are jealous of the progression of women in the business but times are changing
5701760 i work with fifth element one of the top roots record companies in jamaica

5701780 i was told at one point that they christmas albums didnt make any money but thats not the point at all
5701781 it was just so grossly remiss that i have not had a christmas album it was just ridiculous
5701782 id be at home cooking and enjoying the holidays and listening to everybody but myself i wasnt enjoying that
5701783 i think people who are depressed especially those on anti depressants should be aware of this if they are driving or doing anything that relies on concentration and reaction skills
5701784 assessments are done on a case by case basis we would urge anyone who feels their driving is impaired by a medical condition to contact us
5701785 depression can affect people in many different ways but one of the common symptoms is experiencing difficulty concentrating
5701786 however its important to state that everyone has highs and lows in concentration and reaction times and a period of depression doesnt mean that youre a danger on the roads
5701787 in principle i consider that the proposed development if permitted would have a positive influence on both the visual and residential amenity of the area

5701789 whosoever says that muhammad saw concealed something which he was commanded to communicate is is a great calumny against allah
5701790 if the messenger of allah saw had concealed something which he was commanded to communicate he would have concealed the saying of the almighty behold thou didst say to one who had received the grace of allah and thy favour keep your wife to yourself and fear allah
5701791 o messenger of allah which of us did not involve his faith with obscurity

5701796 i read the book of allah from beginning to its end
5701797 if you have read it you would have found it as for your reading what the messenger teaches you take it and what he forbids you avoid doing it
5701798 i have heard the messenger of allah saw say may allahs curse be on the al namisat

5701804 commenting on mr parkers departure mike tuffrey the leader of the liberal democrat group in the london assembly said
5701805 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5701806 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5701807 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5701808 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5701809 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5701810 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5701811 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

5701815 for everything too human does well it feels as if there is something holding it back the character customization options and great class and skill system are the kind of foundation games should be built on but then its all made rather moot by the fact that dying doesnt matter and all of the enemies scale to you the sense of accomplishment just isnt there if youre the kind of gamer that loves outfitting a character and scouring the land for that one epic loot drop too human will excite you and then some for the rest of us its a decent game that will entertain you until the next big release comes along

5701817 lo siguiente que not fue que mis instrumentos midiendo los niveles de contaminaci n en diferentes ciudades del mundo todos registraron un decremento de precisamente 4 675 porciento eran 20 ciudades distintas y todas experimentaron precisamente el mismo decremento y esto fue confirmado independientemente por cinco laboratorios distintos en el mundo as de la nada las condiciones ambientales en estas ciudades mejoraron sin ninguna raz n aparentemente

5701865 its hard in this league to consistently pound and pound the ball
5701866 everybody says well some teams run this not like we run it
5701867 its no huddle fast paced fast tempo involve your quarterback in running the football spread the field use a lot of wide receivers
5701868 we play extremely fast theres a lot of people that do no huddle but most people that do no huddle dont try to play the tempo that we played on at troy the last two seasons we are fast no huddle
5701869 were going to have a few playmakers were going to need more and more of them to step up as we go along
5701870 we have a lot of athletes on our offensive side of the ball
5701871 we have some great athletes that can work in space and we have some great receivers that can run great routes and great running backs that can run in the hole and come out of the backfield and catch some balls too
5701872 weve got to be able to score from a distance and not have everything be like pulling teeth to get the ball across the goal line
5701873 it is nice for practice but you worry about september when its going to be 100 degrees and humid
5701874 we need more heat and humidity and need to work a little harder
5701875 it was good getting in and having the time this morning with the players to go over the video of the scrimmage
5701876 we did a lot of good things we made a lot of good individual plays and we just need to get better as a unit as an offense and defense the way you do that is all 11 guys do their job on a given play and with great effort
5701877 i think that we threw and caught the ball well
5701878 we were accurate throwing the ball and we didnt have drops we made catches and made plays thats something that we keep talking to them about is the consistency and how contagious that can be
5701879 we just need to have our poise and keep working hard
5701880 keep believing in what we are doing and you know eventually all 11 guys will do their job at the same time and well be good on defense we just need to keep improving
5701881 one thing about the defensive line is that scrimmages are probably hardest on them than anybody else what you would like to do is have eight guys that you can rotate in and keep fresh when you go one and twos you have to go every rep so its a little bit more difficult for them

5701898 and one of the biggest questions for me was do you have a program for young teachers
5701899 research shows that a number of excellent teachers leave the field in their first five years
5701900 there are many reasons for this but one significant one is the lack of support they feel
5701901 our program provides the necessary information and support about the dis trict its procedures and programs
5701902 being a first year mentor is like being a first year teacher
5701903 it takes a whole year just to learn the program
5701904 the first year for any teacher is always the tough est

5701978 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go

5701980 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
5701981 the problem with the supply side of the equation is a problem of accessing the resources in the ground so they can be explored and developed
5701982 its amazing the difference from the 1970s where a lot of money went into exploration development and production of new resources
5701983 it is happening a little bit now but it is not going to be enough
5701984 we are going to depend on the venezuelan the nigerian or the iranian oil companies for the future of our oil supplies

5701992 weve been at the tail end of the dog for a long time
5701993 were finally coming back around to ideas that were around before the corporate franchise was shown to be a failure
5701994 so much money was being spent to push the corporate model that it was all cities heard about there was no pr or marketing for community wireless groups but unlike the corporations their focus has always been maximizing the public good
5701995 i firmly believe that every public access tv operation every community radio station every nonprofit community technology center can be doing this
5701996 its not rocket science all of those technology based nonprofits are strapped for revenue weve got to figure out a way to capture some of those digital dollars that are falling out of our communities and this is it
5701997 having the city itself as the anchor tenant gives the provider an incentive to set up a good network
5701998 from the get go theres a set amount of money philadelphia never had that deal san francisco never had that deal
5701999 if a private company decides they just arent going to do it anymore the community is stuck because its privately owned
5702000 if its publicly owned and the network is not going exactly as planned they can decide if its still worth it for their police officers to have access if its still worth it to have inspectors and social workers be able to enter their data remotely if its still worth it for citizens to be able to connect anywhere they can ask those questions and decide whether its good for the community or not
5702001 u s internet is not investing in a mobile handset project and trying to still provide dsl service and outsourcing their customer service to india this is their main project

5702003 you can already have an advantage in terms of pricing it more reasonably to make sure your businesses and your people can afford to have fast connectivity thats going to keep the city competitive regionally and globally
5702004 universal affordable access for broadband technology by the year 2007
5702005 we have a failure on the national level thats too important to ignore
5702006 not to view broadband as a strategic asset is a significant shortcoming the other leading countries of the world do view broadband in that light and they are thinking about how to get more of it at much faster speeds and lower rates because its a platform for so many other things that are important
5702007 is make sure that communities that want to solve their own problems that want to build the network they need can do that
5702008 if we open up the unused spaces between the television channels it suddenly becomes possible to deploy the network that we need at a quarter of the cost
5702009 as president i will set a simple goal every american should have the highest speed broadband access no matter where you live or how much money you have well connect schools libraries and hospitals and well take on special interests to unleash the power of wireless spectrum for our safety and connectivity
5702010 we need to start looking at this as an infrastructure issue rather than as a business
5702011 we dont ask cities and towns to cost justify bringing in fresh water and having a sewer system when we could outsource it to private companies nobody says why should my town compete with the private water market i can get perrier why should i have water we treat water as a utility we do the same thing with electricity we have to take the same attitude here toward broadband
5702012 matts a wrestler he might want to come out and trade punches with me but im assuming at some point in the fight hes gonna try taking me down
5702013 im comfortable for it to go to ground im not worried about ending up on my back

5702017 we did a lot of valuable training at home station

5702020 they have set the standard by which those who follow will be measured
5702021 its not about the number of hours flown or the ordnance weve expended its about the support weve provided to the soldier on the ground
5702022 to any attack reconnaissance battalion the ultimate accolade you can achieve is the respect of the ground commanders that you support
5702023 as i told you im going to give you some brochures
5702024 its only 5 000 but its a start and i appreciate your help
5702025 well theyve got a big house on top of the hill
5702026 the patients were on life support and they had their critical care teams with them
5702027 we figured out the logistics of how we were going to get them from one plane to the other as quickly as possible but with the least amount of movement
5702028 i worked in balad in 2004 at the casf and we always got our patients out of the theater hospital there loaded them on the bus and transported them to the aircraft this was different
5702029 here in this facility were seeing patients mostly after theyve been seen the bleedings been stopped patched up and bandaged
5702030 it isnt like being in balad where injuries are coming in left and right straight off the battlefield so that was something that we got to see firsthand and it was a great experience
5702031 we bring them in and make sure theyre comfortable while theyre here and get them back out so they can receive further care
5702032 we have an anti hijacking room where patients get checked to ensure they dont have any knives razor blades or weapons in their possession and their bags get scanned through an x ray machine
5702033 afterward we brief them on the different things we can offer at the facility and take them to their beds where theyll talk to a nurse about their current condition and any problems they may be having with pain
5702034 its crazy this man rangel controls tax policy in the united states hes a lot bigger than just a regular member of congress he deserves more respect than this
5702035 basically they have told us they cant help us that there are too many obama supporters ahead of charlie on the line
5702036 all i kept thinking was that ill bet my father never saw anything like this in his entire life and that i couldnt believe i was seeing this myself i thought or even said out loud that all this would still be right here looking exactly the same even if i hadnt come id be missing it and never even know it existed then i wondered what else am i missing well that lasted about one second because i realized if theres anything more perfect out there than this well i just dont want to know about it
5702037 it was there then and its there now but i get to keep that one private night all to myself i still carry it around with me everywhere i go nothing else like it i turned off the headlights at three in the morning at sixty miles an hour you could do that and still see perfectly the moon was so bright roads were a lot rougher then than now but that didnt seem to matter the wind was blowing in my face making me feel drunker than any beer or whiskey ever had then i pulled over shut off the engine and lay back against the windshield on top of the hood and just listened to the desert you know what i heard nothing it was the deepest thickest silence you can imagine i thought it was quiet out on my dads old farm thirty years ago on a summers night when everyone had gone to sleep and i climbed up onto the top of a haystack to lie back and look at the stars it was like new york city at rush hour in comparison to that 1937 arizona night and they couldve put a picture of that sky in the dictionary beside the word clear
5702038 why do we work in coal mines in the fields in filthy factories killing ourselves day by day and for nothing more than a bite of food while digging our way deeper into debt at least out west if youre in debt you have something to show for it and if youre broke at least you still get to be warm most of the time
5702039 or maybe hell own an even bigger place when his wife and kids come along theyll be safe and warm and clean and well fed
5702040 if something is unfair shut the hell up and change it
5702041 some of us farm boys would be stuck eight or ten miles out of town for weeks at a time sometimes months maybe all summer long with no one but the old farm hands and ourselves to talk to pretty soon you start thinking the whole world is just like you because most of the time you are your whole world the boy in the grocery store well hed already learned how to make small talk hed spent his life observing who was getting ahead in life and who wasnt and why it mustve just seemed natural for him to incorporate the best of everything into one big ball inside his brain and let it roll he mentioned his best friend parked cars at night at some fancy restaurant and spent his days in the sun on the beach or reading books if it rained can you believe that i couldnt my god a luxury like that was unheard of in our family free time the only night job within fifty miles of home was to be elected sheriff and everyone felt sorry for the poor guy drinking coffee and eating donuts and having to drive around all night long the way he did but here was this california kid a 19 year old young fellow making 8 or 9 a day with no overhead no mortgage no tools to buy no kids to feed no wood to chop no coal to haul no water to carry no dust or straw to wheeze in if he couldnt make the rent he could just sleep on the beach i guess he and his friends wore clothes that actually fit we took whatever we could get and it usually wasnt a pretty sight we left school often before graduation got jobs got married and had a bunch of kids a piece of america the things we thought of as good values i told the young man in the store about all that and he looked amused he asked why i told him that back home the question would be why not anything seemed possible in california somehow you could do or think or say anything anything goes should be the state slogan
5702042 i always read the comics when i could find a newspaper then i found out that those guys who drew them earned more money in a month than my dad did in a year of backbreaking farm work yet when some wild eyed kid back home said he was leaving to seek his fortune the old guys would laugh and tell him things are tough all over hed come crawling back soon and hed learn his lesson the hard way you cant run away from your problems theyd say well it turned out that yes you could and a few of them did just that actually most of my friends who busted out werent so much running away from the bad stuff as running toward what looked like some pretty good stuff running away seems like some kid of blind mad dash with no particular destination in mind as long as its far from the starting place a few old buddies had very specific definite destinations in mind and a couple of them made out all right so far as i could tell from the letters they sent back until the letters finally just stopped coming
5702043 well this is home i was an outsider in california i fit in here

5702189 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5702190 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5702191 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5702192 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5702193 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5702194 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5702195 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5702196 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5702197 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5702198 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5702206 this would be a good opportunity for my brothers in laws to listen up to this speech by pm and get into action because most of the baby taking care work is done by my sisters and sisters in laws
5702207 a significant number is still very concerned about foreign talent or foreign workers competing with the locals particularly for jobs at the lower end so i think theres quite a lot of calls for the government to enforce stricter controls on employers with regards to hiring foreign workers especially those at the lower end

5702213 china has to be in the top four in the next olympics and then in the next thats the test

5702279 according to the authors humans handle over 100 million captchas every day this mental effort is precious they write since deciphering captchas requires people to perform a task that computers cannot their automated system attempts to harvest this precious effort scanned text is subjected to analysis by two optical character recognition programs in cases where the programs disagree the questionable word is converted into a captcha it along with a control word of known identity used for cases where a bot is trying to crack the captcha are then distributed to participating websites currently over 40 000 sites are using recaptcha the identification performed by each computer program is given a value of 0 5 points and each interpretation by a human is given a full point once a given identification hits 2 5 votes the word is considered called those words that are consistently given a single identity by human judges are recycled as control words

5702324 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5702325 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter
5702326 many of the internally displaced people who are yet to receive temporary shelter and are thus still living under trees are struggling to seek shelter from the rain
5702327 plans are under way to settle them in shelters located in safe areas prior to the commencement of the new school term there is absolutely no truth in the reports of internally displaced people living under trees

5702332 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
5702333 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
5702334 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
5702335 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
5702336 before solar installations were the exception and their absence was the rule
5702337 we want to get to the point where the opposite is the case
5702338 what they are doing in marburg is good and progressive and we and other cities need to move forward with similar initiatives as well

5702345 i have written a lot about corporate crime over the years and i used to say but i wont say it anymore that it is a misconception that white collar crime starts with the top level executive sitting and pointing at an underling and saying lets go break the law but boy was i wrong you look at these tapes its indisputable that that is exactly what was happening

5702360 the diversion costs can be staggering when the crew runs out of duty time so if they exceed their 8 hours of flying time that day for a two man crew or their 16 hour duty day faa regs the individual airlines may have contracts the bring that number down theyre pumpkins and then you have to find hotels and other means of transportation for the passengers ive been told it can cost 200 000 for a widebody to divert but the best case scenario land pick up fuel and depart immediately would easily cost 10 000 in extra fuel burned

5702410 your crystal ball is as big as ours in terms of when credit markets return to where they were when that policy was formed
5702411 when cdo products were offered it was an attractive investment security with a stable and attractive return and an independent aaa rating
5702412 however the us subprime crisis and the global credit crunch has resulted in many cdos being downgraded and caused substantial write downs for many global financial institutions and investors
5702413 the whole process i think was a little bit dodgy we are taking the blame for a lot of this where we basically invested under the state government guidelines
5702414 categorically we do not have direct exposure to subprime and thats both in our investment policies and procedures and our lending procedures
5702415 in fact we are in a very strong position in the market at the moment

5702439 it just sounded so fake and so contrived so i did a little research about it
5702440 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope

5702449 we have a prudential guidance operation in place much of it under the borrowing and investment power act
5702450 we have one organisation in victoria to my knowledge that has breached that act and thats the first mildura irrigation trust and we know how the government has responded to that a number of other bodies have prudential requirements under different acts of parliament and ive actually asked my department as i have on a number of occasions to actually report to me whether the modelling is appropriate and we obviously as a government are going to continue to adjust to what we need to do
5702451 invest victoria for example has confirmed to the department of treasury and finance that they dont hold any investments of the type described the age claimed invest victoria had 4 5 million invested
5702452 the metropolitan ambulance services has confirmed that they have no direct investment or exposure to the subprime market and again the mas sic said that they had 30 million
5702453 speaker the mav municipal association of victoria has issued a press release saying that the councils named are not exposed to the subprime issue
5702454 victorian local government has the strictest investment guidelines for councils across australia
5702455 none of the victorian councils mentioned in the story have invested in cdos and most do not even have funds under management by lehman brothers these are not denials they are facts
5702456 a lot has been made of the fall in the gold price over the last couple of weeks
5702457 we should bear in mind that us800 an ounce might sound a lot less than us900 an ounce but a year ago the gold price was us655 an ounce
5702458 we expect international prices for steel and steel making inputs to continue to be volatile but generally remain high by historical standards
5702459 strong demand for steel and steel making inputs is expected to underpin high prices
5702460 the strong performance is particularly pleasing given difficult market conditions
5702461 we havent disclosed how many bidders there are but it is a manageable number it is not 20 a handful would be appropriate to say
5702462 each has proposed a csg to lng project and we will work through those bidders
5702463 we are extremely pleased with this very strong result having traded well during what is considered to be the weakest retail climate for many years
5702464 it again shows the strength of our retail model while the retail outlook is less certain than at previous reporting dates jb has proven to be resilient with home entertainment becoming more of a staple category as consumers keep up with technology

5702471 based on recent valuations from independent valuers whose reports are yet to be completed the companys assets are in current market conditions worth substantially less than the prior year
5702472 as a consequence of the revaluations and the anticipated loss the company is in breach of several loan conditions set by its bankers and is currently in discussions to obtain a waiver of these conditions
5702473 if institutional investors are not equipped to account for the impact of climate change on investments they ultimately contribute to sending the wrong price signal to the market
5702474 over the long term this can have major consequences including on how assets are priced and therefore how capital is allocated in the economy
5702475 like so many other industries in australia today responsible investment is constrained by a skills shortage
5702476 this should increase the pace of adaptation to a carbon constrained economy
5702477 if lower risk companies are not recognised through higher share prices this also has the potential to impact on the allocation of capital in the economy
5702478 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives
5702479 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally

5702483 when i ran my way back in i had this moment i wrote on my handlebars today sing like adam kreek hes our mens eight rower who bellowed out the national anthem during the gold medal ceremony it flashed through my head sing like kreek buddy and i thought lets take off lets go and i tried i tried hard
5702484 for a moment there i thought i had it i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had i wanted to discourage them and put it out there that if youre going to beat me youre going to have to hurt way more
5702485 it was so close for a moment there i actually thought i kind of had it but im very very proud to have had the courage to put it forward to show that i was there to win im very proud and very happy to have the silver
5702486 i threw it away i figured there was a kind of symbolism to it it was kind of now or never id been patient and kept fighting my way back and i was relentless but once i threw the cap away it was like its back on
5702487 do you want to know what i honestly thought i rolled up behind them and i said you just made the biggest mistake you ever made i thought to myself frig it here we go thats what i thought if youre going to beat me youre going to hurt so much doing it
5702488 having been through this eight years ago and then having to fight my way back to this podium that was hard that was so hard that was a harder race than it was in sydney in sydney i just rolled along and i beat a german today a german got me back
5702489 oh my god i wanted to stop and watch the rest of the race i was so close to stopping i really didnt care about the rest of my race it was so exciting
5702490 it worked spectacularly today he was spectacular today the communication was spectacular
5702491 im glad we had at fortitude to do it under some criticism
5702492 we dont intend to roam with anyone else domestically we intend to stick with our partner telstra
5702493 if you look at the other telcos published results and you take in to account that we only sell in 60 of the country because we only sell in areas where we have network were punching well beyond our weight
5702494 soa is all about the granularity of organization it assets
5702495 all of the preconditions in the world are there for gold to make a substantial run over the the next 12 months
5702496 if the gold price and the australian dollar continue to display synchronicity in an inverse sense then as the gold price comes off then the aussie dollar will come off as well
5702497 we are getting approaches from a lot of third parties asking us if we would be interested being a partner in particular projects
5702498 im not mincing my words at all in zimbabwe the government seizes land and assets off farmers and hands them over to their followers and in mildura whats happening is that the trust is being seized from the community by parliamentary fiat without debate or discussion
5702499 and those assets we believe are slated for being stripped from the first mildura irrigation trust ratepayers and sold to benefit lower murray water as a business
5702500 it is the board which has broken the law and left the government with no choice but to act to protect the interests of local farmers
5702501 now that i have made the determination lower murray water will take over the customers staff and assets of first mildura irrigation trust
5702502 in the long term we expect those materials nickel and aluminium to recover and be part of the industrialisation process but are they more exposed to any slowdown yes
5702503 we expect continued competitive market conditions and input cost pressures in asia
5702504 despite the depressed us and australian housing markets we have long term confidence in these key markets
5702505 we believe that the underlying demand level in the us is about 1 8 million starts excluding manufactured housing and in australia is around 185 000 starts per annum
5702506 we are forecasting that the second half of this year will outperform the half we are reporting
5702507 we have invested in advantate the joint venture with fairfax digital that is just beginning operations and in the recently acquired verisign digital brands services dbs business that is now being integrated into melbourne it
5702508 we are investing in systems to support those enterprises have spent close on 5 million so far and are flagging we will spend a similar amount going forward culturally we have to do that for our future survival
5702509 we want to be a great company globally and the way we will do that is by investing in these systems and infrastructure projects we believe that there will be a greater appetite for services from both smes and corporates going forward
5702510 so we need to get our systems right which will give us a competitive advantage and the ability to provision still more services and to do that so efficiently that we generate significant profits
5702511 no more being told what to watch and when to watch it this is tv your way

5702560 he sen webb creates a new bureaucracy and new rules his bill offers the same benefits whether you stay three years or longer we want to have a sliding scale to increase retention
5702561 im happy to tell you that we probably agreed on an increase in educational benefits for our veterans
5702562 based on strikingly irrational beliefs and emotions modern liberals relentlessly undermine the most important principles on which our freedoms were founded
5702563 like spoiled angry children they rebel against the normal responsibilities of adulthood and demand that a parental government meet their needs from cradle to grave
5702564 a social scientist who understands human nature will not dismiss the vital roles of free choice voluntary cooperation and moral integrity as liberals do
5702565 a political leader who understands human nature will not ignore individual differences in talent drive personal appeal and work ethic and then try to impose economic and social equality on the population as liberals do and a legislator who understands human nature will not create an environment of rules which over regulates and over taxes the nations citizens corrupts their character and reduces them to wards of the state as liberals do
5702566 the roots of liberalism and its associated madness can be clearly identified by understanding how children develop from infancy to adulthood and how distorted development produces the irrational beliefs of the liberal mind
5702567 when the modern liberal mind whines about imaginary victims rages against imaginary villains and seeks above all else to run the lives of persons competent to run their own lives the neurosis of the liberal mind becomes painfully obvious
5702568 mccains record is fairly clean a few brusque denials of past changes in cases such as immigration he has frankly acknowledged his switch and admitted to yielding to popular demand
5702569 no one does not have to super intelligent to get into harvard obamas sat score was 16 he got in with aa and minority status only when you are white do you have to have excellent grades blacks are not expected to have high grades
5702570 i would rather speak at a rally or a political gathering any place outside of the country after i am president of the united states
5702571 but thats a judgment that sen obama and the american people will make
5702572 mccain himself gave a speech in canada to the economic club of canada in which he applauded naftas successes an implicit message behind that speech was that obama had been critical of the trade accord
5702573 estamos desatados por utilizar un t rmino empezamos la semana pasada en obispo ramos de lora y andr s bello donde colocamos alrededor de dos millones de bol vares fuertes entre los dos municipios luego fuimos a tulio febres cordero donde ubicamos tres millones de bol vares fuertes m s en miranda fue un mill n de bol vares en un acto en cardenal quintero otorgamos a ese municipio y a pueblo llano alrededor de tres millones de bol vares fuertes este s bado en rangel fue un mill n de bol vares fuertes quedando por entregar 400 mil bol vares fuertes en sucre y el grueso de los recursos est apartado para alberto adriani seis millones de bol vares fuertes
5702574 la mentira m s grande ya que es el estado pionero en la conformaci n de esas formas asociativas de organizaci n del pueblo con casi tres mil en la actualidad totalmente activos y pr cticamente todos han recibido recursos
5702575 el pueblo no es tonto sabe qui n eres t que pisoteaste la constituci n que fuiste part cipe del golpe de estado que pisoteaste ese mismo poder popular del cual ahora quieres sacar bandera nosotros estamos claros que nuestro proceso revolucionario est enmarcado en eso hacia la transferencia del poder al pueblo el pueblo ha crecido y simplemente les dar una derrota m s el pr ximo 23 de noviembre de este a o cuando se realicen las elecciones regionales
5702576 estamos de fiesta conmemorando ocho a os desde que la revoluci n bolivariana lleg al poder a m rida aun cuando tengamos errores que corregir son tantos los aciertos que no alcanzar a papel para escribirlos todos

5702579 while everyone here is raring to go i dont think well be ready to go by the trial date
5702580 we have the opportunity today to state our priorities here in city government
5702581 everybody in this room could be donating to some other cause or to their own well being but i want to thank you
5702582 faced with the embarrassing prospect of holding a fundraiser with one of jack abramoffs closest associates the mccain campaign scrambled today to scratch ralph reed from tonights program but voters deserve to know the answers to the real questions raised by reeds involvement
5702583 if the mccain campaign wont return the money reed has raised for them then voters should rightly ask why it matters that reed didnt show up at tonights event the real question isnt why reed isnt showing up but why a so called reformer would invite him at all
5702584 before the obama campaign launches attacks they should stop and think about the amount of money that has been raised through convicted criminal and longtime fundraiser tony rezko
5702585 it takes a lot of audacity for obama and his spokespeople to criticize john mccain when obama was involved in a questionable home purchase with rezkos wife and years of friendship and dealings with a man convicted of wire and mail fraud money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery
5702586 while we know this settlement will never ease the pain of those enduring enormous heartbreak it does bring years of court proceedings to an end
5702587 to have a fire inspector miss the foam on several occasions i just dont see how they would have survived the scrutiny of a trial
5702588 how can they decide that all 100 that died and all that was burned and everything all the survivors that their lives are only worth 10 million
5702589 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5702590 is that it were going to hang him on that
5702591 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5702592 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first

5702595 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5702596 documentary evidence shows that advantage is an example of marketing framed as science
5702597 failure to disclose the primary purpose of a trial has ethical ramifications for patients physicians and the design of clinical trials
5702598 seeding trials like advantage in which the study medication has yet to receive u s food and drug administration approval may cause patient injury for marketing purposes
5702599 we played really well fantastically well in the first quarter actualy
5702600 we let go a bit later in the game which was a bit disappointing we have a very young team so we have been rebuilding since 2006 a big challenge has been to stay with the gameplan even in the easier games to keep playing even though we are winning for example in our 40 0 win against swizerland
5702601 we have a meeting tomorrow to evaluate our effort and then we are going to start working our butts off for the 2010 in manchester
5702602 we want to finish in the top four and so we have a lot of work to do because a lot of them dont want us up there well be working hard
5702603 i am impressed with the german team which had a great team with only one us player finland i think has improved also they already impressed us in ontario in 2006 and it is good to see that they have stepped up again the many new teams here is also a good thing it shows that the sport is getting bigger and bigger
5702604 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5702605 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally
5702606 because the obvious purpose of orbit is to invest in equity securities and attempt to circumvent the constitutional prohibition on investing in equity securities it had an illegal purpose
5702607 to avoid the constitutional prohibition on investing in equity securities
5702608 id be shocked if this is the end based on how hard the california franchise tax board has fought every step of the way for 10 years
5702609 were reviewing the matter and hope to have a decision soon
5702610 he wanted a better place for his business and his life
5702611 there was the added benefit of no nevada income tax
5702612 they saw my client was receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing from his patents
5702613 rather than conduct a fair and impartial audit they essentially went into it to find a way to get money from him
5702614 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5702615 in my mother and das passing we will carry something of their spirit to the next generation
5702616 i was upset about the part of me being sold for 2 million
5702617 at times like this nobody is trying to sell me i could have come out and said oh yeah cam got bought out but i didnt go that route they just gotta watch me move we gonna make it hot
5702618 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract
5702619 i tell people i couldnt do business with him but i will say he gave me the biggest chance i needed im a dude from the hood so the chance he gave me is a chance i needed to never turn back im good my artistry my talent my career was never built on controversy so i would never come out and say a whole bunch of things that could be said all i can say is im sorry he cant be here to be a part of whats about to happen because were about to tear em up
5702620 street kids united by loyalty and loot goons and n as getting it
5702621 i got a chance to learn a lot and be around cam and jim and watch us the diplomats one of the greatest movements and still one of the greatest movements doing this thing today i know the ins and outs of what it takes to build a powerful movement i know the things that got us to the points where we needed to be then i know some of the things that was holding us back i get to work around the things i need to work around jim has byrd gang i have the skull gang and freekey zekey has 730
5702622 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together
5702623 at first people kinda looked at us like damn whats going on
5702624 they looking at us like were disloyal but as the time went by its kinda like what we gonna do just die out because the dude that was supposed to be the boss and the head of the table decided to disappear that means we would have vanished along with that we from harlem baby we hustlers were gonna stay afloat were not even floating right now were surfing we not even surfing im the ocean

5702630 im going to be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5702631 youre going to get killed or get to do some killing
5702632 the emergence of sweden finland and the netherlands are the biggest surprices sweden was particular succesful with predominantly swedish players and coaches
5702633 they have seven americans on the team including both the goalie and face off positions their face off guy aaron vanderhorst killed us we were hoping to tire him out by switching face off guys but he was in superb condition
5702634 after the first half we had 26 shots on goal and the netherlands only nine normally that means you should be up by two thirds but the score was 6 2
5702635 i think many of these guys are relatively new because there was way too many penalties
5702636 lacrosse is ment to be the fastest game on two feet how can it be the fastest game on two feet when there was 36 time serving penalties in our game against ireland we spend all our time waiting for the officials to agree on the penalties instead of running up and down the field
5702637 the overall percentage was 95 which is very high in fact it is the highest score ever in a european tournament and nearly the highest score ever
5702638 in 2006 at the worlds the average score was just over 90 percent so the referees are getting better and better
5702639 many of the coaches here are from the usa hopefully they know the international rules but they are used to ncaa rules and they are a bit different it can be difficult for the coaches to understand but really when the clock stops it is because of the players when they slash we make the call it is that simple matthias lockemann said when explaining the mismatch between the coaches perception and the high assesment scores
5702640 simply narrowed the issues in this case by disposing of defendants contention that their constitutional rights to free speech and the free exercise of religion exempt them from complying with unruh civil rights acts prohibition against sexual orientation discrimination
5702641 er bestaat in ons land geen instituut voor ongevalanalyse die de werkelijke oorzaken van ongevallen moet onderzoeken zo zijn bij bijna 50 procent van alle ongevallen op de autosnelwegen vrachtwagens betrokken en die mogen amper 90 km u rijden van die camions zijn er nog vier op tien ingeschreven in het buitenland die niet weten dat men hier bij regenweer niet mag voorbijsteken
5702642 schouppe echter om de boetes te doen met nieuwe flitspalen op de autosnelwegen wil hij het gat in de schatkist vullen
5702643 schouppe zou beter zijn energie steken in het oplossen van het fileprobleem het gevaar bij wegeniswerken de slechte staat van onze autostrades
5702644 this was an incredibly balanced and well thought out and complete decision and i am amazed that any person can listen to all we heard in the court and reach that decision in 24 hours
5702645 door blessures speelden we op het middenveld met drie nummer 10s en dat wreekt zich op je spel er heerst ontgoocheling maar ik besef dat we verdiend verloren hebben de volgende wedstrijd voor het brons tegen brazili of argentini zal niet makkelijk worden maar we moeten ons toch proberen op te laden
5702646 een groot verlies voor het afrikaanse continent en de democratie
5702647 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
5702648 musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
5702649 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5702650 we hadden veel moeite met de kracht en de snelheid van onze tegenstander tijdens het tweede half uur waren we beter in de wedstrijd en hadden we moeten scoren toen de 2 0 viel kregen we een tik al heeft niemand de armen laten zakken en zijn we blijven voetballen de tegenstander was echter te sterk
5702651 in zon match moet elke halve kans binnen onze effici ntie was te zwak om onze droom waar te maken ik ben niet verrast door deze nigerianen want twee jaar geleden speelden ze al een finale tegen brazili
5702652 vergeet niet dat we tegen itali lang met tien man gespeeld hebben dat heeft veel energie gekost en bovendien hebben we maar 13 veldspelers meer over we moeten echter nieuwe motivatie vinden en blijven geloven in onze eigen kansen want een medaille zit er nog steeds in de komende drie dagen zullen we er alles aan doen om klaar te zijn

5702658 after playing through a few levels of the force unleashed last week it appears that lucasarts may indeed deliver on its promise and give us a new look at the force like weve never experienced
5702659 from the start its immediately evident that the control setup is put together in a way that allows you work with both your lightsaber and force powers in a very smooth and cohesive manner two face buttons work your saber with quick and heavy attacks while another unleashes a force push which is an incredibly effective way of finishing off a lightsaber combo the right trigger makes use of the force grab releasing it then uses force push while the left trigger acts as a modifier for force powers for example holding the left trigger while enacting a force push will unleash an area push shoving everything around you away from you while using the left trigger with a lightsaber attack button will perform a lightsaber throw the cool bit about the lightsaber combat system is that while you can quickly mash on buttons to dispose of an enemy steady and timed presses will reward you with better combos its an interesting system that isnt apparent at the start but once you start experimenting with it youll wind up finishing off enemies with a few more twists and slashes from your trusty saber
5702660 coming back to the controls it must be said that movement control on wii isnt as smooth as it could be at this stage and with the game coming out in late september were assuming its not going to change much with camera control in particular a bit of a weak point one of the disadvantages of only having one analogue stick we guess
5702661 i had seen so many book trailers which were exactly like every other book commercial you see scary voice guy tells you what it says on the back of the book jacket but none of those trailers ever invested you in the story or the characters and thats what the best movie trailers do so i wrote what you see brandon graham and extended books did the filming and production i treated it like my own personal independent film the goal was to create the trailer for the greatest movie that didnt exist and then like any independent film i called in some friends the goal was simple we wanted to change how books are sold hows that for presumptuous
5702662 staff from the law society of scotland and the office of the scottish legal services ombudsman are eligible to transfer to the commission under the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations tupe and the cabinet office statement of practice on staff transfers in the public sector cosop respectively staff consultations are still underway in both organisations and decisions on whether or not to transfer will be taken by the staff involved once this process has been completed
5702663 once the commission is established a harmonisation exercise will take place involving senior management and staff representatives from both former slso and former lss staff who will discuss differences in employment terms and conditions and proposals for their resolution the timing of this harmonisation is for the commission to consider in due course
5702664 there has been significant lobbying from the law society on the issue of their staff transferring to the new commission and the justice department team either dont understand or dont accept the importance of having the former ombudsman staff on board
5702665 it is being seen as vital the profession keep control over regulation of complaints at all levels in the new commission these ombudsman staff cannot be trusted to tow the line if a conflict between the law society and the commission arises

5702670 here is my 1956 ripple bonnet 2cv it is regarded by other drivers either with derision or admiration in roughly equal measure
5702671 i learned to drive aged seven in one of my fathers 2cvs so there was no hesitation when it came to choosing a car to drive away from the church on our wedding day

5702703 when i hear about teams who struggle with agile assess the situation choose to keep the parts that work and abandon the rest i see this as being agile not becoming post agile
5702704 maybe they are right but who cares if it is agile or not
5702705 only after american car makers had exhausted every other explanation for toyotas success an undervalued yen a docile workforce japanese culture superior automation were they finally able to admit that toyotas real advantage was its ability to harness the intellect of ordinary employees
5702706 occurs when the task becomes the all consuming passion for those involved
5702707 given the issues and enablers you just identified with agile leadership what are the topics you would most like to see presented and discussed this year
5702708 we hear about these ideas and they sound good but in our projects the same old stuff keeps happening how do we get real results
5702709 is the term used to explain the phenomenon of blindly replicating outward
5702710 i like this a lot my take is that we have an obligation to lay an appealing trail of breadcrumbs to lead people along the path of figuring out stuff for them selves
5702711 if you cannot summarize it on only one page you need to go off and learn more about it
5702712 not sure if the sponsor is committed to the project try ordering that expensive kit you need and see if they approve it
5702713 not sure if the dba group is on board with working with an agile team then move up your database work and try some see if there really are problems
5702714 by chip and dan heath and i realized that it has the stickiness and appeal of a greased electric eel made to stick
5702715 a friend of a friend of ours is a frequent business traveler
5702716 sir i want you to reach behind you slowly and carefully is there a tube protruding from your lower back
5702717 sir dont panic but one of your kidneys has been harvested theres a ring of organ thieves operating in this city and they got to you paramedics are on their way dont move until they arrive
5702718 if you argue ten points even if each is a good point when they get back to the jury room they wont remember any
5702719 a bird in hand is worth two in the bush
5702720 before you vote ask yourself if you are better off today than you were four years ago
5702721 if i can make it there i can make it anywhere
5702722 we are in a knowledge age yet most of our management principles are from an industrial age
5702723 then will cover the last three topics in a later post and attach the final paper with the
5702724 employers should have confidence only in certifications that are skill based and difficult to achieve
5702725 you have one tongue in your head and two in your shoes use them in those proportions
5702726 you can use all agile some of the time and some agile all of the time
5702727 when the best leaders work is done the people say we did it ourselves
5702728 leaders need to reveal a beckoning summit towards which others can chart their own course
5702729 to cover different topics i was able to visit the agile 2008 conference venue in december when the last
5702730 chairs for the conference and we have been allocated a great venue a large bright ballroom with high ceilings and lots of natural light this year the conference has much more space and larger mingling areas both indoors and out which i am sure will help
5702731 a proposal the cumulative scores for proposals help determine what gets selected
5702732 one reason for this omission is that it is a skill that i struggle with and i did not feel qualified to talk about my style is more reserved and i have to go outside of my comfort zone to outwardly project my eagerness however the fact remains that it is an important role
5702733 portion is very important as a social group team members easily feed off of each others energy levels
5702734 the same is true for users they may cause us issues and headaches but they are the reason we are there and developing software in the first place the truth is that on agile projects we do not want user input we actually need user input in order to be successful agile projects are deliberately light on capturing initial requirements because we realize that requirements are likely to change and evaluation of an emerging system will surface new requirements and improvements to existing requirements that we want to encourage this idea of evolving towards the true business requirements rather than the initially stated requirements which are often flawed is a cornerstone of iterative development some people use a guided missile analogy when your target is moving you have to make lots of mid course adjustments to hit your target however missiles have lots of negative connotations they are destructive and generally blow up and hurt people not a good analogy for a project environment however try to concentrate on their ability to steer towards a moving target and instead imagine they deliver a bunch of flowers once they get there not an explosion you cannot chase a dog with a train
5702735 the project will now cost an extra 400k and be delivered 3 months later than originally planned

5702740 memang mendiknas dan sekretaris jenderal departemen agama tadi menyampaikan pemaparan anggaran tambahan untuk pendidikan sebesar rp 46 1 triliun namun tidak secara spesifik pemaparan itu disampaikan karena itu akan dibahas lagi minggu depan
5702741 kalau untuk alokasi depag dan depdiknas semuanya lebih dari rp 110 triliun jadi separuh lebih sisanya didaerahkan
5702742 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st
5702743 bring it i still help elect the popes around here last time i checked
5702744 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
5702745 i cant say enough about how good this movie that you probably havent read so im going to keep this short this is the best thing out there in theaters right now and might just be the best animated film of all time whether you believe that or not is your own opinion but what pixar has done here can put companies like dreamworks sony and blue sky to shame wall e also may go down as the most lovable character ever to grace the movie screen i praise ben burtt and andrew stanton and the people at pixar for what they did and will continue to do this is why pixar is the top studio in the world
5702746 holly we need to get all this done first i think richard was getting upset i dont want him to be upset and stressed out
5702747 huh gina he is not stressed out thats not being upset i told you we dont even ever argue
5702748 it was nothing now sit down well do all that in a little bit
5702749 can people come over its my last night at church before college
5702750 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5702751 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5702752 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look the i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5702753 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5702754 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the gi bill as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but the people of arizona and of all america expect more from their representatives than that and instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5702755 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5702756 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5702757 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5702758 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5702759 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5702760 one may use the radio a cellphone a blackberry bluetooth wireless a slingbox and perhaps a satellite tv feed whether mccain actually used any of those devices we have no idea but he absolutely had the ability to use them which is all that mitchell had reported
5702761 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle
5702762 we are concerned that your news division is following msnbcs lead in abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race we would like to request a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss our deep concerns about the news standards and level of objectivity at nbc

5702770 however the strike shows the depth of feeling among local government workers
5702771 council workers are feeling the real effect of the massive financial squeeze the snp government have forced on local councils
5702772 as well as causing cuts to vital education and social work services we now have disruption to all our council services
5702773 it is a clear responsibility of government to make sure local councils have enough cash to maintain our vital public services and in that regard the snp government are failing
5702774 in little over a year in office they have forced council workers onto the streets to take action not seen for years and years
5702775 i hope the government councils and the unions can resolve their differences quickly and we can see an end to this action
5702776 whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his 1life a ransom for many
5702777 great men are not sitting on top of lesser men but bearing lesser men on their backs
5702778 whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant
5702779 it was for this he called you through our gospel that you may gain the glory of our lord jesus christ
5702780 per un ideale si e pronti a morire per il potere si e pronti ad uccidere
5702781 every age has its gospel of ease it grows from the natural human desire to wrap eternal truth around temporal pleasure it transforms every human whim into the will of god and offers comfort as the chief reward of righteousness but it is a false gospel one that leaves men both weak and vain it makes every hardship an intruder and every difficulty an offense it cushions men from the very means god uses to fashion them in his image and give them lives of weight and consequence likewise in every age there are those who challenge the gospel of ease insisting that hardship is a redemptive tool in the hands of a loving god these stalwarts rage against a gospel that merely sanctifies the materialistic stupor of the times they call for a people who embrace hardship as the price of change both in themselves and a fallen world morever they challenge believers to allow what they endure to liberate them form their lower selves to free them from the merely earthly in pursuit of the truly spiritual
5702782 ich will die angelegenheit auf ein neues level bef rdern

5702787 wir alle wissen dass salzburg im bereich der forschung besser werden muss das h ngt nat rlich auch mit unseren standortproblemen zusammen dass wir relativ wenig industrie haben die selbst forschungsstark ist umso wichtiger ist es dass die ffentliche hand etwas tut
5702788 in places bombing had damaged sluice gates and in others the system was simply in disrepair because the government had not been able to do projects there
5702789 so we worked with usaid and sought their help in funding and providing technical assistance to repair the system we believe that the improved security and repaired canal and irrigation system will set the conditions for alternative crop programs to be introduced by the government of the islamic republic of afghanistan
5702790 this should enable the hospital to attract more staff and to provide a more comprehensive service people are delighted to have any healthcare in the district
5702791 we sought to provide assistance based on local community needs in some villages there was an urgent need to provide drinking water and irrigation so we quickly responded by getting funding and contractors to start on those weve also funded repairs to a couple of village cultural buildings these efforts will be completed before we leave

5702794 businesses are taking steps to make their it operations more dynamic and are delving into virtualization as a cornerstone strategy
5702795 idc research is finding that the use of server virtualization is moving past the early adopter stage and is quickly becoming a mainstream solution
5702796 anyone who doesnt think this movie will influence the attitudes and behaviour of young people toward people with disabilities hasnt been in a high school or around young kids recently as soon as they leave the theatre kids are quoting movie lines and acting out scenes as well as the actors did they wont care that this movie is meant to be a parody of hollywoods excesses
5702797 they searched the taxi the child travels in and found a 9mm pistol
5702798 the taxi owner was very shocked and relieved that the gun had been found
5702799 in 1932 there was the first racer back suit in 1956 there was the debut of the mens brief at the melbourne olympics
5702800 we love it and what were finding is that the swimmers whove worn that suit have dropped two percent off their best times which is an enormous amount
5702801 we asked them how they wanted to feel on the blocks
5702802 michael phelps said that he wanted to feel like superman
5702803 i feel better in the water than i have in any other suit
5702804 you know chuck i might have to get out of the navy
5702805 i was still in the dive i had just started to pull out and got hit by a surface to air missile and it basically took the wing off the aircraft
5702806 and so i was gyrating very violently almost straight down so i had to eject very quickly
5702807 then we all pushed him here to the edge of the lake and the security forces surrounded him at that point everyone in the village was here everyone came down to see the american pilot
5702808 would you like him to be president of the united states
5702809 that depends on the u s people i dont know
5702810 he would never admit the united states made a mistake in the war therefore i say john mccain is an extremely conservative man he was loyal to his ideology
5702811 i wasnt as tough as i had hoped to be and i certainly wasnt as strong as some of my comrades
5702812 there was a correlation between my refusal to accept early release and my treatment
5702813 because after it was clear to the vietnamese i would not do that then the treatment got very much worse
5702814 i think in many ways it was harder on him than it was on me
5702815 this is not true because our nation is civilized and humanitarian and you do not understand the vietnamese nation
5702816 i had my front teeth knocked out i had my cheekbone broken i had my nose broken
5702817 beaten with a fan belt for three of four days
5702818 put your elbows behind your back and tighten up the rope around your elbows until your shoulders dislocated
5702819 its just a chapter in my life that id rather remember the good parts than the bad parts
5702820 i dont know what the point is of going through all that
5702821 we thought wed be home for christmas of 69 and there we were and there we were for three more christmases 70 71 and 72
5702822 and his theory on the war at that time was do it
5702823 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5702824 is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded with early school hours
5702825 parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5702826 usually it starts with an image i have a particular image in mind and i suspect theres something deeper in it so i follow it
5702827 i love novels of unusual coincidences and quotidian strangeness and apparently this ones full of the extraordinary ordinary ariel gore author of atlas of the human heart and my future wife said its her favourite book ever thats enough to get it on my list

5702839 we were in love with each other at the time we recorded that album
5702840 we were new friends discovering new parts about each other and we had songs and we had the ability to translate those songs into records that was astounding and we knew it when we walked out of the studio with that two track under our arm we knew what it was going to do we knew that it was going to be a hit we knew that we had nailed something that wasnt really that popular kind of then it was all led zeppelin and jimi hendrix and stuff and here comes this little acoustic record
5702841 there were lots of kids and elderly people around watching
5702842 she was screaming nasty nasty things yelling you didnt stop for me
5702843 she was bleeding from the hands from trying to stop the attack
5702844 chinatowns on the other hand feels like any other suburb where house prices start at around 350k
5702845 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5702846 and no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run i will honor senator mccains service just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states

5702858 none we will put up signs on some tall profile buildings you dont get attention by obeying the law
5702859 someone has to stand out and sacrifice thats what hero is made of we need more protests ten days into the olympic games the total number of protesters arrested in beijing is fewer than the protesters arrested in disneyland california yesterday 32 we need to catch up
5702860 great it helped me getting over the fact that china is sitting on top of my country on the medal stand im also glad that i made it ahead of other people if i dont make up this story they will

5702863 matts a wrestler he might want to come out and trade punches with me but im assuming at some point in the fight hes gonna try taking me down
5702864 im comfortable for it to go to ground im not worried about ending up on my back
5702865 itll probably be one of those fights where id just be looking to get back up on my feet again to continue throwing punches
5702866 im the type of guy who likes to come out throwing punches and trying to excite the fans thats my gameplan every fight
5702867 matts strong like a bull quite possibly im gonna end up on my back a couple of times in this fight if i do end up on my back will he be able to keep me there well see
5702868 im pleased to get out on my own and start playing
5702869 ive wanted the chance to play in the spl for a couple of seasons now and im just delighted to be here and playing
5702870 its a steep learning for him especially considering the situation were in at the moment
5702871 in an ideal world i wouldnt be playing in central midfield weve had a couple of injuries and weve had to deal with the situation we are in at the moment
5702872 so it was hard for jack in the first half but in the second half i thought he grew into the game
5702873 when you cross the line all the pressure that has built up the expectation and the self doubt evaporates just like that
5702874 when you want something that much and the hours you put in it is an amazing feeling when you achieve it
5702875 but from what ive seen he is going to score goals
5702876 we are definitely going to appeal because the test results of the same samples are different
5702877 this was always a game which people would look forward to and it should be a good game
5702878 we got a point the last time we played chelsea and im looking forward to playing against them again who knows we might get all three this time
5702879 i was told that alan irvine prestons manager was going to ring me three weeks ago he has not called me back and i dont know what that was about
5702880 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5702881 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5702882 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5702883 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5702884 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5702885 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5702886 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5702887 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5702891 the innovative xerox color technology produces documents that rival the leaders in the color printer market as the market continues the transition to color xerox is well positioned to be a major player

5702894 does not strip workers of their right to choose a secret ballot election to decide whether to select or not to select a union representative
5702895 it is not until the union obtains signatures from 75 or more of the unit that the union has more than a 50 likelihood of winning the election
5702896 petitioning for a representation election requires a showing that 35 percent of the eligible employees have signed cards however the general policy of the airline division is to file for a representation election only after receiving a 65 percent card return from the eligible voters in a group
5702897 the signing of authorization cards is a very significant part of the campaign the cards confirm that a majority of the bargaining unit is committed to forming a union while not a hard and fast rule ideally we like to see between 70 and 80 percent of the crew sign see counter campaign while the employer will not see who signed the cards the employer will know how many cards were signed the more cards we have the stronger our messages
5702898 signed pledge cards typically are needed from at least 30 percent of the employees to trigger an nlrb sanctioned election maritas said the spfpas policy is to collect pledge cards from at least 70 percent of the workers before filing an election petition
5702899 have 70 75 percent of members sign cards if unable to reach this goal review plan
5702900 at the meeting the union organizers verbally indicated that they had withdrawn the petition because they had originally had the support of 70 of the staff but now felt that they did not represent a clear majority and would not feel comfortable with a union in the store which only represent ed slightly more than half of the workforce at the store
5702901 to obtain an election through the services of the nlrb at least 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit must sign authorization cards for a valid petition as a practical matter the gcc ibt prefers about 70 percent of the eligible voters to have signed cards
5702902 the rule of thumb in the seiu is that its unwise to file for an election when fewer than 70 percent of the workforce have signed interest cards
5702903 it is no surprise we win only 50 percent of nlrb elections even though we normally wait for card signatures from 70 percent of more of the work force before filing a petition
5702904 in modern practice union organizers usually collect card from 60 to 70 percent of the workers in the bargaining union before proceeding to the next step
5702905 if the union was able to establish workers support of the union by a showing of signed union authorization cards from at least 30 percent of workers it could petition the national labor relations board nlrb for an election however because employee support for unions typically wanes in the weeks leading up to an election unions generally sought to obtain 50 percent to 70 percent or more of the signed union authorization cards before seeking an election
5702906 his motivation and expertise gave a lasting impression as he spoke to the campers on his experiences of being a teacher and principal

5702926 this isnt a debate about interpretation its an error by the productivity commission it created 400 million out of thin air
5702927 i actually get negative benefits a cost to the economy ranging from 14 million per year to 92 million but these are tiny numbers in the context of the economy so its best to conclude that the net welfare effect is roughly zero

5702931 where practical the national greenhouse and energy reporting system will be used as the basis for monitoring
5702932 however in some areas ngers will need to be strengthened to support the special financial importance attached to emissions reported under the scheme
5702933 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown
5702934 data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money aggregates fell by almost us50 billion in july the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
5702935 but i see that hedge funds are circulating a report from the us guru jeremy grantham predicting a very bad end to gordon browns debt experiment
5702936 the uk housing event is probably second only to the japanese 1990 land bubble in the real estate bubble hall of fame uk house prices could easily decline 50 from the peak and at that lower level they would still be higher than they were in 1997 as a multiple of income
5702937 if prices go all the way back to trend and history says that is extremely likely then the uk financial system will need some serious bail outs and the global ripples will be substantial
5702938 the paradigm has flipped the fed may have been right after all to slash rates to 2 the european central bank may have panicked by tightening in july note that the elder swiss national bank did not do anything so rash
5702939 bulls now believe america is turning the corner financial stocks are up 20 since early july some monoline bond insurers have risen 1200 in a month as fears of gotterdammerung give way to sheer intoxicating relief and a short squeeze such are bear trap rallies
5702940 the futures market is pricing a 33 fall in us house prices from peak to trough based on the case shiller index banks have not come close to writing off implied losses on this scale
5702941 i do not think we are near the end of write downs i continue to see capital levels going lower and stocks going lower
5702942 this painful ordeal is far from over we are not witnessing a dollar rally so much as a collapse in european and commodity currencies the race to the bottom has begun in earnest
5702943 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the u s and the global economy
5702944 but declining customer satisfaction combined with weaker demand for u s exports may make it difficult for american households to shoulder the burden of being the locomotive for world economic growth
5702945 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts
5702946 this is not going to be helpful as the big three will lose more pricing power and be forced to continue dependence on rebates and discounting in a market where consumer preferences keep shifting away from domestic cars
5702947 this is product extension at its best where the new products
5702948 he commanded large numbers of insurgent fighters and committed atrocities against afghan police officers who worked to improve the safety and stability of their country
5702949 mullah akhtar mohammed was difficult to pinpoint as he travelled within a very small group
5702950 the special operations task group located him positively identified him and when it was confirmed that there were no non combatant afghans nearby accurately targeted him for the successful air strike
5702951 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the u s and the global economy

5702956 when an elected prime minister is ousted he is subjected to execution prison or exile but when a dictator leaves he is presented the guard of honour
5702957 musharrafs brazen disrespect for human rights and the rule of law for nearly a decade has finally caught up with him
5702958 by undoing musharrafs unlawful acts and holding him to account for his crimes the pakistani government will advance human rights and national security in the country
5702959 our position on workplace bullying is very strong we just wont stand for it
5702960 it came round to broader understanding of the issue and that it needed to be tackled in a national way but there was really nothing new that came out of there today
5702961 having examined the evidence which led to this particular budget initiative we have made a decision that we will not be supporting it
5702962 they were negligent in not taking him to the hospital im just bamboozled by it
5702963 i want to take some action against dhs the department of human services because i think they were negligent by hiring such incompetent carers im really angry about it
5702964 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5702965 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5702966 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5702967 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5702968 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5702969 even though we havent found the remains the fact that the process of finding their loved ones has started is really important both for the families and for timor leste as a whole
5702970 mr gusmaos visit gave credence to the families and that was hugely important for them
5702971 engaged with the communities in the task of finding the grave
5702972 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion about this
5702973 our family toured the wine regions of napa sonoma and the mid coast of california as well as tuscany in italy and the rhine river valley in germany
5702974 we went to many inns and wineries and brought back the best ideas from each region
5702975 we wanted these buildings to look like they belong here and we think the architects have done a wonderful job of giving a current interpretation to the victorian farmhouse look
5702976 sometimes i feel like sir james murray must have felt while he was grubbing away at writing the oxford english dictionary
5702977 he managed to complete the first 17 letters before he died
5702978 i like to say that the arrangement of genes on chromosomes is part of the microanatomy
5702979 rather nonchalantly used his sandaled foot to draw a cross in the dirt
5702980 he was to western shirts what henry ford was to cars
5702981 the west is not a place its a state of mind
5702982 the innovative xerox color technology produces documents that rival the leaders in the color printer market as the market continues the transition to color xerox is well positioned to be a major player

5702985 on wednesday he gave the impression to keepers that he wasnt feeling too well
5702986 on friday he wasnt eating or drinking properly and seemed to be growing weaker we were keeping a close eye on him but suddenly on saturday morning he died
5702987 many of the visitors were terribly shocked this perhaps is one of the greatest gifts that a zoo can bestow to show that animals are very much like ourselves and feel elation and pain
5702988 gana lost a child but i think in that loss she taught people here so much
5702989 we risk going down in the history books as the generation that let sharks go extinct because of an insatiable market for shark products
5702990 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating
5702991 it was good to have someone else to talk to and brainstorm some ideas with
5702992 im absolutely convinced that connex has made a complete mess of it
5702993 the government would be wise to not reappoint connex to run the suburban railways and wiser still to bring the whole operation back into public hands
5702994 the facts are well known that franchised public transport has delivered good value for money and will continue to do so
5702995 the benefits are huge in terms of their wellbeing and mental output
5702996 there is compelling evidence that suggests exercise is good for the brain and helps generate new brain cells even in the ageing brain
5702997 we want students to take responsibility for their own fitness so there is a bit of a survey to establish their fitness levels and goals
5702998 people who have higher levels of involvement in activity tend to also perform better on academic tasks
5702999 it seems to me craziness when we have got 83 000 aboriginal people sitting in the job network system without a job
5703000 it is not rocket science here we could move aboriginal people across into these jobs
5703001 initially when you hear the announcement from the government you think are they taking positions that might be for local young people or local indigenous people but in all reality thats not the case on the ground
5703002 its fair to say the indigenous community is looking for education and training and long term permanent employment opportunities theyre not necessarily attracted to the horticultural industry picking the fruit those labour intensive entry level jobs
5703003 melbourne day was created to give local residents a better understanding of our rich heritage
5703004 i moved here because of all the trees and the real community feel
5703005 were close to the city but far enough to have some privacy
5703006 this is a fantastic achievement in the history of the rights of women in victoria
5703007 the womans current and future physical psychological and social circumstances
5703008 theres blood on your hands john brumby what about the babies
5703009 to play its full role in the economy the financial sector needs also to mobilise savings putting them in the hands of investors who are in a position to make effective use of them
5703010 banks are in the business of risk management not complete risk avoidance
5703011 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect
5703012 we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5703013 directing and co ordinating the importations trafficking and money laundering activities of the syndicate
5703014 we had a look at the current pursuit course some time ago because it was clear that it was getting tired and we thought there was a better way of testing potential recruits
5703015 weve decided there is a better system based on empirical research which will get fitter more resilient people into the organisation who are fit enough to do a policing role before we begin training them in other areas of the job
5703016 i was a bit surprised by the difference in the ratio but there do seem to be a lot of guys up here in winter and in summer you can tell
5703017 the actions of the current prime minister show signs of high treason and political corruption
5703018 we said last week that tymoshenko systematically works in the interests of the russian side unfortunately this information is being confirmed
5703019 it gives confirmation to them not only about the work theyve done but the quality and also the importance of their work to our city and why they are a critical component of it also what it the decision does is celebrate literature as an important art form and through the centre we will continue to grow that interest and art form
5703020 melbourne is becoming very well known for its creativity this just indicates that we have breadth in the creativity as well
5703021 people believe that learning happens in the classroom but i believe effective learning occurs outside the classroom in authentic real life situations
5703022 they have to see that science is an everyday thing and that knowing science is cool
5703023 they feel like theyre contributing and protecting their local ecosystem
5703024 he was so good at finding the honest truth in anything
5703025 few people have done as much to support the local scene in the last 20 years as chick
5703026 political parties cant get new members churches cant get new members even footy clubs are struggling unfortunately local government is no different
5703027 people are very quick to tell you how stupid you are
5703028 having a child was difficult but no one wins if you give up its easy to give up but no one ends up happy when they do
5703029 the fact that i knew under no circumstances could we have a child it was just impossible
5703030 victorias broad appeal places it ahead of both nsw and queensland overall although many victorians dream of moving up the coast in reality the best quality of life is found in melbournes east and regional areas rate well
5703031 we believe this will fundamentally undermine the policy directions of the state government to increase diversity in the industry and to provide for a fair and transparent competitive bid process
5703032 the absence of such information strongly disadvantages new operators while providing a clear and unfair competitive advantage to current operators
5703033 information about pokie losses at individual venues would enable councils the state government and the vcgr to make more rational decisions about the harm done to victorian communities
5703034 the government has no plans to make further information available as this could prejudice the rights of existing venues and prospective bidders
5703035 given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour confidence was weaker asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect tighter financial conditions were not warranted indeed less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5703036 in his view after the property boom australia had to take a squeeze
5703037 occasionally busloads of migrant farm workers would arrive from oregon fields to take the driving tests administered by dme
5703038 well its dilapidated collapsing on both sides and people drive to the center lane
5703039 its dangerous because cars pass so close to each other
5703040 in the mornings when schools in session kids walk in ditches cars are maneuvering around potholes and its very dangerous
5703041 is well positioned to capture further growth opportunities in the business aviation market
5703042 this acquisition will expand general dynamics franchise as the world leader in high end business aviation products and services
5703043 it is a smart hedge against any post iraq downturn in defence spending and a vote of confidence in the global economy
5703044 i sleep throughout the night but i wake up as tired as i was when i went to bed
5703045 the combination of our two companies will provide additional value and choice for consumers worldwide to better enable and protect their digital life
5703046 by adding pc tools we build on the market leading success of symantecs consumer offerings and firmly position ourselves for continued incremental growth in a rapidly expanding market
5703047 uma desacelera o regular do crescimento do bloco asi tico
5703048 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported
5703049 some critics say japanese mobile technology tends to be quirky like the galapagos islands
5703050 but asian nations such as taiwan and south korea have for years expressed great interest in japanese cell phones
5703051 das wei man erst wenn illegale abbuchungen vom konto erfolgt sind
5703052 vereins zur f rderung des ffentlich bewegten und unbewegten datenverkehrs
5703053 usually you see bait fish on the water you dont see no bait fish nothing nothings there
5703054 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5703055 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5703056 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5703057 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5703058 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5703059 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5703060 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5703061 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5703062 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5703063 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5703064 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5703065 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5703066 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5703067 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5703068 the media narrative thus becomes corsi refuted rather than obama embattled
5703069 obama nation is riddled with pretty much every unsubstantiated rumor you ever heard about obama
5703070 the mainstream press gave the charges carried in ads in books and articles and in major tv appearances a free ride for a spell then a respectful airing mixed with critique before in many cases finally attempting to shoot them down as overwhelmingly exaggerated or false
5703071 we are not judging the credibility of kerry or the swift boat veterans we just print the facts
5703072 self reporting by people who have used drugs as to when they stopped is inherently unreliable
5703073 corsi suggests without a shred of proof that obama may be using drugs today obama has acknowledged using marijuana and cocaine as a teenager but says he quit when he went to college and hasnt used drugs since
5703074 left a trail of wild theories vitriol and dogma that have called into question his credibility
5703075 people from the georgian security agencies asked me to block russian sites
5703076 there were threats from viruses we faced disinformation and so on
5703077 i hope that when war is over we will unblock these sites
5703078 the reason is that they broadcast disinformation during the war that affects our population badly and puts people under stress
5703079 i would not call it media what they broadcast and print is just propaganda and we dont want to scare our population with this disinformation
5703080 when we let them broadcast again we dont know lets see
5703081 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5703082 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5703083 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5703084 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5703085 it came in through all three doors that i have
5703086 whats the good and the bad that can come from this
5703087 it gives students confidence when they can solve problems themselves
5703088 if a parent becomes so enmeshed in the childs life that they cant let go it becomes embarrassing for the child
5703089 its important for kids to know theyre not going to be rescued
5703090 if you go in and try to bully them you give the kid the message that the only way youll get things is to be confrontational and adversarial
5703091 listen to your kids but listen to the other adults in your kids life who are important the teacher the coach the dance instructor
5703092 did you ask other kids in the class if they thought the material was covered adequately
5703093 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5703094 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5703095 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5703096 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5703097 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5703098 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5703099 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5703100 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5703101 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5703102 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5703103 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5703104 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5703105 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5703106 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5703107 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5703108 we can do lots of different things you can be an artist and a psychologist you can be a scientist and religious you can be a sports enthusiast and a scholar
5703109 to create well rounded individuals who are not uni dimensional who can see the world through different lenses
5703110 use every elective youve got to take courses in music and theater and religion
5703111 you will never have another opportunity to have so much expertise in so many fields available to you it will open your mind
5703112 the first year maybe year and a half you can do a lot of exploration
5703113 but you need to begin to focus in most students arent in a situation where they can be on the six year plan or the seven year plan
5703114 i took general education courses and then i took english and psychology and sociology and then i discovered anthropology and that became my passion
5703115 i went to rod stewart concerts buffy sainte marie judy collins
5703116 you can certainly often go hear a lecture or go hear a performance
5703117 the other side of that is if youre a student most of you have more free time than you did during your high school experience figure out a way to give something back do something volunteering wise
5703118 is to think about developing consistent study skills and stress management skills its a big year in peoples lives there are lots of changes
5703119 as you go through the education process you have to realize that you are learning skills
5703120 some of which are transferable to whatever it is you may decide you want to become if you change your mind about what it is you think you want to become now
5703121 take an art course take something you wouldnt normally try nows the time to do it because once you get out into the real working world there arent as many opportunities for that
5703122 ive never seen so many beautiful women in one city
5703123 i mean its like a convention of supermodels out there
5703124 so im just curious when was the last time you uh you know showered
5703125 christ its excruciating to sit next to you at a table
5703126 your only mistake was in not lobbing the basket of stale sweet rolls at his head
5703127 its not whether somebody loves you i mean for all i know o j loved nicole its how he treats you that counts
5703128 then why are you wearing the magenta puppy nightgown of death
5703129 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5703130 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours
5703131 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5703132 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5703133 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5703134 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5703135 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5703136 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5703137 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5703138 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5703139 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5703140 you might have a family thats having a hard time and it might take another day and thats ok
5703141 since youve told me in no uncertain terms that you dont want money from the adult industry i dont want you to have any of my money i would like to close my accounts
5703142 they had details of explosives and poisons along with information about london landmarks and a computer folder on royal residences we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5703143 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5703144 terrorist encyclopaedia or library that would have enabled him or others to carry out terrorist attacks here or abroad in a variety of ways and thereby to further the cause that appeared to be his mission in life the war on western values and anyone who was a non believer in the muslim faith
5703145 if you can find a big target and take it out like a military base in the uk then praise be to allah
5703146 our group is growing we need to plan better and to adapt now a few more people are showing interest we need to confirm and to encourage i want to have a group of at least 12 if possible
5703147 i am not too sure about strapping a bomb to myself anymore
5703148 you need to take care to store them in low temperatures otherwise they can kill they must not come into contact with fire oil or detergent
5703149 perhaps one of the most chilling videos was one that provided a step by step guide as to how to make a suicide bombers vest using ball bearings as shrapnel and demonstrating the effects of such a bomb
5703150 that the attention of the honorable the colonial secretary be called to the necessity of putting a sufficient sum on the estimates to enable the astronomer to carry out his recommendations with reference to the transit of venus in 1874

5703166 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5703167 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5703168 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5703169 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5703170 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5703171 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5703172 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5703173 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5703174 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5703175 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5703176 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5703177 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5703178 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5703179 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5703185 laat saakasjvili maar naar de hel verdwijnen dankzij hem zitten we er zo bij
5703186 wij wilden bij het gemeentehuis noodhulp halen maar er was niks russen behandelen ons nog beter dan onze eigen regering zij delen tenminste nog sigaretten uit
5703187 ja de russen zitten er nog ik weet niet hoe lang nog ze buiten de situatie volledig uit laten ons over elke vierkante centimeter die zij in handen hebben onderhandelen ze willen onze militaire infrastructuur kapotmaken en ook onze economie
5703188 wij wilden de roki tunnel tussen rusland en zuid osseti blokkeren al tijden was dat de weg voor illegale steun aan de separatisten we dachten daarna met de russen te kunnen onderhandelen
5703189 ik had gehoopt dat rusland meteen uit de g8 zou zijn gezet dat er sancties waren gekomen visa restricties noem maar op

5703195 ironwork is generally considered to be the most dangerous of the building trades
5703196 ive been to beijing before but to be here now during the olympics its even more spectacular to be able to enjoy the olympic games its been a fantastic trip
5703197 we were able to see the us basketball team and we got to watch michael phelps win two gold medals and im also gonna go see some gymnastics
5703198 even if youre not a sports fan to be here at the olympics or at any olympics and to see this level of competition and just the athletes you cant help but get caught up in the excitement of it
5703199 ive worked out since i started modelling i always had to workout to stay in shape so for me its just part of my lifestyle and who i am
5703200 nowadays im into hiking and i workout in the gym and running around after two kids help also i think for me the important thing is to keep changing it up so you dont get bored so that youll actually do it because in the end its just about finding something youll do
5703201 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5703202 we anticipated a shortage but we didnt think it would be this significant
5703203 the sport relief mile is a great idea everyone should sign up for their nearest one
5703204 the military advocate generals choice in filing such a soft indictment indicates the idfs feeble response to this incident it send a message to the officers and soldiers that disregarding human lives is acceptable and sets the stage for the next incident
5703205 a mob of nearly 10 15 extremists barged into the church abused the pastor and made false accusations of forcible conversions
5703206 this is a fantastic achievement from all players in the barclays premier league and i am proud to have helped raise such a significant amount of money for this years sport relief campaign
5703207 we come to bear a message of brotherhood and peace for all the people of kirkuk kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
5703208 the issue of kirkuk is very clear there is a constitution approved by the majority of the people of iraq there is article 140 in this constitution related to kirkuk article 140 of the constitution will not be cancelled until all its provisions are implemented
5703209 we believe that the kurdistan region is a region for all kurds arabs turkomans chaldeans and assyrians
5703210 this resolution of the current conflict is first and foremost the responsibility of the people of kirkuk outsiders can only have a helping role however i think there are some external people who are trying to manipulate this internal process to determine the fate of kirkuk for their own ends
5703211 in time bulgaria will not be a country with low salaries but will develop in a way similar to slovakia
5703212 the support has been fantastic and we had five riders with us and we couldnt have done it without them
5703213 i am shortly to do a 250 mile bike ride in israel over five days and have been motivated and inspired by these guys i was terrified but alan and adrian have given me strength
5703214 what an entirely inspirational effort i take my hat off to you both i feel obliged to donate
5703215 i really have to congratulate everyone involved in this yes shearer and chiles are the names we know but lets not forget all the fellas doing it the back up crew and everything congrats to you all keep it going
5703216 im weary to the very core of my being but my backside is not feeling too bad
5703217 you boys are incredible donation on its way i look forward to your arrival on the show later fantastic effort
5703218 as a cyclist myself i take my hat off to them been following progress online and have just made a donation probably would not have given anything but i felt compelled by their efforts
5703219 i am cream crackered now i promise you this is one of the hardest things i have ever done we are on our last legs its been pretty grim at times really tough and we have had to dig really deep but we are nearly there now
5703220 surely as alan and adrian are on a tight schedule the only question is to pee or not to pee
5703221 inspiring stuff and i am about to get the wallet out
5703222 i hope alan has adrian as his assistant in any future management role go on lads brilliant stuff
5703223 has either of them tried to make a break from the pack or do you think it will come down to a sprint finish
5703224 i can promise you one thing we will not be having a sprint finish
5703225 there was a classy moment when we were cycling down the a19 and a helicopter came overhead
5703226 alan shearer blackburn rovers legend adrian chiles keep going big man
5703227 as a man utd fan i never thought i would say this but come on alan shearer
5703228 i feel like my mind and body have been taken to places they have never been before
5703229 it was one of the longest darkest periods of my live
5703230 everyones buzzing they the players dont think we can get beat by anyone
5703231 we are really provoked and motivated to bring home that gold
5703232 we are not far from it two games more and hopefully we can do it
5703233 the 1996 olympics was such a big event for nigeria
5703234 i watched those games like 10 times even after the tournament i had recordings of them and used to play them often
5703235 i dont believe that actually myself i am so close to it if i get that medal i dont know how i ll feel but definitely it is going to be a great feeling
5703236 theres hope from our country and other african countries hoping that we can go and make africa proud
5703237 even when we beat the ivory coast they were saying good luck to us hoping that we can go on and win this
5703238 it would be nice if an african team can win it but there are other teams in this tournament south americans as well so its going to be tough really tough
5703239 es ist sehr wichtig zu wissen wie alt ein mensch biologisch gesehen ist
5703240 doch bisher gab es keine zuverl ssigen und leicht zu bestimmenden indikatoren die uns angezeigt haben in welche richtung dieses pendel ausschl gt
5703241 umso mehr zellteilungen es gab desto lter ist ein mensch
5703242 sehr spannend dabei war dass vor allem bei kranken alten menschen die anzahl der marker deutlich h her war als bei gleichaltrigen gesunden
5703243 dadurch dass kranke gebrechliche alte menschen ein h heres biologisches alter haben lag der zusammenhang zwischen diesem und den biomarkern auf der hand
5703244 sollten sich die ersten ergebnisse best tigen k nnten wir damit einen neuen anzeiger f r sch digungen im erbgut gefunden haben
5703245 im so happy to have helped raise so much money for such a good cause and of course im over the moon to have set a brand new world record
5703246 ive managed to burn an incredible 60 000 calories and slept for just 50 hours in the last 10 days ive also spent more than 108 hours in the saddle
5703247 so im hoping this is going to be a tough one to beat and i get to hang on to my world record for a while
5703248 its colder and theres sharks in it and also the seas a lot rougher so i think its going to be a very challenging swim
5703249 he has started his swim a little bit too early
5703250 the water conditions were extremely difficult it was choppy to say the least so he did really well
5703251 it will be the most intense and testing week of exercise i have ever done but the motivation is absolutely huge
5703252 its not like the olympics where you are doing it for yourself the big motivation is that you are doing it for others
5703253 the point i am trying to make is that africa is not far away if i can get there in a week or so it will show people that these problems are not a million miles away from us
5703254 the best thing about sport relief is that you can help them and get yourself fit and healthy at the same time
5703255 there are many many places where a homeland for the palestinians could in fact take place that would be consistent with their roots
5703256 but there is only one place on earth where the jewish people could have a homeland that is consistent with their roots
5703257 we have a moral obligation to the jewish people to honor the commitment that has been made through decades and decades of understanding that there is going to be a homeland for the jewish people
5703258 the question shouldnt be do arabs have a right to live in jewish territory
5703259 but do jews have a right to live in jewish territory
5703260 to say that jews cant live in jerusalem is the equivalent of telling the boston red sox they cant play in fenway park obviously that would never go over very well on beacon hill
5703261 in terms of the deepest roots and attachment to the land of israel mike huckabee really wins out
5703262 he is more than happy to learn firsthand what actually is going on which is all i ask any political figure to do in america
5703263 i wish that jewish leaders would speak so clearly so unequivocally
5703264 heres a guy who says yes im for a palestinian state and then says but in saudi arabia
5703265 thus saith the lord yet again there shall be heard in this place whereof ye say it is detroyed without man and without beast in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are destroyed without man and without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that say give thanks to the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever even of them that bring offerings of thanksgiving into the house of the lord for i will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first saith the lord
5703266 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word that letter is absolutely clear about what the terms of this are the french as i understand it shared the contents of this letter with russia and so this is a question of why the russian president isnt keeping his word
5703267 georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt georgias economy will be reinforced
5703268 backing up states that might be at risk of being reabsorbed into the russian constellation
5703269 we have an objective in the alliance to reaffirm the support of the alliance for those states that are now well outside of russias reach that is those that have been fully integrated into the transatlantic structures states like the baltic states like poland which are fully integrated members of the transatlantic community and that just shows how far weve come since 1991 and the collapse of the soviet union and certainly how far weve come since 1968 when one of the countries that will be sitting around that table was brutally attacked and its government overthrown by soviet forces
5703270 we are also going to send a message that were not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine and so the alliance will need to consider what it wishes to do to clearly indicate that were not accepting a new line
5703271 this alliance has kept open a road for a strategic choice of russia as friend not adversary but frankly russia cant have it both ways it cant act in a way that it did during the cold war when it was the soviet union and expect it to be treated expect to be treated as a responsible partner as president medvedev outlined in the speech that he made just a few weeks ago
5703272 not because russia is doing favors to the united states but because they are in russias interests
5703273 matter of fact since iran is a lot closer to russia than it is to the united states it certainly doesnt benefit and it certainly doesnt benefit from a middle east that would be roiled by the prospect of a nuclear iran similarly i dont think russia benefits from instability on the korean peninsula or further north korean proliferation nor does russia benefit from the continued difficulty in the levant israel palestine and so forth
5703274 the argument that the release of palestinian prisoners from israeli jails strengthens the moderates has never proven to be correct
5703275 ironically in some cases the released prisoners turned out to be a big headache for the moderate palestinian leadership many of them soon became involved in various criminal activities ranging from armed robberies extortion theft and arms trafficking others later joined hamas and other radical groups and became actively involved in armed attacks on israel during the second intifada
5703276 put the local heroes on its payroll and pay them salaries although many of them were not doing any work
5703277 highly unlikely that abbas would benefit from the release of the prisoners because many palestinians dont give him credit for the move rather these palestinians see the decision as an attempt on the part of israel to improve its image on the international arena and extract political concessions from abbas and his colleagues in ramallah
5703278 the decision is seen by hamas and its supporters as an israeli attempt to drive a wedge between fatah and hamas and deepen divisions among the palestinians
5703279 were quick to emphasize that it was insufficient and that israel must now free all the security prisoners
5703280 we should have had this memorial in front of all the athletes sponsored by the ioc
5703281 this is not an israeli issue this concerns the whole olympic family
5703282 nations that are not willing to condemn terrorism openly or refuse to compete against other nations because of their nationality or race or religion they should not be part of the olympics its contrary to the olympic ideal
5703283 the blackest event in the long history of the olympic games
5703284 athletes coaches and judges of your country who came to the olympic games to compete in peace and harmony
5703285 an event that the world and the olympic movement will never forget
5703286 companies stuff up but those companies who claim they are perfect deny they do anything wrong and have a team of quasi religious loonies believing in it deserve a good kicking when they fail
5703287 my aim coming here was just to get a fight to compete at the olympics ive achieved that ive got a medal now and gone beyond my achievements
5703288 last year even when i qualified for the olympics i didnt really care but now im here and seen the atmosphere and what it means to everybody else its amazing
5703289 it feels brilliant im over the moon im just glad to get that fight out of the way
5703290 das wird sich negativ auf die spielqualit t auswirken das volksgut wird mehr und mehr leiden bis am ende der deutsche profi fu ball auf griechischem niveau angekommen ist er wurde dann kaputt gesch tzt

5703295 i am happy and relieved i was a bit more tense this round the next one for me is a case of see what i can do reaching the semis was a realistic aim i dont think i have ever run sub 23 twice in the same day and that is the big thing for me
5703296 i will try to relax eat and sleep now and just think this is the olympics just enjoy it now
5703297 io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni quello che pensavo non era mai la realt voglio lasciar andare via il dolore che ho provato fino adesso cancellare proprio tutto il dolore io voglio guarire voglio provare sensazioni sentirmi vicina a qualcosa di vero voglio trovare qualcosa che ho voluto fino adesso qualche luogo a cui appartenere

5703311 sinofresh nasal spray used three times daily appeared to effectively eliminate mrsa in the noses of the test animals while leaving enough normal microbes to keep a normal population in the nasal passages
5703312 since bacteria can in effect change their metabolism to be resistant to antibiotics but cant very well change the laws of physics the chances for development of resistance to sinofresh nasal sprays mode of killing them is much lower
5703313 these results have exceeded our expectations the positive results of this in vivo study gives us the solid scientific platform we have needed in order to advance our efforts to fight mrsa to the next level

5703323 were the necessary tools of their trade possessed to be used in furtherance of that violent cause
5703324 we have seen at first hand how people who were our neighbours in west yorkshire became involved in violent extremism resulting in terrible loss of life on 7 july 2005 we need to do more to stop people from taking those first steps into the world of violent extremism
5703325 in some instances it is legitimate for a person to steal for example to eat
5703326 the church does not authorize theft out of mere necessity as has been recently declared in the press but only as an exception and in a state of need that is truly dire and a threat to actual subsistence
5703327 but it is affirmed that a person has a right to procure his subsistence with the means that are possible in an exceptional situation or in a truly grievous state of necessity
5703328 to say that one can steal out of necessity is not a clear understanding of the churchs doctrine and confuses robbery with a state of need which are certainly quite different situations and concepts

5703341 the results are very encouraging as this is a very important first step in the in the development of an effective chimigentm hepatitis b therapeutic vaccine
5703342 the screening for hla b 5701 prior to abacavir treatment allows the identification of patients likely to develop hsr using hla b 5701 tests as a companion diagnostic with the drug abacavir therefore helps to better protect hiv infected patients in treatment from severe additional suffering
5703343 the combination of diagnostics and therapeutics is a key approach to eliminating risks of side effects and therefore increasing the efficacy of drugs
5703344 our new test is another great example for the advent of molecular diagnostic tests which can be used to assess the efficacy of drugs this trend holds great promises for the future enabling doctors to customize therapies based on molecular tests which create molecular profiles of patients or diseases ultimately leads to more medical innovation cost efficiency and most importantly to better and safer treatment of patients
5703345 so far we have only seen the tip of the pharmacogenomic and companion diagnostic icebergs at qiagen we are proud of the roles that our sample and assay technologies and molecular diagnostics franchise contribute to bringing the vision of personalized medicine to reality

5703353 its alarming that so few people with seasonal allergies are spending enough time discussing their medications with their doctors during an office visit

5703500 sehr spannend dabei war dass vor allem bei kranken alten menschen die anzahl der marker deutlich h her war als bei gleichaltrigen gesunden

5703534 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5703535 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5703536 the negative and positive implications of wastewater agriculture have only recently received attention
5703537 this study offers the first comprehensive cross country analysis of the conditions that account for the practice and the difficult tradeoffs that arise from it
5703538 of the large potential of wastewater agriculture for both helping and hurting great numbers of urban consumers
5703539 and it isnt just affluent consumers of exotic vegetables whose welfare is at stake
5703540 poor consumers of inexpensive street food also depend on urban agriculture
5703541 a key aim of iwmi research is to find feasible approaches whereby wastewater irrigation can continue strengthening food security and generating economic benefits but without major health risks for urban consumers and farmers
5703542 improving the management of water and land resources for food livelihoods and nature
5703543 wenn es richtig gemacht wird kann abwasser ohne weiteres zur bew sserung verwendet werden
5703544 die wesentlichste frage ist und bleibt nat rlich welche substanzen sich im abwasser befinden dabei ist es entscheidend ob es sich um haushaltsabw sser oder um industrieabw sser handelt
5703545 in den usa darf frischgem se beispielsweise nicht mit solchen abw ssern bew ssert werden
5703546 in jedem fall sollte die ausbildung und information zu abwasser f r bew sserung verbessert und in entwicklungsl ndern st rker unterst tzt werden da je nach abwasser art der behandlung und anbaukulturen die gesundheitsrisiken stark variieren

5703551 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
5703552 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
5703553 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
5703554 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
5703555 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
5703556 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
5703557 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
5703558 billigautos werden das marktsegment der zukunft sein die steigenden treibstoffkosten haben bei den verbrauchern mittlerweile zu einem radikalen umdenken gef hrt das sowohl die automobilhersteller als auch deren zulieferer vor neue herausforderungen stellt

5703562 even if you have lots of sequence for complex communities it still doesnt tell you which organism is responsible for which function
5703563 this publication presents an approach via simplification and targeted metagenomic sequencing of how you can go after the function in the environment
5703564 to utilize these single carbon compounds organisms employ very specialized metabolism
5703565 we suspect that in the environment there are novel versions of this metabolism and possibly completely novel pathways
5703566 it is very important for metagenomic assemblies to rely on high quality reads
5703567 the doe jgis unique integrated microbial genomics with microbiome samples img m http img jgi doe gov m data management system was used for detailed annotation and was instrumental for efficient comparative analysis and metabolic reconstruction of the samples
5703568 constitute a significant advance in the emerging discipline of metagenomics
5703569 i think other people can use the same approach in different environments as long as they have an enrichment technique
5703570 for us this work is just the beginning because now we will be using this metagenomic sequence as a scaffold for downstream experiments in our lake

5703575 we expect that sales in 2008 will exceed last year due to an increase in oil sands activities and infrastructure development in the fort mcmurray area
5703576 to date we have sold 1 261 000 tonnes more than the same period last year last month alone we sold 1 203 639 tonnes and traditionally summer to fall is our busiest period we already have orders approaching last years total amount the acquisition of ami when completed will provide cash flow and establish a good foundation for abm
5703577 in addition to our gravel properties in the grimshaw area we are actively seeking and exploring for new sand and gravel resources throughout northern alberta for oil sands development roads and highway construction this acquisition is only the beginning of our corporate mandate we will continue to look for other sand and gravel opportunities these potential acquisitions will benefit the growth of the company and propel abm to become one of the leading gravel companies in canada

5703579 fifa have decided that the 2010 fifa world cup preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland scheduled for september 6 2008 will take place at a neutral venue due to recent events in georgia which have affected security in the entire country
5703580 fifa reached this decision after closely monitoring the situation in georgia and taking note that uefa also decided to ask georgian clubs involved in uefa competitions to play their matches in neutral countries
5703581 the georgian football federation has until august 26 2008 to nominate a neutral venue to host the qualifying match against the republic of ireland which will take place on the scheduled date of september 6 2008
5703582 the georgian football federation will serve as the host association for this match

5703607 but this is just our estimate we dont know and even if microsoft and sony told us i couldnt say because it would be under nda
5703608 we wish chandumajra could introspect and categorize himself if at all he was in any category in the sad the same way he has tried to categorize us
5703609 by ensuring a thumping win for the akali dal in the recently held local government elections
5703610 you better ask your alliance partner the bjp how thumping the victory has been and if you would not be satisfied ask thousands of akali workers in the villages who were victimized in the factional fights
5703611 such unfailing loyalty must fetch you the parliamentary nomination this time
5703612 even though we know you hardly stand any chance but that would salvage your prestige which was hurt and bruised so badly in 2004 and you were left with no option but to quit only to return again

5703615 the administration is making sincere efforts for making chandigarh a center of excellence in different sports disciplines including hockey football cricket shooting and so on and special emphasis is being laid for developing the infrastructure in the shooting range and also providing training facilities to the young shooters to develop their competence and capabilities
5703616 god is everywhere and his messengers are in my radio
5703617 roe vs wade is logical if you assume that human life begins at birth and there is a constitutional right to privacy which doesnt allow states to write their own birth control laws but we think the court was mistaken and human life begins when there is a unique genetic entity or brainwave pattern or heartbeat
5703618 we built the 2 1 2 mile entrance road into the area in 2000 and we moved a couple million yards of rock for that project
5703619 we have about 3 2 million yards of rock excavation for the plant site that will be used as fill for the quarry development roads and the harbor is about 1 8 million yards of excavation
5703620 there are some long hauls and we can haul more material longer distances with the 100 ton trucks
5703621 thats what gauges the size trucks we use on different parts of the job
5703622 on a project this size we get more for the money from the 100 ton trucks so its a better value
5703623 to clear the area for the plant site because of the size of the depth of the limestone weve been drilling upwards of 125 feet with the l6h
5703624 the l6h is a 5 1 2 inch diameter downhole drill and it has worked very well weve had blasts of as much as 60 000 yards at a time
5703625 previously we might have had four or five grade checkers running around out here now we dont have any stakes and we dont have any grade checkers because we can do all that from the machine
5703626 that efficiency is a big thing especially on a project this large
5703627 because we sometimes have to make quick decisions to move to another area for one reason or another with gps we can move to a different spot efficiently and effectively with the information we need to begin working there immediately in the old days we would have had to wait for the survey party
5703628 we understood that we were going to begin building things from preliminary drawings
5703629 that was challenging because our design was behind from the outset to overcome that we had to put a lot of thought into the daily operations so that we didnt do things that we would have to go back and do over again we had to be very smart about what we were doing
5703630 it was different than any job we had done before because of the size and scope of the work
5703631 one of our vice presidents dennis underwood was very active in keeping everyone focused on what we had to do
5703632 we had to design the roads to fit the operation and the terrain but also design them to save on the cost
5703633 we designed the roads in house with a consultant to check it
5703634 one of the biggest challenges we had was getting the skilled help we needed and having the operators step up to be able to get the work done
5703635 but were going to walk away from this job with an excellent core group of people who have the experience to handle anything
5703636 bloomsdale excavating has been an excellent partner for us both in the beginning of this project on the construction of our road and now with the site preparation and harbor excavation
5703637 they share the same philosophy as holcim in putting safety first and that is most important for us as we work toward a project free from serious injury to any of our contractors
5703638 were pretty proud of the fact that msha is partnering with us on this project and every msha project we may do in the future
5703639 msha has never done that with a contractor so it says a lot about our safety record and our approach to safety
5703640 to be a part of this project is a once in a lifetime opportunity
5703641 there are a lot of local people working on it and we have many longtime employees working on something they have worked a lifetime to get to
5703642 the objective of this proposed rule is to improve mine safety by significantly reducing the hazard of conveyor belt fires in underground coal mines
5703643 weve always maintained that the mine act says that you cant use belt air
5703644 we believe its a dangerous practice as demonstrated at aracoma
5703645 the miner act calls for nonflammability of the belts thats not whats in the rule or at least thats not whats in the press release
5703646 it means it wont burn to us thats very important
5703647 there is no indication that the proposed rule actually mandates that
5703648 from whence the fuck doth thou think youre motherfucking going
5703649 dean and i are going to take a hiatus from having babies but when we decide to have more maybe i will be able to produce triplets id like that but that would be in the future not right now i am going to have a little break to raise the babies we have but we definitely want more
5703650 the positions range anywhere from hourly employees to management positions
5703651 we feel confident that these folks are going to be able to find employment
5703652 interestingly the client base that got us here which is really the contractors become almost partners in the deal
5703653 traffic patterns have changed were seeing much more of the design community
5703654 it takes a little while before you see back end revenue generation from that
5703655 were trying to better understand how those resources best play out at this juncture we feel strongly this structure will best serve our new strategy
5703656 a significant amount of the restructuring has been about what positions do we need to really elevate these two parts of the brand and what positions are not adding value to those two value propositions
5703657 a handful of the decisions we had to make were purely driven by the housing market
5703658 i want to do everything possible to make sure that everyone responsible for this tragedy
5703659 no no my daquan didnt do that no no my daquan wouldnt do that no no my daquan couldnt do that

5703668 in my practice i see an increase in pediatric asthma patients this time of year as children return to school and become exposed to a new environment with new allergens or irritants that may aggravate their symptoms
5703669 it is important for parents and their childrens physicians to be aware of safe and effective daily treatment options such as asmanex to treat their childs asthma and prevent symptoms before they start
5703670 as the back to school season approaches it is important for parents to monitor their childs asthma symptoms and work with their physician to determine an appropriate asthma management plan
5703671 a once daily treatment is a useful option to help parents establish a regular routine for their children when taking asthma medication
5703672 national asthma education and prevention program expert panel report 3 guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma
5703673 topic of the month august 2005 preparing for school with allergies and asthma
5703674 malawi has made tremendous progress over the years in bringing children back to school
5703675 my appeal to teachers school management committee and parents teachers associations is for you to work together in the implementation of the project so that it yields results
5703676 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
5703677 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california
5703678 i am the pro of the hospital the other nurses call me to put in ivs that they cannot get in
5703679 the spore preparations in the envelope had a specific phenotypic variation that means spores that looked physically different than neighbors
5703680 what genetics allowed us to do was to determine that there are eight samples out there that exactly match the letters
5703681 its like cooking a stew in your kitchen its impossible to get the exact same taste twice in a row simply because of the variations of the material you add
5703682 i have a lot of confidence in the abilities of the fbi and they are proceeding earnestly in disclosing information and should be commended for that
5703683 but given a case of this importance to the country and given that this kind of science has never been used in a court of law before its going to be important to present this scientific evidence to an independent expert review
5703684 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
5703685 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
5703686 they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
5703687 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5703688 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5703689 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head
5703690 i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5703691 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5703692 at this time action is being instigated against the perpetrators of this fraud
5703693 on behalf of myself i can say with certainty matthew whitton and ricky dyer are not the best bigfoot trackers in the world
5703694 by encouraging employees to take part in this program we are tackling preventive health risks at their root by inspiring people to improve and manage their own health
5703695 two of them didnt do anything to us so we just let them go we couldnt take them anywhere as i had to take care of my own men first the third one seemed to be high on something a normal person would have surrendered and this one was shooting at us instead we questioned him and then executed him
5703696 as a young teenager i loved to read and had very romantic notions about what it meant to be writer still my self image didnt leave room for me to even dream about becoming one myself
5703697 when i got the idea to explore the ways in which we continue to define and limit ourselves by our childhood labels i knew i had the beginnings of a novel i would want to read and when i sat down and wrote an experimental chapter and my protagonists voice emerged i knew i had the beginning of a novel i wanted to write
5703698 i think bev the title character in the smart one needs a lot of hours on an analysts couch
5703699 im a morning person and feel like i can do anything if i get a good jump on the day so i wake up around 5 am before the children rise and get to work
5703700 ellen meister has slipped a murder mystery into what might have been a really good book on its own and it packs a one two punch what is even better is the humor sarcastic and witty the interactions of the characters often had me in stitches
5703701 relationships at its core that is what ellen meisters the smart one is about through non stop action and descriptive language that not only puts you in the scenes physically but emotionally meister unravels a spellbinding story with wit and panache
5703702 this book was fast paced and well written although the characters experienced tough and sometimes unlikely situations and spent time talking about a wide range of feelings there was humor wit and an honesty about life that kept it from ever becoming morose or gloomy
5703703 are we destined to live out our childhood labels in ellen meisters new book the smart one three sisters battle to become more than their childhood identities
5703704 the smart one a harperscollins release is a bit chick lit a bit funny and a bit mystery in short it is definitely worth checking out if any of these things are your thing
5703705 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention

5703719 a crucial step in the emergence of self recognition is the understanding that ones own mirror reflection does not represent another individual but oneself
5703720 scientists have argued for decades over whether wild creatures including birds show genuine intelligence some still consider the human mind to be unique with animals capable of only the simplest mental processes but a new generation of scientists believe that creatures including birds can solve problems by insight and even learn by example as human children do birds can even talk in a meaningful way

5703725 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5703726 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter
5703727 many of the internally displaced people who are yet to receive temporary shelter and are thus still living under trees are struggling to seek shelter from the rain
5703728 sri lanka is a unique case of a government maintaining its offices and funding the administration in territories unlawfully occupied by a terrorist group
5703729 plans are under way to settle them in shelters located in safe areas prior to the commencement of the new school term there is absolutely no truth in the reports of internally displaced people living under trees

5703733 if the process is important to you do what it takes to change it not dishonor it when you said you wouldnt

5703741 the northside is an untapped resource we have to get the word out no one should have to travel outside of the district to receive services but spend those dollars right here in the neighborhood
5703742 i commend businesses that choose to open on the northside and the gamble will pay off at the very least its attracting people back into the neighborhood
5703743 it goes far beyond police we have to get neighbors and residents involved
5703744 were always hearing about the negatives some people dont know how well our schools can do what about the north high school graduate who received a gates millennium scholarship and a full ride to concordia university

5703746 right now were working on a community benefits agreement in the bryn mawr and harrison neighborhoods with regards to the bassett creek valley development which is contracted through ryan companies

5703751 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
5703752 i dont like that other people are free to do things i dont like
5703753 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations

5703760 i think the thought is that decriminalizing it will make it somehow less of a forbidden fruit but i think the pattern shows the easier it is to access alcohol the easier it is for students to abuse it
5703761 you move that down to the high schools so that you could have 16 year old and 17 year old kids wanting to get ids that show they are 18

5703805 syms has suspended services as part of preparations for its privatization
5703806 ultimately there needs to be recognition in our immigration program that there are people already in the pacific being displaced because of climate change people having to leave small atolls and islands because of sea level rises
5703807 we think there needs to be a special category in our humanitarian program that recognises the displacement caused by climate change
5703808 im doing it because i want to not because i have to i miss doing it and it scares me im excited by the prospect of doing it and terrified

5703826 a city that hands its police force a license to trash the constitutional rights of its citizens is not a city that is upholding law and order and protecting its citizens on the contrary unlimited police power is a complete breakdown of the law
5703827 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
5703828 such measures also recall the repression by police and private security firms in post katrina new orleans which accompanied the obstruction and expulsion of mostly poor and black residents from their homes
5703829 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution
5703830 democratic and republican politicians are equally responsible for the transformation of civilian police into militias
5703831 the drug war has very little to do with drugs its about control coercion and power its about money america wont get sane drug laws and law enforcement until enough greens get elected to public office to overturn these self defeating unconstitutional policies

5703849 you start out with a mass of material and you have to carve it down to the essentials so you can communicate to an audience
5703850 im excited to share the story of how these people managed to maintain their culture their politics and their art in a new place
5703851 they were suffering 90 percent fatalities from breathing the silica dust

5703860 the disease had features that were not seen before and fortunately have not been seen since
5703861 it is only a matter of a few hours until death comes and it is simply a struggle for air until they suffocate
5703862 it is horrible one can stand it to see one two or twenty men die but to see these poor devils dropping like flies sort of gets on your nerves
5703863 as well as including many old favourites such as the tivoli and the masonic temple we have a number of new venues in the programme these range from rowing club boat houses and the rnli lifeboats to collections of historic books and a synagogue
5703864 i spend very little time looking at the numbers i dont believe any numbers that any entrepreneur puts in front of me i am an accountant you just tell me what you want the numbers to be and i will make them that way
5703865 how google android stimulates the mass market for mobile email and how funambol
5703866 i have received numerous complaints from residents who feel harassed and distressed by the behaviour of some youngsters playing ball games near their homes
5703867 some residents feel abusive language trespassing and damage to their gardens is a step too far and have asked for action to be taken
5703868 the council and the police will look to prosecute in extreme circumstances where warnings about future behaviour are ignored
5703869 kids playing on the street dont bother me one iota i am 77 and if i could i would play on the street
5703870 our director of rugby dai young has been talking to warren to see what wales want to do but jamie has definitely trained at 12
5703871 he is a big strong ball carrying centre but hes also got good foot speed and skills so he is a good choice
5703872 he can cover 15 and wing too but we are just getting him used to playing at 12 with his timing and he is looking good
5703873 if we had won anything there would be pressure to back it up but there are still points to prove in the areas we want to improve on
5703874 we have got to put our heads down because we have got a very tough start
5703875 the most scary thing was the doctors coming at quarter to three in the morning to give us all this stuff
5703876 that was scary and i was thinking gosh i really must be ill
5703877 i didnt think it was the really deadly serious one
5703878 nobody really sat us down and said this is whats happening which i thought was a bit wrong really
5703879 you couldnt go to the shops we couldnt do anything
5703880 we had to rely on people phone people friends and family to actually go and meet the police in the village to transfer whatever we wanted and to bring them up here
5703881 the first diagnosis from the vet was dont worry about it its within the egg chamber and thats why theyre dying so we took no notice until the next week
5703882 when everybody came the next day the police were here defra department for environment food and rural affairs were here the ministry were here yourselves bbc wales were here and i just thought right theres a major problem here
5703883 one of the goals of nrp was to reinvent the way the city delivered services that is yet to be realized working directly with the city we can fulfill that vision
5703884 this department will help the city be more responsive to neighborhoods
5703885 so far as i know the program is the most ambitious of its kind in any large or medium sized american city o nly in minneapolis do those citizens receive such substantial funds to translate their discussions and plans into realities
5703886 in an age when so many people have become disillusioned with government your program clearly demonstrates that empowering people into meaningful opportunities in their own neighborhoods can have a tremendously transformative effect
5703887 support neighborhood organizations strengthen resident involvement in neighborhood and community organizations and coordinate activities between the city and neighborhood and community organizations
5703888 we needed to find a way to sustain it in the long term with a more direct relationship with the city we need to break down the barriers
5703889 it focuses attention of city hall policymakers and staff making sure our relationship with neighbors is close productive and positive the new department will have nrp as one of the programs inside the department but it wont be the only function it will serve as a place where neighbors can interact with the city on a number of issues
5703890 the thing that distinguishes nrp is the level of control
5703891 were talking about real empowerment residents are treated more as equals in the discussion
5703892 the danger of it being a city program is that now the direction is that you get support if you play along but what happens if a neighbor doesnt like the way the city wants to deal with it theres always going to be fear that the funding will be cut off if they become too outspoken
5703893 nobody has explained exactly what the city plan is improving
5703894 it makes neighborhoods subject to the whims of the city council which is a recipe for disaster
5703895 has a fixed amount of money for a longer period
5703896 theres a lot of support to keep the structure like this
5703897 everything is a guesstimate its a grand experiment with nothing behind it
5703898 intends to vigorously defend the claim which it believes to be without merit

5703913 the kids from mississippi creative arts magnet school made all of these
5703914 our teachers have used the trail in teaching the kids about the outdoors but it wasnt until dan came out and said we want to involve you that we could do a project like this
5703915 we thought about a peace garden behind the lorient kmart with the tiles attached to rocks we would bring in
5703916 but we were lost as we began to think about the magnitude of actually bringing in enough rocks and figuring out a way to attach all these tiles the kids made over 300 plates
5703917 as far as i know there are no other community gardens on
5703918 one of my goals is to reduce the kind of petty crime that occurs along that part of the trail to return a sense of community
5703919 the art and the garden are a breath of fresh air in an otherwise fairly industrial setting

5703926 younger union members are the future of the labor movement so its important for them to get involved if youre part of an organization you want to be informed educated and play an active role
5703927 should one take into account the ideology of the authors and editors when choosing course books bearing in mind that youre sending revenue their way

5703951 the melancholy he had been carrying seemed to break him open and the face of his lost daughter was confounded in his heart with the face of the young prince of the khazars it was the business of the world amran knew to manufacture and consume orphans and in that work fatherly love was mere dross to be burned away after long years of blessed absence the return of merciful feelings toward what was after all only another motherless and fatherless child struck amran bitterly as a sign of his own waning powers to live life as it must be lived
5703952 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5703953 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5703954 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
5703955 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5703956 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5703957 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
5703958 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
5703959 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
5703960 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy

5703965 the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project

5703969 known as treebol or tree barcode of life the project will keep track of where tree species are located and whether they are at risk for extinction
5703970 the results are crucial for conservation and protecting the environment as population and development increases
5703971 africas forests are being inhabited by locals where it is customary law to use trees for firewood fell trees for construction and the use of forest products for food and medicine
5703972 as a result many tree species are being listed as critically threatened or endangered
5703973 many tree species may become extinct even before they are discovered if no drastic change in human behaviour occurs and given the predicted climate changes we can expect important modifications to the biosphere within the next few decades which may cause the extinction of a third of species on earth by 2050

5703978 a person who relapses on drugs needs further treatment our responses are research driven
5703979 faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth and god has placed in the human heart a desire to know the truth in a word to know himself so that by knowing and loving god men and women may also come to the fullness of truth about themselves
5703980 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much

5703989 it was hard at first but now i can talk about it freely
5703990 father thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and marginalized
5703991 but he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh the southeastern state where he died
5703992 the church in india is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in this country
5703993 have for decades been at the service of the least fortunate in india and this makes them targets of forces of evil who do not want the marginalized and impoverished to become empowered

5704008 banner across an olympic billboard near the beijing headquarters of china central television to be arrested during the games on a rainy morning in east vancouver the former championship rower and one time olympic hopeful told the tyee how she spent her summer vacation and why
5704009 back in 95 i cycled up into tibet where i fell in love with both the tibetan landscape and the people i also spent three months in nepal where i had quite a bit of contact with tibetans living in exile
5704010 i began to feel connected to tibet where six million people struggle for access to natural resources as well as cultural and religions freedom it became personal for me
5704011 so when china was awarded the games in 2001 it was something that rankled me as a former athlete i felt it was a bad decision to have the games of peace in a country that had such an appalling human rights record and about a year ago i made a decision within myself to actually do something
5704012 we also wanted to send a very clear message to chinese leadership we wanted to say that it takes more than economic might to be a world leader justice and moral responsibility also come as part of that package
5704013 we had some ideas but our plans were flexible because security is so tight over there it really paid to have a couple of options
5704014 there were five of us three americans a brit and myself we flew to china separately and met up in beijing
5704015 we were very careful to stay away from anyone who might have known us or had any association with us we even stayed away from tibetan restaurants or cafes
5704016 its really big it fronted on to one of the really busy freeways in downtown beijing and behind it was the china central television building
5704017 the cctv building is a stunning piece of architecture that has become an icon for modern china of course for us it is also a symbol for how the chinese government uses propaganda to spread misinformation and lies about the situation in tibet
5704018 there were three of us that climbed up the scaffolding it took less than five minutes to get up and hang the banner then i rappelled down the front as did phil kirk kelly osbourne stayed at the top to protect our anchors to make sure we were not cut down like what happened in san francisco
5704019 and we basically just hung out for 20 minutes or so it was a great view
5704020 there were probably 50 police on the scene fairly quickly there were also a couple of international film crews the police tried to stop them from filming the protest
5704021 as soon as the police reached the top of the billboard we all climbed down once we reached the ground we had to hand over our passports and we were put in the back of a military van
5704022 we sat in the back of the van for probably five or 10 minutes it was long enough for me to make a call on a cell phone and do a media interview
5704023 we were taken to a police station where we were split up and questioned they wanted to know logistics how long have you been in beijing did you bring equipment in with you did you get it here are there any others all those sorts of bits and pieces
5704024 we went into this expecting that we would probably be kept for at least three days but apparently the chinese government has been working with a u s based crisis management advisor and now they are moving people out very quickly
5704025 after questioning i was taken to another police station i sat there and watched the olympics on tv with my six guards then i was taken to the airport and handed over to immigration police who escorted me onto a plane home
5704026 i was arrested at seven in the morning and i was on a 4 20 p m flight to vancouver
5704027 when the plane took off i had this wave of emotion wash over me this sense of relief and a sense of appreciation for the four people with whom id spent the past week
5704028 and then i began to reflect on how sharply my own treatment contrasted with what is happening in tibet i know from friends whose families are still in tibet that
5704029 yet i was never handcuffed or shackled i was not harmed or threatened in any way it felt very very unfair what the colour of ones skin and a passport will do
5704030 people of tibetan descent from all over the world were denied visas to attend these games much of the tibetan community that until recently lived in beijing has been moved out and tibet itself is under military law
5704031 so my act as a foreigner was to stand in solidarity with people who were not physically able to speak for themselves at this time
5704032 also i think if someone from inside china had done this they probably would have been treated very differently the lone chinese activist who did actually apply for a permit to protest in the so called protest zone is under house arrest
5704033 i think its a venue i dont think its the only venue
5704034 as a former athlete im strongly supportive of the olympic competitors and im sympathetic to their need to stay focused on their performance but we have to recognize that the olympics have become much more than just a sporting event there are reasons that all these companies pay billions of dollars for broadcasting rights and sponsorship
5704035 do i feel like there are legitimate social issues surrounding first nations in british columbia absolutely you only have to look at their standard of living to see the disparity between indigenous and non native canadians
5704036 would it be fair for someone from china to come and stand in solidarity with first nations absolutely i dont see that theres really a difference
5704037 in five years the idea of broadcast will be gone

5704050 for the male customers replacing the photo of a male with a photo of female on the offer letter statistically significantly increases takeup the effect is about as much as dropping the interest rate 4 5 percentage points for female customers we find no statistically significant patterns overall these results suggest a very powerful effect on male customers of seeing a female photo on the offer letter standard errors however do not allow us to isolate one specific mechanism for this effect the effect on male customers may be due to either the positive impact of a female photo or the negative impact of a male photo

5704065 when obama made his first run for political office articles in both the chicago defender and the hyde park herald featured among his qualifications his position as chairman of the board of the chicago annenberg challenge a foundation where ayers was a founder and guiding force
5704066 the records in question are extensive consisting of 132 boxes containing 947 file folders a total of about 70 linear feet of material
5704067 the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial

5704122 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5704123 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5704124 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5704125 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5704126 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5704128 because when you think about it logically the reason were living longer is because were healthier and if were healthier at any given age then were less likely to be disabled
5704129 all the nursing homes will choke as more and more people spend much more time disabled
5704130 but in reality that hasnt really worked out to be the case
5704131 this is very good news that i can give to some very old people
5704132 i can tell my elderly patients that their chances of being able to take care of themselves 10 years from now is the same as it is now
5704133 as i like to say the older you get the healthier youve been
5704134 so getting to 100 really is a survival phenomenon and people who get there necessarily have to have been disability free not only in their early 90s but pretty much for the vast majority of their lives
5704135 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport

5704152 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5704153 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5704154 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour
5704155 id never given up on the armband and never will do id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5704156 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5704157 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5704158 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5704159 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5704167 im sorry im a very good person but i dont believe the same things you say i should believe im nevertheless scrupulously honest and moral
5704168 youre free to think about these issues any way you wish but i dont want to discuss how my religious beliefs might be related to my policy positions my policy positions stand on their own merit

5704171 this is by no means an ozzfest but the live performance is really becoming a big part of everybodys life the fans and the bands its a healthy situation put the right package together and people will come its very important we work with promoters and keep music alive we all know about the free music downloading thats been pretty crippling to say the least it is a big worry for new bands moreso than anything else for new bands to get signed its virtually impossible because the record companies dont have the funding were better off than most because people still buy our records but for new bands younger bands their material just gets downloaded its just really really tough so how do we turn it around its going to be difficult but the main thing is we keep music alive thats what is important and thats why bands are working together promoters to try and make it all work and its looking pretty healthy this time around in north america we just wanted to put together as good a package as we can for people just for once we wanted to put a good classic line up together and have a really good tour some times weve gone out with younger bands on the bill and it hasnt been the best marriage its great to give an introduction to new bands all the festivals we are doing in europe there are tons and tons of new bands we just wanted to have a really good metal tour

5704177 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5704178 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception
5704179 i have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception
5704180 to accept the fact that after fertilization has taken place a new human has come into being is no longer a matter of taste or opinion it is plain experimental evidence
5704181 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5704187 its not something that you repeat i am patriot there are no specific patriotic activities its got to come across at an authentic and sincere way
5704188 there is a historic suspicion that african americans are less patriotic
5704189 conservative whites look at them blacks as unpatriotic and yet if you look at the constitution and the history the black community has been trying to make that constitution work for everybody

5704195 the previous thinking was that these ultrafine particles went to the lungs and the lungs got inflamed then they generated toxic cytokines and it was the toxic cytokines that caused the cardiac damage our experiments suggest that there actually may be a more direct effect of the particles on the vasculature and the heart
5704196 can decrease coronary blood flow and decrease contractility of the ventricles and weve also seen when you give these acutely you get an increase in arrhythmias
5704197 we think that oxygen radical production by these particles might be important and certainly that they could worsen inflammation and cause damage in the blood vessels and stimulate atherosclerosis
5704198 is it possible for example that patients with coronary disease should take antioxidants on days when there are high levels of pollution i dont know the answer but i know that experimentally at least we have preliminary data suggesting that antioxidants might at least reduce the effect the particles have on coronary flow

5704201 el viaje del elefante dice pilar del r o es un libro coral donde los personajes entran salen y se renuevan de acuerdo con las peculiares exigencias narrativas que el autor se impuso y le impusieron

5704220 el sentido de la norma no es provocar a las comunidades sino resguardar los lugares estrat gicos para la seguridad energ tica pues si estas colapsan afectar a a miles de hogares un tercio de lima podr amos estar en tinieblas por ello las fuerzas armadas en operaci n combinada con la polic a ya resguarda camisea as es que guerra avisada no mata gente

5704237 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

5704294 staff from the law society of scotland and the office of the scottish legal services ombudsman are eligible to transfer to the commission under the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations tupe and the cabinet office statement of practice on staff transfers in the public sector cosop respectively staff consultations are still underway in both organisations and decisions on whether or not to transfer will be taken by the staff involved once this process has been completed
5704295 once the commission is established a harmonisation exercise will take place involving senior management and staff representatives from both former slso and former lss staff who will discuss differences in employment terms and conditions and proposals for their resolution the timing of this harmonisation is for the commission to consider in due course
5704296 there has been significant lobbying from the law society on the issue of their staff transferring to the new commission and the justice department team either dont understand or dont accept the importance of having the former ombudsman staff on board
5704297 it is being seen as vital the profession keep control over regulation of complaints at all levels in the new commission these ombudsman staff cannot be trusted to tow the line if a conflict between the law society and the commission arises

5704306 la caduta di stoner un dej vu del 2001 con biaggi
5704307 non credo proprio innanzitutto tra due settimane c la gara di misano e lanno scorso la delusione fu talmente cocente che stavolta vogliamo dare il massimo per dimenticarla comunque la situazione positiva credo che la gara di laguna seca sia stata molto importante per me e per il team a livello psicologico dopo tre gare in cui stoner ci aveva veramente impauriti ci ha fatto capire che se lavoriamo al cento per cento possibile batterlo la situazione oggi non era come quella vista a laguna questa volta il pi veloce potevo essere io in qualche giro potevo raggiungere casey dopo il warm up abbiamo deciso assieme a jeremy burgess di effettuare una modifica per essere pi veloci in alcune curve in cui perdevamo terreno mi ha chiesto se volevo usarla mi sono fidato di lui e ancora una volta andata bene
5704308 s ha perso lanteriore nella esse dopo il primo rettilineo di ritorno stava forzando secondo me era gi un po in difficolt
5704309 ho tirato un sospiro di sollievo mi aspettavo una gara difficile come quella di laguna seca ero carico pronto alla battaglia ma poi ho visto una moto rossa scivolare e da l stato tutto pi facile e stato come un dej vu come nel 2001 vale si riferisce alla caduta di max biaggi allepoca sulla yamaha vestita di rosso marlboro ndr sette anni fa fu determinante per il titolo ora invece non lo sappiamo anche perch stoner arriver a misano molto carico come uno che non ha niente da perdere
5704310 s perch significa che se perdo arrivo comunque secondo la differenza rispetto agli altri piloti effettivamente imbarazzante dopo pochi giri avevamo gi un sacco di secondi sugli inseguitori anche perch stoner tira come un matto da subito a mio parere i piloti che possono stare con noi sono pedrosa e probabilmente lorenzo quando avr pi esperienza ma attualmente hanno problemi con le gomme va poi detto che questanno kawasaki e suzuki non sono al livello di yamaha e ducati mentre la honda non ha le gomme giuste
5704311 dopo un risultato cattivo era facile dire che avevo sbagliato io per ero sicuro di aver fatto la scelta giusta anche perch nel 2007 ho assistito a certe cose che mi hanno fatto capire sapevamo che sarebbe stato difficile a inizio stagione come del resto stato fino al portogallo ma in seguito le nostre gomme sono andate sempre benissimo
5704312 piccole cose di elettronica per migliorare in accelerazione e anche gomme
5704313 mah io ero favorevole gi lo scorso anno e se lo introdurranno per me non c problema anche se ora sono dalla parte giusta per ora almeno posso dire che sono problemi loro per una questione di comodo potrei dire che preferirei che rimanesse tutto com ma forse per lo spettacolo meglio il monogomma
5704314 beh bisognerebbe chiedere ad ago che sensazione prova a parte gli scherzi lui rimarr sempre il pi vittorioso di tutti i tempi con 122 vittorie ma raggiungerlo in quanto a vittorie nella top class quasi mi fa commuovere
5704315 no credo che un pilota non pi sicuro di s avrebbe iniziato il weekend di brno faticando invece casey sempre stato un martello caduto perch non voleva arrivare secondo e vedendo che non riusciva a distanziarmi pur spingendo ha provato a cercare altri due tre decimi che per non cerano

5704354 we were never informed as to exactly what we were being given we also did not sign any informed consent prior to the testing this was a direct violation of the geneva convention rules for the use of humans in chemical and drug experiments research

5704362 more than thirty years have passed since outdoor live agent chemical tests were banned in the united states and the last outdoor test with live chemical agent was performed so much of the infrastructure for the field testing of chemical detectors no longer exists or is seriously outdated the currently budgeted improvements in the t amp e infrastructure will greatly enhance both the developmental and operational field testing of full systems with better simulated representation of threats and characterization of system response
5704363 it is clear they will be engaging in field trials not in test chambers of full systems which means live cb agents not simulants
5704364 current t amp e shortfalls lie in the full systems and platform test chambers and supporting instrumentation and fixtures these test fixtures must be able to introduce and adequately control live cb agent challenges and provide a range of environmental and challenge conditions to simulate evolving threats while performing end to end systems operations of cbd equipment
5704365 a range of environmental and challenge conditions in a test chamber

5704371 the departments involved were not communicating with each other only the people who handled the agent knew anything
5704372 i thought this was very unfair to the pentagon police and other innocent bystanders who didnt need to be kept in the dark about this how could they conduct an open air test of a microbe and not tell people what it was up front
5704373 the data will help the pentagon and arlington shape their lockdown policies for chemical and biological attacks or accidents

5704487 it depends on the market but youve got to go where your customers are
5704488 i bought their argument that if you have something to say this is a good way to say it
5704489 and i felt like it was a good way to get more conversational with the market not just our customers or potential customers but everybody who has an opinion on the market
5704490 we invested the time and energy on day one creating a blog on a separate domain that would give us a platform to talk publicly about issues that we think are relevant

5704545 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals

5704550 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5704551 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5704552 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold
5704553 i have four medals now and im tied with my dad one gold two silvers and a bronze and i have one more chance to get one gold that i feel like i missed out on today

5704560 i tell everybody what happens is people go on reality shows and regret what they did but nobody makes you do anything youre free to be whatever you are then they want to blame the network that makes no sense
5704561 im still optimistic i definitely think it could happen for somebody but unfortunately some people like tailor made pull out because theyre not used to having the fame
5704562 honestly i have to say ever since i was a little girl i wanted to be an actress being in front of the camera felt so natural
5704563 thats a different league right there a whole different ballgame thats whats so exciting to me about acting you have to work extra hard at it

5704567 thats a different league right there a whole different ballgame thats whats so exciting to me about acting you have to work extra hard at it
5704568 yeah thats absolutely true but it just goes to show that life is very unpredictable i think the truth is that people end up in the most unlikely situations you can be around someone for years and not know you have chemistry with them charlotte and cooper have been in this professional environment never knowing that they have a similar proclivity if you will and where thats leading is really just wonderful im really thrilled

5704576 chaput is one of the most respected leaders of the catholic church in america
5704577 his record is a strong commitment to social and economic justice and the principles of the catholic faith hes also a strong patriot
5704578 pro life democrats who are proud catholics like myself feel this is an insult to our values
5704579 should be aware there are strong pro life people who are politically successful
5704580 im happy to see they are having prayer at their sessions
5704581 and they have a right to choose whom they want to do that
5704582 they will know being catholic is more foundational to their identity than anything else
5704583 render unto caesar serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
5704584 i am trying to convince people they should not be embarrassed at being catholic and not buy the supposedly american notion that people should shelve their faith when they enter the public square
5704585 have historically belonged in huge numbers to the democratic party
5704586 they could have stood up in former years and demanded that abortion not be part of the platform but they did not

5704603 hes converting from basically being a down end to a stand up outside linebacker
5704604 theres a transition there that happens the longer he is here and the more comfortable he gets with the system hes going to be fine
5704605 theres been some times where you see the pass rush ability the raw power
5704606 when youre doing it for the first time its all new and its just a lot of stuff to process you keep chipping away at it and eventually the fog clears and things look a lot better
5704607 same side of the body and same leg but not the same injury
5704608 i spent some time this weekend getting treatment on it and hoping that it responds quickly like it usually does
5704609 the key is not to go out there and aggravate anything when im not ready to go
5704610 im trying to get treatment this week and im feeling better every day its going to be up to coach what he wants to do i think hes been coaching long enough to know that the first game in september is the most important game for us
5704611 one thing you talk about with preseason im looking at is the ability to move your feet get in and out of his backpedal his release
5704612 im looking at does he have the arm to get it where hes supposed to
5704613 ive seen that im not discouraged by what his passer rating is or his stats are or anything like that
5704614 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5704615 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to happen
5704616 i look forward to our time together and being able to kind of get on the same page i know he has been studying the offense and trying to get the mental reps even though he hasnt been in there physically now well have the opportunity for him to run some full speed routes me throw to him get a feel for body control body language all that stuff is important for quarterbacks receivers tight end relationships

5704622 it was a big setback for wagner and one that could end his season instead of forearm stiffness he has an elbow issue and is headed for more tests on tuesday
5704623 its a little odd that none of this occurred until his simulated game but one front office source i spoke with said that wagner probably didnt really let the ball go until the simulated game
5704624 im still not convinced thats the only problem especially since wagner actually expressed relief that it wasnt bone chips if theres any positive sign its that wagner didnt have a sudden loss of control

5704801 people are always asking me about the risks associated with eating pork and pork by products there are multiple references all around the world as to the dangers of eating pork being in practice for many years i have firsthand experience in what occurs when someone stops eating pork and all pork by products over the years with virtual 100 percent certainly i can tell you that when my patients go off pork they virtually always feel much better have more energy and their symptoms whatever they may be start to disappear as if by magic ironically if they start to eat pork again their symptoms reappear their energy level plummets and the feeling general malaise takes over one of the greatest risks in eating pork in an unknown one it is a retrovirus called porcine endogenous this retrovirus lives in all pork cells scientists have no idea how this retrovirus affects humans what is known is that these viruses survive heating and cooking even at extremely high temperatures over long periods of time if you are not familiar with what retroviruses can do think of aids the symptoms that come from aids are associated most often with retroviruses retroviruses use the bodys own cells to replicate themselves this means that retroviruses go undetected for many many years as they spread throughout the body brown university reported that retroviruses pose a significant threat to the public when a person eats pork on a regular basis theyre loading their body with these retroviruses these retroviruses dramatically reduce the bodys ability to fight off disease suppress the persons immune system and make the consumer of pork more susceptible to disease as well as creating a general overall malaise when a person goes off pork for thirty days they almost always have an increased sense of well being a heightened sense of awareness a high level of consciousness are much happier smile more laugh more sleep better and whatever physical symptoms they have almost always those symptoms diminish or vanish eating pork causes many problems including hormonal imbalances joint and back pains inflammation excessive histamine production headaches increased susceptibility to colds and flus as well as potentially being partially responsible for degenerative disease such as arthritis heart disease and caner from what ive personally observed i believe eating pork is like vaccinating your body against health pigs also harbor many other toxins are latent with diseases and contain worms most flu viruses that we encounter in the united states come from the lungs of pigs that create an incubator for the combination of bird human and porcine viruses the center for disease control has stated that as many as 200 of these combined viruses make their way from southern china to the united states each year through pigs pigs scavenge and eat anything in their path including dead insects worms rotting carcasses rats their own feces garbage and other pugs whatever a pig eats turns to meat on its bones within a few hours pork is virtually undigested garbage pork causes stress in the body both physically and emotionally and gives rise to physical poisoning this is a fact that is well known in the scientific community it is obvious to everyone that when pork products are not prepared properly sickness can result in their consumption however this also applies to all pork products including cured meats such as ham and bacon smoked meats sausages etc when someone consumes a freshly killed pork product instant symptoms develop including acute inflammation of the appendix and gallbladder colitis intestinal problems gastroenteritis typhoid eczema various forms of abscesses spasm etc these symptoms are also observed in people after consuming any pork product including salami bacon sausage and ham as i mentioned flu viruses in pork live in the lungs a professor at the london institute for virus research states that flu viruses remained alive and active and were found in sausages hot dogs ham bacon pork chops virtually all pork products this means that the fly viruses and other viruses that live in the lungs on pigs and in the tissues of pigs survive the cooking and preparation process when you eat any pork product you are eating living dangerous viruses additionally pork is the primary sources of the taenia solium tapeworm this type of parasite spreads throughout the body one in six americans has triginosis and gets it from eating pork like most parasites these go undetected for years and years and years these parasites steal nutrients from our cells and promote inflammation and degeneration within all tissues they help create an environment that is conductive for caner diabetes heart disease arthritis as well as indigestion gas bloating acid reflux fatigue and depression so whether its the retroviruses the parasite tapeworms the flu viruses the histamine increasing compounds or any of the other toxins present in pork you may want to consider why you would ever gamble with your health by eating pork from confucius to moses to muhammad to present day science and research pork has always been and continues to be a very risky health choice it may be the other white meat but its definitely not the right meat

5705031 this will reduce the amount of additional traffic in this area by half
5705032 no one will like to live on this peninsula in the future when we have all this extra traffic unless we do something about it now operation stack and congestion on the orwell bridge add more problems the infrastructure is appalling

5705053 these prophets were the men to whom we granted the book and
5705054 that he who would perish might perish in clear evidence of
5705055 that with which i commanded you to obey me and obey my messenger and the people of authority and to refer disputes to me and my messenger is better for you in this life and in the hereafter it leads to your happiness in both lives therefore it is best and most rewarding for you

5705069 we are not only seeing a significant increase in cds being purchased but also more investors are waiving the interest on their cd in order to increase the amount by which the borrowers monthly loan payment is reduced
5705070 not only does zopa offer great rates on loans and cds but because of our relationships with the credit unions our members have access to other great product offerings such as high rate checking accounts and low rate mortgages and auto loans
5705071 my response to that its interesting because at different phases i can have different takes on it one is like well isnt that the whole idea the country is based on we can express this and that its all kind of business as usual its strange to me were taking flack from a disabilities support group with all the other archetypes and stereotypes we tended to address and lampoon and al that nothing is above satire last i checked

5705079 the low permeability of the qinnan block can be a great complement to our high permeability shouyang block as netherland sewell has previously noted higher permeability allows wells to maintain their production rates for longer time periods enabling higher gas recoveries from wider spaced wells and that is why we have been so focused on concluding the heavy lifting in shouyang yet while qinnan is likely to have lower permeability nevertheless some of the best producing coalbed methane wells in china to date with some horizontal wells reportedly producing up to 3 million cubic feet of gas per day have been drilled to the south of our qinnan block in areas of similarly low permeability thus we are eagerly awaiting the results of our testing program on this horizontal well moreover our first horizontal well in the qinnan block confirms that horizontal wells can be drilled at a low cost in the area we engaged a chinese company on a turnkey contract to drill this well at a total cost of approximately us 1 3 million based on these drilling costs and other results in the area we believe the qinnan block could potentially provide very attractive rates of return
5705080 overall we have significantly ramped up our drilling operations immediately prior to completing the qinnan horizontal well we had six rigs drilling simultaneously as we speak we have two rigs drilling two deviated wells in yunnan province one rig drilling a parameter well in qinnan to identify further prospective areas and three rigs operating in the shouyang block we expect the horizontal well underway in shouyang along with the deviated well being drilled there and the one recently completed to further shorten the time it takes to reach the critical desorption pressure at the shouyang block therefore we have begun preliminary discussions regarding off take alternatives for potential gas from the shouyang block as well as construction of a compressed natural gas facility to process gas

5705441 gmac global relocation services performs consistently well in all of the factors that drive transferee satisfaction and its service philosophy which involves listening to customer needs and committing to agreed upon service levels has been key to its high levels of achievement for two consecutive years
5705442 prudential relocation demonstrates particular strength in the ability of their relocation counselors to address transferee problems in a timely manner across the industry approximately one third of transferees experienced some type of problem during their relocation and the majority of those transferees who experienced a problem contacted their relocation counselor for assistance in resolving it therefore having counselors that are well equipped to handle problems that arise and aid transferees is a great asset
5705443 the relocation process can involve coordinating a myriad of services a task that a transferee may have to take on if a corporate relocation company fails to proactively manage the relocation
5705444 when corporate relocation companies take control in ways that maximize convenience for transferees such as arranging service in an efficient manner and minimizing the number of contacts that a transferee must deal with they considerably improve transferee satisfaction

5705451 coal river mountain can accommodate 220 two megawatt wind turbines enough energy to power over 150 000 homes
5705452 you cant put wind power on a strip mine because the wind patterns are impacted and the land is rendered unstable for supporting wind turbines
5705453 were optimistic about the potential for local leaders to support this project and put raleigh county on the map this would be the biggest wind farm proposed on the east coast and could provide a model for other counties in west virginia looking for affordable clean energy and safe healthy jobs in their own communities
5705454 i live in the west end of the county which has been heavily impacted by coal mining
5705455 our concern today is our homes our environment and the sustainability of the environment the house i live in and raised my children in which my husband built and he is buried in the family cemetery next door would be in danger from this mine the wind farm would preserve the mountain
5705456 economic development is of the utmost importance but concern for the well being of citizens is a priority this wind farm could save local communities peoples lives and our way of life while also bringing new economic development to the area this idea is an excellent alternative and maybe the only alternative for our lands which are being permanently destroyed
5705457 the national conversation on energy and global warming makes it clear that america needs to start investing heavily in renewable energy as well as get ourselves off foreign sources of energy carbon taxes could make coal more expensive in coming years and west virginia needs prepare itself by developing innovative affordable new sources of domestic energy before that happens

5705614 there are two directions you can go with this research
5705615 some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who arent interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide
5705616 surprisingly the importance of religion to teens had very little impact on their educational outcomes

5705738 hopefully the left will challenge this anything that keeps mccains heroism front and center without a shred of evidence from any eyewitness that hes lying is tantamount to an in kind campaign contribution more please ill make you follow the link for swindles assessment of the naysayers hes right too about the guards and their associates occasionally showing compassion bob owens googled around to see if he could corroborate mccains story and stumbled upon a similar incident involving former pow and gop senator jeremiah denton the dumbest part of all of this aside from the fact that the nutroots is pushing it into the mainstream media where itll redound to mccains advantage and dirty st baracks hands by association is that if he was going to make up stories to prove his devotion while in prison surely he could do better than this i remember some lefty at tnr i think noting quite rightly after mccains christmas ad came out that the specifics of it really are more a testament to his captors faith and humanity than to mccains if maverick wanted to dazzle believers with evidence of his own grace under pressure hes got material to work with but then this is a guy whose son was stationed in iraq and yet who almost never mentions that fact on the trail even though it gives him moral cover in his push for a sustained troop presence anyway rock on nutroots
5705739 john mccain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that i find personally really surprising and frankly upsetting
5705740 this is a different john mccain this is not the senator john mccain this is want to be president john mccain
5705741 and the result is that john mccain has flip flopped on more issues than i was even ever accused possibly of thinking about
5705742 if you like what has happened to oil prices john mccain is going to continue that policy if you like what you see about health care john mccain has no health care plan
5705743 i would have at least expected the john mccain that i knew back then to realize what almost every person in the pentagon has admitted
5705744 that says theres no violent history between sunni and shia thats wrong his judgment that says this is going to increase the stability of the middle east it hasnt its made it less stable the judgment that says quote this will be the best thing for america and the world in a long time its the worst thing that weve done in a long time and hes turned his focus away from afghanistan and al qaeda and made america less safe thats dangerous for our country
5705745 as we prepare to face off with whomever the democrats select as their nominee that we all follow johns lead and run a respectful campaign focused on the issues throughout the primary election we saw john mccain reject the type of politics that degrade our civics and this will not change

5705801 oh human life we would like to value it but if theres no profit in it whats the point
5705802 i could play a little guitar because my brother taught me so i taught tim to play the guitar and john the bass
5705803 we had trouble finding a drummer i think gary joined in 1984 he made a big difference because he was technically much better than the rest of us at that time just after punk when the first rough trade records came out it didnt seem very important to us to be technically proficient it never did
5705804 she had a very forceful way of putting her arguments nobody in the opposition really had an answer to her thats why she kept winning elections in fact to find a good answer to the tories you had to go to the root of the matter thats what got me interested in marxism
5705805 we sent our record to a record label called pink they signed us up and started to get us gigs after c86 and red sleeping beauty it was always easy to get gigs even abroad i loved playing in other countries people were always very kind to us
5705806 we were very lucky to be on the c86 cassette its what first got us attention musically we were pretty similar to those bands i think our general attitude was a bit different though
5705807 gary did the drums although tim and i used to give him suggestions i put the lyrics on last some of the songs i wrote on my own like frans hals
5705808 but i still think a lot of them are quite pertinent and funny although naturally i wouldnt say the same things the same way today not because ive changed my mind but because the world has changed the other members were always very supportive they agreed with the general tendency in my lyrics i think i had a few big arguments with gary about politics but generally we were all on the same wavelength
5705809 i dont remember saying that and im not sure if i agree today we were only a little group but we got quite a lot of attention in the beginning all we aimed at was to make a record and play some concerts everything else was a bonus
5705810 we didnt re record the songs because we disliked the originals
5705811 some of the songs on the second album were badly done i prefer the first and last albums we were very happy with we are all bourgeois now the song the manic street preachers covered and some of the songs on the last album were quite well done i think i like i worked my self up from nothing we could have recorded most of the songs a lot better though i dont think i was a very good singer either to be frank
5705812 who destroyed our industry who can tell me that the germans swamped the market with their german products
5705813 if possible herzfelds records were even more badly recorded than mccarthys records i tried to use keyboards as well as guitars they werent very dance orientated however it wasnt that different from mccarthy
5705814 i think the others would have carried on a bit longer i didnt want to though i had the impression at the time that wed reached a plateau in terms of audience and our songs and we werent advancing we could naturally have carried on repeating ourselves over and over again but that would have been terrible plus although there werent any tensions between us the fact that laetitia had more or less joined the group for the last tour did break up our former cohesion a little bit
5705815 im glad we stopped when we did i think pop music is basically for young people and not for fifty year olds i know some fifty year olds do carry on but its hardly ever a good idea
5705816 john and tim thought they werent good enough to go on the compilation thats all very well but released by cherry red in 1996 one was called who will rid me of these turbulent proles i was really pleased with it it was one of my best lyrics its recorded but not mixed unfortunately so its a bit rough the other was a joke disco song that tim did its called you had to go and open your big mouth laetitia sings a few lines on it we had very long titles towards the end its in a fairly rough condition too
5705817 im afraid i dont know the manic street preachers very well although ive heard the two songs charles windsor and we are all bourgeois now of ours theyve done of course i cant see too many groups with the same kind of attitude as ours but perhaps i just dont know them
5705818 i buy classical records sometimes i like bach very much my wife bought the last madonna album so i had to listen to that quite a lot
5705819 the book is about a woman who discovers an unusual amount of dog mess all over the town where she lives she spends the book trying to find out why theres so much of it and where its all coming from this was partly inspired by life in paris which is certainly the dog mess capital of the world although naturally they dont mention this in the guide books
5705820 i like bertholt brecht jaroslav hasek karl marx shakespeare and diderot a lot
5705821 yes although i try to develop my opinions in interaction with what is going on around me it would be foolish to carry on repeating what was said fifteen years ago since the world has moved on i dont know if you have extreme left wing parties in sweden but the mistake they make in france and britain is to carry on repeating the old line as if the world hadnt changed out of recognition in the meantime
5705822 i think today the most important thing is to stand up for politics in a general sense the idea that people can change the world i have nothing in common with the people who demonstrated in seattle for instance i dont think they want to kick the world forwards but kick it backwards theyre not really in favour of progress or reason quite the contrary if i wrote songs today they would be taking the piss out of homeopathy environmentalist doom mongering animal rights and standing up for reason and the human race
5705823 we wont use cash no no no we let no cash soil our hands
5705824 almost all of the mccarthy songs are sung by a
5705825 we didnt get very much im afraid we all signed on the dole and used the mccarthy money to buy books and records and so on we never got any advances from anyone but i still get a little bit of money today because cherry red re released all our albums but as you might imagine this isnt much the money we should get from the manic street preachers cover will certainly be a lot more than anything from our own records
5705826 this is a highly unlikely scenario i think youll agree i think its a bit sad when old groups get back together the sex pistols the buzzcocks the beatles etc people do these reunions either for money or else to relive their lost youth i should say either way its a bit pathetic

5705983 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness
5705984 theirs was a new york love a checkered taxi ride burning rubber and like the city their passion was open 24 7 steam rising from their bodies like slick streets exhaling warm moist white breath through manhole covers stamped forged by delaney bros

5705990 why mr pervez musharraf is being provided with the opportunity of safe exit
5705991 if its a safe exit for musharraf today there will be a safe entry for another dictator tomorrow
5705992 it is about being different in an increasingly crowded cookie cutter market
5705993 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent
5705994 illegal file sharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners

5705999 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5706000 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5706001 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5706002 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5706007 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5706008 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5706009 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
5706010 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear
5706011 wishing i didnt have to spend most of my sunday at the office

5706047 we even had other satellite operators calling us and wanting to buy our slot

5706098 it was my first olympics and i never even dreamt that i will come this far reaching quarterfinals was most overwhelming i know i am playing well and i have learnt how to sustain and maintain myself by seeing the international players in the beijing olympics village
5706099 i hope i will be able to get gold in the next olympics which is my main aim now
5706100 i cant blame coaching or anything for that matter i was hasty during the match if i had played like i played in pre quarterfinals i would have definitely reached the semis it was my mistake

5706393 in 2004 the un body ruled that the case against medell n should come under judicial review and reconsideration as the defendant had not been allowed to request consular assistance from the mexican authorities after his arrest under the terms of a 1963 international agreement anyone arrested in a foreign country has the right to assistance from a representative from his or her home nation

5706400 things could have been better if georgia and russia just sit and talk regarding south ossetia until such time solutions can be found but georgia went beyond what is better by starting the war georgia is wrong and should be criticized
5706401 when will war end modern russia has now shown itself as no friend of peace its a big fat playground bully beating up the nerdy little kid to hell with russias leaders georgia wants to integrate itself with nato and the eu and the west because the west allows countries to speak their own language be themselves as well as prosper russia just wants everyone to speak russian and get rich quick while letting corruption and public infrastructure go to waste russia has already swallowed so many cultures and peoples dont let them swallow the georgians too

5706719 thats abraham lincoln he was president of our country a long long time ago
5706720 well landon someone actually shot him with a gun thats why mommy tells you guns arent safe
5706721 maybe the person who shot him wanted to be president maybe thats why he shot him
5706722 no ellie there hasnt but we got really close this time around there was a woman running for president this time who got really close to the end of the contest

5706735 i havent seen julia in almost six months she stopped our visits after i finally cut off her prescription
5706736 in all good conscience i should have stopped a long time ago but you know julia
5706737 she must have found another way to get it after she left my care thats why i was so surprised when you called about her to be honest i almost didnt take your call im rather amazed at myself for even meeting you here
5706738 its just that well i thought i was done with the horror of julias life
5706739 first of all julia doesnt believe she has a problem
5706740 she doesnt have enough support for a traditional intervention her parents havent talked to her since her marriage
5706741 she doesnt have any siblings and she never mentioned any close friends at any of her sessions in fact youre the first person ive talked to that has shown any concern for her at all
5706742 i truly believe if i hadnt pushed her to take the job at the social service office shed still probably be sitting at home alone derek shuddered at the thought of julia with the pills alone with her addiction and the horrors of her life whatever they may be rolling around in her head julia alone in her apartment she could be dead now and no one would have known it christines voice broke him from his reverie yeah okay
5706743 derek if i may say julia is lucky to have you in her life
5706744 well i havent slept much since monday and i was wondering if sleep deprivation can cause hallucinations
5706745 after julia was taken to the hospital i found myself standing outside her apartment door i really had no intention of going there it was still on me when i got home i had to wash my clothes he warned me to stay away from julia that he marked her as his and when i turned to tell him to fuck off there was no one there just a golf club leaning in the corner
5706746 it had a bent handle and well blood on the head im certain it wasnt there when i walked up the stairs
5706747 when i left the apartment i looked up at her bedroom window sure i had just imagined everything but the word slut was written in red in blood on the window
5706748 i thought we were trying to get her off the drugs
5706749 but given her already fragile state any shock to hr system could cause more harm

5706862 people arent trying to get out of any particular varieties or any apples if thats the perception out there
5706863 the land has to stay available for agricultural production for five years but it doesnt have to be orchard some are doing trees others are looking at grains and corn for the ethanol or vineyards
5706864 they are all eating apples new high value cultivars and we need markets for them
5706865 its very scary to make these investments not knowing if the public is going to be there but i think they will
5706866 theyve gone from maybe 120 a bin for the old varieties to 500 or 600 for honey crisp theres a lot more work and the cost of production is more but there is still enough to make a margin and reinvest that in the orchard
5706867 if there wasnt a program growers would still be replanting their orchards
5706868 its business if i had the money id take 5 000 trees out well do what we can
5706869 dean and i are going to take a hiatus from having babies but when we decide to have more maybe i will be able to produce triplets id like that but that would be in the future not right now i am going to have a little break to raise the babies we have but we definitely want more

5706871 as shoppers tighten their belts they are now looking more carefully at premium food prices and questioning why they should pay more for a particular product we know that they will pay more for a better tasting or healthier product but they will not pay more simply for fancy packaging

5706879 the russians are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since joseph stalin
5706880 the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries
5706881 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate

5706898 did you think at the time when you said that did you think he was in the cone of silence did you think he was in the building
5706899 i also told senator obama since there was one question where i was going to ask for a commitment it was the commitment later about would you allow a pepfar type presidents emergency plan for orphans and i thought if i was going to ask them for a public commitment i ought to let him know in advance i got to tell barack obama that in advance i did not get to tell john mccain that in advance it caught him by surprise im sure
5706900 es lamentable que zapatero se esconda y no quiera comparecer en el congreso para hablar de financiaci n

5706912 hey admit it or not there are some guys who will kill again if theyre allowed to live you cant hold them in the prisons especially when you have liberal hippies running around unleashed struggling to come up with new excuses every year for releasing criminals from prison
5706913 waitaminnit how can you say killing is wrong and then prove it by killing someone
5706914 when you think about the way people treat each other in africa about witchcraft and people inflicting cruelty and pain on each other then come back here and you know people taking pictures of people when theyre in their homes being taken to hospitals or suffering and selling them getting energy from them thats a terrible infliction of cruelty so whos worse off you know what i mean

5706939 a brand new multi media theater experience that is above and beyond the stage
5706940 we come from different disciplines within the arts including film physical theater and traditional theater combining these different perspectives always gives our audience a a unique theatrical experience its not traditional theater and many times sparks new conversation with this is the place of parting we are dealing with the meaning of life while taking the audience on a real wild ride
5706941 itll be the sort of thing that only live theater can deliver a compelling story with outrageous spectacle right before your eyes no one will fall asleep in this one
5706942 quinn burmester and maloney have brought to life a powerful new piece that deserves a longer run and as much attention as it can grab
5706943 we are going to each town to introduce ourselves and share what we do with the local community the audience that comes to this world premiere will have a direct effect on how the play evolves the goal is to tour the show to new york and to festivals around the world

5706945 all they got was a good description of what we have
5706946 im not aware of us ever giving them a dollar figure
5706947 we didnt ever get far enough along for incentive letters or anything
5706948 we never got far enough along for formal action on the state or the county side
5706949 further support the proof of principle for autologous cell therapy and opens the door for future research of the therapy in aesthetics acne scars burn scars and other clinical applications as the future evolves and current therapies continue to show their age the need for novel skin rejuvenation products becomes evident
5706950 we have several options open to us now that we have the clinical trial data
5706951 we havent decided yet what one is the best option for us
5706952 as ever in these situations it is impossible to please 100 of the people all of the time and we recognise there are elements of our supporters who would like the opportunity to smoke at games
5706953 in time we would like to move the stadium to a smoke free zone but this allows us to introduce that measure in stages and we believe that is better for our supporters inside the ground as a whole
5706954 the draw on resources was unnecessary particularly as 98 of supporters arrive within two hours of the kick off
5706955 we feel confident we feel pretty confident of where were at right now
5706956 were in good form and were going to have a crack at the big dogs that is what it is and were fine with that
5706957 you just got to bring your shoes in the bag and be ready from the start
5706958 we have to bring energy the states are just going to want to push the ball out and get dunks and get easy baskets
5706959 the governments in victoria south australia and queensland are pretty clean governments but nsw has never got over the rum rebellion
5706960 nsw is very tribal and you have a mates culture in nsw that does not belong in any other state which leads to an acceptance of sanctified corruption
5706961 the perception is that we keep exposing it and nothing happens
5706962 half hearted and cosmetic approaches to preventing public sector corruption
5706963 we have seen a minister of the crown jailed for bribery an inquiry into a second and indeed a third former minister for alleged corruption the former chief stipendiary magistrate jailed for perverting the course of justice a former commissioner of police in the courts on a criminal charge and a disturbing number of dismissals retirements and convictions of senior police officers for offences involving corrupt conduct
5706964 although many australians dream of living on the coast or in the country in reality the best quality of life in australia is found in the suburbs particularly in sydneys north melbournes east and western perth
5706965 the aspiration to move to the coast or the country is part of the australian psyche but what were showing is a lot of that is built on sand
5706966 people are better off in the suburbs in sydneys suburbs residents often have the best of all worlds with access to good schools modern hospitals and reliable jobs but also large houses fast internet connections and low crime rates
5706967 even the public school up here has a swimming pool i think its one of only six in the state
5706968 for two terms a year the kids can go swimming at school
5706969 the main thing is the amount of space weve got
5706970 there arent many places in sydney where you can live close to the city on a 1000 square metre block
5706971 all variations subsequent to mr sanhuezas employment had to be approved by an external project manager and not by
5706972 we are offended and we want to settle the score
5706973 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down
5706974 i think the women who turned up at that protest rally tonight are beauty disadvantaged themselves and they cant get over it so they attack me
5706975 ive got emails from people all over the world telling me that they like someone who talks straight

5706977 i want to send my congratulations to team gb on this golden weekend for british sport eight gold medals and seventeen medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement
5706978 i cant believe weve already beaten the nine golds we won in athens
5706979 dont they get tea at buckingham palace when they get back queen to get more sandwiches in because weve got a lot more medals coming
5706980 eight gold medals and 17 medals in total in one weekend is a superb and unprecedented achievement

5706983 about 10 years ago the energy industry was in a slump and then when williams field built their second plant and enterprise products partners lp came in and all this oil and gas cycling came through our business went way up
5706984 natural gas has really been the biggest money maker in the past couple of years its boosted the whole state but especially the towns that are really close to the energy fields
5706985 the outbreak has already peaked and we are on the downslide
5706986 we try to do a good job of educating people about this
5706987 the only way you can be certain is about yourself you cant be sure your partner is monogamous
5706988 but we have that poll that shows that pawlenty is a drag on the ticket

5706990 the nato membership was clear that russia had violated international laws as well as the rules of the international game
5706991 i am delighted that i am going to be able to go to georgia to report on real nato unity
5706992 unity that russia must abide by the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops and a unity that there must be new practical and political support for georgia as it seeks to defend itself and ensure that its territory is respected that its independence and sovereignty is recognised but also that it starts on the route to nato membership that was set out in may

5707001 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
5707002 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
5707003 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
5707004 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
5707005 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
5707006 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
5707007 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

5707055 i am urging the person responsible for this offence to come forward
5707056 this may have been a spur of the moment action and it is very possible that they did not realise the seriousness of the assault at the time
5707057 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5707058 anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
5707059 this court is allowing two lesbians to force these individuals to choose between being doctors in the state of california or being able to practice their faith
5707060 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president

5707062 die h heren preise resultieren aus den zum teil deutlichen preissteigerungen in ballungsr umen in denen sich die eigentumswohnungen weit berproportional verteuert haben
5707063 we feel really good about our claims and were hopeful that justice will be done we all feel really strongly that they have defrauded us and a major portion of the industry
5707064 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was at about 50 or 60 at best
5707065 when i had another scan on the knee this summer it had not improved so i came back early to try to fix it at the beginning of pre season
5707066 i am not going to set a timetable but i am close
5707067 i am working on my fitness every day and while i have not joined in with the lads yet hopefully it will happen this week
5707068 whether i am fit for portsmouth or the match after that the most important thing is i am healthy for the rest of the season
5707069 i know how much i better i can get being around the players and coaching staff here
5707070 i have not even come close to fulfilling my potential yet and providing i stay healthy this could be a really big season for me
5707071 there are lots of great condos for sale in downtown wilmington and the outlying beach communities right now

5707075 het is zalig om weer samen te werken we kijken er al naar uit we moeten alleen nog een gaatje in onze agenda vinden en dan duiken we meteen de studio in
5707076 ik mis de meiden ik mis die tijd dat we samen op het podium stonden
5707077 ik heb de 2 0 2 software zojuist gedownload maar zie geen verschil
5707078 we vermoeden dus dat het een hardware software specifiek issue van de iphone z lf is
5707079 het gaat hier om een advocaat die een zware berisping heeft gehad van de deken
5707080 het gaat hier om een advocaat die een zware berisping heeft gehad van de deken van advocaten
5707081 het maken van beschrijvingen is volgens google volledig geautomatiseerd het is volgens google niet mogelijk om aanpassingen in de zoekresultaten aan te brengen voor individuele sites
5707082 dit begint echt hilarische vormen aan te nemen nog afgezien van de vraag of mijnheer scheltema dit zo hoog moet opnemen is dit bij uitstek een combinatie van formuleringen die bij google optreedt en niet op miljoenhuizen nl en klup nl
5707083 helaas is de spider van google nog niet in de staat om de relatie van woorden in een tekst te begrijpen voor google is een webpagina gewoon een bak met woorden en als linksboven de naam f j scheltema staat en rechtsonder het woord berisping dan voegt google deze moeiteloos samen alsof er een verband is de suggestie die google deed om de feedback over een andere advocaat alleen op een andere pagina te plaatsen is hetzelfde als tegen een krant zeggen dat ze maar n artikel per pagina mogen publiceren
5707084 dit is al vervelend genoeg voor mijnheer scheltema ik verzoek u dringend om zijn naam niet te noemen in een artikel
5707085 has slammed the door on any real support for the domestic auto industry
5707086 the more one does and sees and feels the more one is able to do and the more genuine may be ones appreciation of fundamental things like home love and understanding companionship
5707087 remember this lesson history does not teach fatalism there are moments when the will of a handful of free men breaks through determinism and opens up new roads people get the history they deserve
5707088 be regular and orderly in your life like a good bourgeois so that you may be violent and original in your work
5707089 there is not in all america a more dangerous trait than the deification of mere smartness unaccompanied by any sense of moral responsibility
5707090 security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing to keep our faces toward change and behave like free spirits in the presence of fate is strength undefeatable
5707091 never interrupt someone doing what you said couldnt be done
5707092 courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace the soul that knows it not knows no release from little things knows not the livid loneliness of fear nor mountain heights where bitter joy can hear the sound of wings how can life grant us boon of living compensate for dull gray ugliness and pregnant hate unless we dare the souls dominion each time we make a choice we pay with courage to behold restless day and count it fair

5707197 well give him his regular routine and run him back out there in five days
5707198 when you have a good knuckleball its tough to catch
5707199 its tough to catch in the bullpen tough to catch in between innings and tough to catch when the umpire says play ball

5707211 i hope to be one of the reading academys success stories
5707212 in our year theres only two of us from the academy who have professional contracts but there are a few other people who will be getting to do the same
5707213 the reading academy definitely does work the whole process is good because it means you bring through home grown talent you dont have to go out and spend money
5707214 i feel valued too we have some good people at reading
5707215 reading is almost a renaissance club and we werent one of the big hitters when it came to a youth programme
5707216 but we have made a lot of progress in a few years and we are looking to pay back the investment from the chairman john madejski
5707217 ideally you would want them in five days a week to progress fully
5707218 but they have school and its just not possible for their parents to bring them here every night its a huge commitment for a family when a kid is in the academy
5707219 there havent really been any boys who have broken through from the academy but were trying to change that
5707220 its massively important for the club and important for english football better english players will be better for the english game
5707221 the number of foreign players in english football has never really bothered me because reading has not really recruited many
5707222 but if i was in the academy at arsenal it might be different
5707223 they have a great set up probably the best in the country but because they set such high standards it is hard to break through theyve got such a good team
5707224 we have got some very good coaches there who believe in the players and give them the right advice and as a young player you can believe in them too
5707225 every training session is in the right manner and it was the same for every game it is a really professional set up
5707226 former reserve team coach frankie bunn has gone to coventry city now but he was the main person who gave me the most personal advice and encouragement when i was coming through
5707227 paul power and alex gibson are both great coaches too and their record proves that because they have brought so many good players through in the last few years
5707228 being a manchester lad and a city fan myself it means the world to me to play for the club
5707229 i have been here since i was 11 and to come through the ranks with people like micah who i am closest to is special
5707230 micahs progress has given me great belief and it is fantastic to have him playing at the club with me and to see him playing for england
5707231 i believe in my own ability anyway but it is great to see your friends do well it wasnt a surprise because i have grown up with them and seen what they are capable of
5707232 it was stevie irelands time to break into the first team then the international set up then it was micahs time and hopefully all of that will happen to me someday too
5707233 it is a massive step up to the premiership from the reserves
5707234 but it is really about getting the confidence to express yourself in the way you do in the reserves and having the belief in your own ability that you can do the things that you can do there when you are in the first team
5707235 it is not easy but if you have got people around you encouraging you and telling you that you can make the step it becomes achievable
5707236 i prefer to play as a striker but at the moment for the first team i play on the left it is difficult in some ways but you adjust to it
5707237 i dont mind i will play anywhere for the club try to get used to it and give 100
5707238 i am nervous before every game but you just have to prepare yourself in the right way every time
5707239 you dont know who is watching and you have got to impress and perform well
5707240 the more first team games you play the more confidence you get
5707241 going on loan is a possibility for me i just want to play for manchester city but if going on loan makes me a better player and gives me more experience then so be it i will do it
5707242 in five years i hope to be an established premiership striker scoring goals every week that would be enough

5707255 there is pleasure in the pathless woods there is rapture in the lonely shore there is society where none intrudes by the deep sea and music in its roar i love not man the less but nature more
5707256 im not sure where i stand and i dont really care
5707257 i know what i have to shoot tomorrow i figure the cuts going to be around 5 over so i figure a round of 70 would do the trick hopefully i can go even lower anywhere in high 60s and get some confidence heading into match play its all about getting into match play its a new tournament from there
5707258 i hit it very well off the tee and didnt hit a lot of fairways i had a rough finish and bogeyed two of last three holes those last three holes turned a decent round into a poor one it didnt make my dinner taste as well i plan on turning it around tomorrow hitting some fairways and playing a good solid round
5707259 so hopefully im able to do well and not worry about making the cut hopefully i can kick back and watch everyone else struggle
5707260 some of my friends told me its a totally different course than no 4 and they said its pretty hard around the greens
5707261 all youve got to do is try to hit it on the center of the green im pretty good at that
5707262 i was hitting it so far offline that i had some good lies in the pine straw and on the packed down cart paths you name it i was on it i got it up and down from everywhere

5707359 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5707360 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane

5707386 my focus today was on the beginning section of the race to make sure that i was up there with the guys and to make sure that i had my speed in the last section of the race i maintained my speed throughout and the other guys did pull away a bit hopefully i will have some more gas in the tank when i need it in the semi finals
5707387 all six guys on paper can make the final so it is going to be a very tough race it is my first do or die race and i am here to do i am going to really gutsy and tough and that all comes from within you have to want it the most
5707388 i havent raced since the polish world cup and that wasnt a good race for me
5707389 i was pretty nervous on the startline and while i didnt feel it was my best i am chuffed to get it out of the way
5707390 i also tend to get better and better with each race so i am pleased to be in the semi finals
5707391 i have reached my goals so now i just want to give it my all in the semi finals
5707392 some day were are on fire and some days were ordinary today we were pretty ordinary and we both know that we can do a lot lot better bear in mind that we only got together in june and this is our seventh race together
5707393 at halfway we realised that we were off the pace a bit and at the 250 meter mark we turner on the
5707394 i have this routine that i use to pick it up at the 250 mark but i was in such a bubble that i didnt do it
5707395 they searched the taxi the child travels in and found a 9mm pistol

5707397 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

5707409 private equity firms are their own worst enemies when they dont recognize that they really need to get this part right
5707410 recruitment of great executives is an integral part of our business model
5707411 we view finding and building these relationships as important as finding investments we are both proactive and reactive in getting to know people
5707412 i think the biggest challenge i faced was really being accepted by the team because you cant be successful in this type of role unless theres a lot of people that support you
5707413 i wish president musharraf all the best we have had difficult days together but also we had good days together all in all we had a good relationship
5707414 the most important thing is not personalities what is important is that we change our expectations and the way we formulate policies to meet those expectations
5707415 if they are doing that in order to get strategic depth it will not happen it has been tried before it failed if they are doing that in order to have a puppet government it will not happen it will not work
5707416 if they are doing that to gain an upper hand against another of their neighbors
5707417 the gains made in adhering to the rule of law may outweigh the painful losses of ancestral homes
5707418 a commitment to the international community and we have a responsibility to keep it
5707419 we are going straight to the place and were going to be happy
5707420 im sorry to disappoint them but that is not possible
5707421 in his attempts to clamp down on pro russian south ossetian separatists mr saakashvili appears to have made one fundamental disastrous miscalculation that the bush administration and the west viewed their relationship with georgia as more important than that with russia

5707427 we look forward to setting up similar operations at all of our transfer stations to give residential haulers a closer drop off location for their recycle routes
5707428 we have plans to work with smurfit in the future to identify fiber rich loads which pass through our other facilities so we can separate that material and recycle it as well

5707431 ich wei dass mit michael ballack und torsten frings noch zwei erfahrene spieler da sind die es zu verdr ngen gilt

5707436 t he second quarter 2008 growth performance once again confirms that a recession in sa is unlikely
5707437 if so there is the potential for interest rates to begin to decline in about mid 2009

5707439 i started selling shirts last may just before school was out they went fast

5707457 the mass media blast comes last the first thing we do is find passionate affinity groups and then we learn what entertainment networks and websites they turn to we then run events we use tv but it comes last
5707458 you can no longer achieve desired reach from one platform
5707459 given media fragmentation the only place i can find all of my customers is at retail shopper marketing will become huge for us in the coming years
5707460 if i ask my marketing class of 50 how many want to go into marketing research maybe one hand would go up

5707472 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5707473 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5707474 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5707475 young bulls struggle to hold on to his heritage will touch childrens sense of justice and lead to some interesting discussions and perhaps further research
5707476 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5707477 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5707478 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5707479 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent
5707480 thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data regarding efficacy and risk of sequelae
5707481 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5707482 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5707483 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5707484 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5707485 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5707486 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5707487 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5707488 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5707489 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5707490 blood and marrow transplantation from unrelated donors has been routinely utilized to treat treatment refractory leukemia and lymphoma for almost two decades
5707491 preliminary results from the few unrelated donor transplants that have been performed for other non malignant conditions show great promise for those who suffer a severely diminished quality of life due to sickle cell disease participants in this large scale study will help us understand how to better treat and possibly even cure sickle cell disease for more people

5707497 the aim of the study was to establish if negative stereotypes about that group do exist and thus if stereotype threat might be one reason that uk ethnic minority medical students are underperforming academically
5707498 the fact that these negative stereotypes exist raises the possibility that stereotype threat may be occurring
5707499 i cant stand liverpool i cant stand liverpool people i cant stand anything to do with them
5707500 you are caught up in the moment and for a few seconds you can go bananas
5707501 what are you meant to do smile sweetly and jog back to the halfway line i laughed when i heard someone say that it was not the behaviour of a 30 year old because they are probably the same people who have accused us of lacking passion in recent games the stick is part of the game one week you take it on the chin the next you give it out that is how local rivals have always been and always should be i have to put up with liverpool fans singing plenty of songs about me none of them tasteful and i struggle to believe that i have caused them any grave offence with an exuberant celebration increasingly people seem to want their footballers to be whiter than white and there are calls for sanctions over every little incident do they want a game of robots
5707502 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
5707503 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
5707504 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
5707505 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5707506 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5707507 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
5707508 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5707509 this is the first step to finding out where the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5707510 we know specifically where a tagged salmon has been and when and that helps us fill in a big gap
5707511 the news is encouraging in 2008 more than 2 000 adult salmon returned to the penobscot river to spawn the highest annual total in more than 20 years research like this ultrasonic tagging project will help us understand why and perhaps then managers can work to actively improve atlantic salmon marine survival
5707512 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5707513 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5707514 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5707515 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5707516 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5707517 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5707518 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5707519 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5707520 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5707521 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5707522 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5707523 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5707524 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5707525 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5707526 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5707527 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5707528 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
5707529 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
5707530 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other
5707531 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5707532 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5707533 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5707534 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5707535 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5707536 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5707537 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
5707538 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5707539 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5707540 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5707541 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5707542 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5707543 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5707544 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5707545 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5707546 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5707547 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones
5707548 the autoimmune epidemic by donna jackson nakazawa is an astounding book

5707552 pues mira siempre he tenido que picar piedra el futbol me ha ense ado a mi edad que hay momentos positivos y hay rachas donde no se dan las cosas pero que no hay que desesperarse el futbol es un deporte en conjunto y cuando el equipo est jugando bien es m s probable que uno se pueda ver mejor en lo individual eso puede explicar un poco este cambio
5707553 obviamente a uno le pone triste cuando las cosas no le van bien es dif cil te da tristeza porque tu familia lo est sufriendo tambi n porque la gente quiere ver algo m s de ti pero algo de lo que me ha ense ado mi familia es de tratar de poner buena cara ante la adversidad y con la confianza de que con dios todo va a mejorar
5707554 por supuesto que me ha pasado muchas veces he querido tirar la toalla
5707555 no para anda yo digo que me exijan eso es mucho mejor porque me ayuda a no darme por vencido a sacar fuerza hambre car cter y para que las cosas salgan bien con ello he ganado mucha experiencia
5707556 por supuesto me siento muy bien jugando d nde me ha colocado el profe manuel lapuente pero ahora hay que mantener la calma poner los pies sobre la tierra porque a n no he ganado nada
5707557 yo pienso igual que el profe lapuente por supuesto que tigres tiene pasta de campe n como me toc vivirlo en pumas pero tenemos que ir paso a paso pero tambi n sabemos que no queda s lo con decirlo
5707558 s es un equipo que tiene mucha garra deseos mucha hambre de triunfo y de salir campe n adem s pumas tambi n ten a tiempo de no ser campe n pero lo m s importante es que est bien dirigido y tiene jugadores con estilo parecido entonces eso me ilusiona m s de que se puede lograr el t tulo
5707559 claro a la selecci n jam s la voy olvidar y claro que quiero estar en el pr ximo mundial
5707560 vamos a ver estos dos d as su evoluci n es probable que pueda hacer f tbol el mi rcoles o jueves pero dependemos de c mo se vaya sintiendo
5707561 ellos tienen su estilo muy definido y creo que ser un partido donde el primero que se equivoque le van a marcar gol
5707562 viene un encuentro contra el superl der contra un equipo muy complicado con un estilo de juego muy parecido al nuestro seguramente va a ser un partido de un gol
5707563 ser a interesante ganar y estar dentro de los primeros lugares
5707564 the first patent describes every remotely user content driven site ever i have a sneaking suspicion here that everyone on this forum could be sued successfully if this holds up
5707565 whats the best way to get from here to there
5707566 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5707567 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5707568 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5707569 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5707570 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5707571 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5707572 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge
5707573 we introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical atlantic
5707574 the index we proposed may provide practical implications for the prediction of atlantic hurricane activities
5707575 further studies are needed to discern the general prediction capability of our results
5707576 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5707577 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5707578 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5707579 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5707580 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5707581 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5707582 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5707583 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5707584 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5707585 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5707586 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5707587 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day
5707588 one night after thinking it over for some time harold decided to go for a walk in the moonlight
5707589 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
5707590 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
5707591 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5707592 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5707593 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5707594 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5707595 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5707596 required reading for all social service workers teachers and relatives of children with autism
5707597 magicians have developed powerful cognitive principles and intuitions about attention and awareness that are not understood scientifically
5707598 weve been able to learn more about cognition from magicians who have developed illusions that trick audiences
5707599 the collaboration on this project has led to many exciting insights to help us understand the brains underlying cognition
5707600 maria shriver is wise funny and caring and it all comes through in her winning guide to life just who will you be were lucky to have her show us the way

5707604 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5707605 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5707606 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5707607 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5707608 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5707609 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5707610 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5707611 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5707612 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5707613 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5707614 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5707615 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5707616 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5707617 in damanjodi we need to keep coal stocks of about 50 000 tonnes but we have at present only 15 000 tonnes
5707618 both the plants continue to suffer due to coal shortage and to meet our requirements we are importing coal from indonesia and some other countries
5707619 it is running more or less at full capacity in case we do not receive coal for two to three days then we will face a crisis
5707620 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5707621 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5707622 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5707623 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5707624 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5707625 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5707626 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5707627 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5707628 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5707629 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5707630 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
5707631 there is so much lost productivity in women with pmdd just think how much more a woman could accomplish if she didnt have to lose so much of herself and her energy every month
5707632 the association of the doctors behaves as if it were an authority that has the right to issue fatwas religious opinions al azhar or the church putting in discussion even the right to citizenship
5707633 why the muslims are not angry at this decision as some copts are
5707634 now that the monsoons turned out right i can see demand going up
5707635 i have 1 800 kilos of steel on tractor and it is a very direct linkage
5707636 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5707637 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5707638 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5707639 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
5707640 judges can punish men who force their daughters to marry like this
5707641 this really nails down the idea of solar influence on continental drought
5707642 the caves havent been disturbed by anything we can see what happened on the scale of a few decades in lakes of the appalachian region youre looking more at the scale of a millennium
5707643 breathe less changing the mix of light and heavy carbon atoms in it
5707644 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
5707645 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between bph luts and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the precise mechanism of action by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
5707646 in afghanistan whether it is forced or not forced it is a crime because the islamic rules say that it is
5707647 i think it is good there are many diseases that can be created in todays world such as hiv through illegal sexual relations
5707648 when i first came to jail i cried so much blood was coming out of my mouth my husbands brother told me he would give my children back when i came out of jail but he has become a talib nobody comes to see us in jail there are a lot of diseases
5707649 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5707650 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions
5707651 they are very aware of the inequality in the system
5707652 the most refreshing thing is that there are plans coming from the department of womens affairs it is not just us pushing our ideas on to them
5707653 please please take our words somewhere where people will be kind and help us
5707654 tahun ini kami memilih nicholas saputra dewi sandra lola amaria olga lydia dan wanda hamidah sebagai brand ambassador vaseline kami tidak asal memilih mereka karena sebelumnya kami melakukan survei terhadap masyarakat pemakai vaseline hasilnya mereka berlimalah yang berhasil memberikan inspirasi kepada masyarakat untuk senantiasa menjaga kulit agar terlihat sehat dan bersih
5707655 kulit nicholas saputra juga putih bersih karena berkat perawatan jadi jangan salah bila wanita saja yang peduli dengan kesehatan kulitnya tetapi pria pun mempunyai perhatian yang sama

5707664 this area has been hit by sectarian violence for many years and this is also a sectarian related incident
5707665 i couldnt see or hear anything for some moments after the blast but then i saw bodies lying on the ground and the wounded were screaming
5707666 the exchange of fire lasted for about nine hours and we have reports that at least 20 militants were killed

5707671 is a great loss for the zambian people who respected and had great affection for him
5707672 its a great loss for the african continent as a whole which appreciated his political courage
5707673 its a big loss for democracy for which he was an ardent defender his whole life
5707674 we do not believe that this will mark the turning of underlying inflation pressures
5707675 evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5707676 also miss jolie says she likes mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5707677 or that matter the thai and vietnamese sons you are photod with weekly too whos pictures you sell to raise money to help the poor their families are victims of america s right wing military incursions too

5707680 make sure to play some of reset generation s story mode tutorial before going online your online opponents will be too busy stealing your princess to coach you
5707681 combos are everything in reset generation i see most new players using their cannons exclusively to protect items dont use your cannons to disrupt your opponents combos
5707682 monster boxes can have a huge effect on the balance of power use them whenever you can and dont let your opponents monsters run free or gang up on you a single blockapede left unchecked can quickly fill the playing field with opponent combos
5707683 if there is an item that you definitely need on your next turn you can protect it by shooting both your cannon balls at it
5707684 dont forget that eggs can be tossed at an opponent even a small amount of damage to an opponent can force them to drop the princess and turn the tide in your favour
5707685 after the game starts do your best to create some combos asap without combos you wont get items and well you will lose quickly
5707686 super stuffer there are times when you might actually want to avoid making combos every time you make a combo it adds to your opponents super meter if it looks like you are about to win dont make combos unless you absolutely need to otherwise you might end up powering your opponent to a surprise victory
5707687 the monster stop youre playing hedgehog and you have a full super meter and a monster box is nearby toss the monster out in front of you so that when you hog ride the monster acts as a break this is a good way to hog ride into your castle while holding a princess
5707688 most surprising move ever using the sci fi knight sci fi mind trick an opponent into rescuing your princess guaranteed to drop jaws but not very good for your ranking
5707689 hes just a young player that hasnt done it but wants to
5707690 part of special teams is want to he definitely has that

5707699 when our employees become proficient in english and assimilate into our society it benefits the company the community and the individual
5707700 if i had known i would be talking like this i wouldnt believe it
5707701 if i know english and i get laid off i can find other work i am prepared for anything
5707702 the goal is to supply people with everything they might need to know to make the smartest decisions
5707703 easier access to timely and useful water weather and climate information will save lives property and resources
5707704 the southeast marine weather portal has been developed with the end user the mariner sailor surfer beachgoer in mind
5707705 the portal provides the information they need to make safe and informed decisions before going out on the water or to the beach

5707738 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5707739 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place

5707741 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies

5708304 meares medal was the only one taken by the australian team that dominated the track four years ago with five bronze medals that place has now been taken by britain which took seven golds in beijing
5708305 there was probably a little pressure on us coming in here you cant be too disappointed with a few fourths at the olympic games
5708306 as a 20 year old going into my first olympic games and coming away with a gold medal and a world and olympic record that was definitely one of the highlights of my career it was when i started to believe in myself

5708315 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5708316 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5708317 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5708318 simpler financial instruments and less leverage make up a painfully obvious prescription for fixing the design of our markets these modifications will lead to a financial marketplace that will be apparently less finely tuned and less responsive to investor needs but like the coarse response mechanism of the cockroach when faced with the inevitable march of the events that we cant even contemplate simpler financial instruments and less leverage will create a market that is more robust and survivable

5708324 ich glaube nicht dass isolation die richtige antwort auf russlands fehlverhalten ist
5708325 dass russland nicht die falschen lehren aus den geschehen der vergangenen tage zieht wir k nnen nicht so tun als sei nichts geschehen
5708326 wir m ssen ein gemeinsames signal geben und es sollte wirksam sein
5708327 ich bin nicht daf r den nato russland rat auszusetzen
5708328 aber wir k nnen angesichts des unverh ltnism igen einsatzes von gewalt auch nicht so tun als sei nichts passiert ich bin berzeugt dass wir auch in zukunft die m glichkeit zu einem dialog zwischen der nato und russland haben sollten
5708329 ich bin sehr betr bt dass russland und amerika nicht f hig sind miteinander ber ein sehr sehr wichtiges problem zu reden
5708330 wenn wir einen nato russland rat haben und der kommt nicht zusammen nach dem was jetzt geschehen ist dann frage ich mich welchen sinn er berhaupt hat
5708331 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5708332 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5708333 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5708334 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5708335 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5708336 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5708337 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5708338 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5708339 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5708340 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5708341 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5708342 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5708343 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5708344 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5708345 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5708346 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5708347 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5708348 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5708349 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5708350 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5708351 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5708352 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5708353 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5708354 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5708355 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5708356 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5708357 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5708358 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5708359 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5708360 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5708361 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

5708378 if july turns out to be the low point for this bear market it will then mark the second highest level of valuation that a cyclical bull has ever started from the highest starting valuation level was in 2003 the risks are material if this bear market was to end at the average price to peak earnings multiple of past recessionary troughs for the price multiple on peak earnings to touch the long term average of 10 4 the s amp p would need to fall to s amp p 885

5708395 the strategic objective is to develop this countrys security forces both army and police so that they can conduct counter insurgency operations maintain the rule of law and eventually provide secure and stable conditions for the people and the government so the goal is afghans first afghans lead and it will be etts and pmts down range who will help them become self sufficient at the province and district levels where they are most needed

5708397 i am proud that we are a guard team from all over the country and we are doing fine
5708398 great energetic troops but we are often ready before they are
5708399 the ingenuity we used to set our vehicles up the speed we mount up for quick reaction force and just the way we do business this is a really good team
5708400 they really like it when we let them try our weapons
5708401 during every convoy we just pour our thoughts over the headsets of what may await us this is really what it is like
5708402 there is an unmistakable screech a rocket makes when it comes in
5708403 you feel helpless because you dont know where it will land you just know its going to be close
5708404 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5708405 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5708406 you know chuck i might have to get out of the navy
5708407 i was still in the dive i had just started to pull out and got hit by a surface to air missile and it basically took the wing off the aircraft
5708408 and so i was gyrating very violently almost straight down so i had to eject very quickly
5708409 then we all pushed him here to the edge of the lake and the security forces surrounded him at that point everyone in the village was here everyone came down to see the american pilot
5708410 would you like him to be president of the united states
5708411 that depends on the u s people i dont know
5708412 he would never admit the united states made a mistake in the war therefore i say john mccain is an extremely conservative man he was loyal to his ideology
5708413 i wasnt as tough as i had hoped to be and i certainly wasnt as strong as some of my comrades
5708414 there was a correlation between my refusal to accept early release and my treatment
5708415 because after it was clear to the vietnamese i would not do that then the treatment got very much worse
5708416 i think in many ways it was harder on him than it was on me
5708417 this is not true because our nation is civilized and humanitarian and you do not understand the vietnamese nation

5708430 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
5708431 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5708432 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5708433 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
5708434 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
5708435 i think if parents are going to drive their kids to school and not use bus service thats already available that creates problems
5708436 those choices have to be revisited just like everywhere else
5708437 the stalker derogates the victim reducing him her to an object this allows the stalker the ability to feel angry with the victim without experiencing empathy
5708438 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5708439 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5708440 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5708441 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5708442 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5708443 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5708444 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5708445 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5708446 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5708447 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5708448 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5708449 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5708450 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5708451 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5708452 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5708453 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5708454 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5708455 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5708458 das ist wichtig f r mich ich muss mir erst noch ein bild machen
5708459 wir haben zwei sehr gute goalies leider ist j rgen macho noch verletzt deshalb ist es f r mich schwer zu sagen wer die nummer eins ist
5708460 ich wei mit welchem system wir spielen doch mein motto ist informationen zu suchen und zu finden nicht sie herauszugeben das ist eine interne angelegenheit
5708461 eine genaue einsch tzung ist selbstverst ndlich noch nicht m glich da ich einige spieler vorher nicht gekannt habe aber ich habe ein gutes gef hl f r mich ist es eine normale situation ich mache diesen beruf schon seit 35 jahren aber sicher ist es am anfang schon ein bisschen schwieriger
5708462 die italiener sind genauso stark wie die franzosen in dem spiel wird man sehen wer sich gegen solche gegenspieler durchsetzt und wer nicht
5708463 ich m chte meinen eigenen stil durchsetzen aber es gibt dinge die ich beibehalten werde an unserer art zu spielen wird sich nichts ndern
5708464 ich achte nicht auf das alter sondern auf die leistung
5708465 uns stehen zwei qualifikationsspiele bevor n chstes jahr findet der konf derationen pokal statt da bleibt wenig zeit f r experimente wir m ssen sofort mit der richtigen einstellung beginnen aber grunds tzlich steht die t r f r alle noch offen ich habe 15 jahre lang bei real madrid gearbeitet und auch dort kritik hinnehmen m ssen weil ich versucht habe junge talente einzusetzen nat rlich ist das nicht die gleiche arbeit wie die mit einer nationalmannschaft man arbeitet hier nicht t glich zusammen aber das ergebnis ist hnlich es gibt viele gemeinsamkeiten mit dem vereinsfu ball man versucht immer die bestm gliche leistung zu erreichen
5708466 es ist wundervoll auf die euro zur ckzublicken und das erreichte zu genie en aber die spieler d rfen nicht in der vergangenheit schwelgen und sie d rfen sich nicht nur auf diesen erfolg reduzieren es muss unser ziel sein das bestm gliche zu erreichen das habe ich mehrfach gesagt das bedeutet dass wir nicht arrogant sein d rfen wir m ssen auf dem boden bleiben es bedeutet ganz einfach dass wir ein team haben das erfolge einfahren kann
5708467 qu rabia me da haber tenido que quedarme en casa

5708475 a few years ago i had the opportunity to fly along americas borders with my good friend john hensley who was the assistant commissioner of u
5708476 as we were flying over the desert we landed in the middle of nowhere
5708477 theres no doubt that americans possess the resources and passion to close off our borders and ports from illegal immigration and contraband
5708478 i dont lay the blame on our dedicated border agents
5708479 lets ask ourselves why is congress not securing our borders
5708480 at least as many as those who ask to see our normal kosher credentials
5708481 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records
5708482 democracy is beautiful in theory in practice it is a fallacy you in america will see that some day
5708483 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5708484 slaughter without the infliction of unnecessary suffering by the jewish method for the food of jews by a jew who holds a licence
5708485 the discomfort caused to enable munachas was not considered unnecessary
5708486 the fact that these practices were instituted at all is a bit hard to defend according to your position
5708487 hatayvah hagayvah ve hamammon motzeein es ha adam min ha olam
5708488 a practice which caused discomfort to the animal was not considered unnecessary since it enabled shchita
5708489 rachel agriprocessors and the ou are in the mchechsher ka hru side of the business there is no need for attention to the suffering of animals because they are not observing kashrus or as most know it kosher
5708490 yeah this is nothing new its been going on since forever
5708491 at us non kosher facilities the standard method employs a stun bolt gun that drives a bolt under tremendous pressure into the brain of the animal resulting in instant death
5708492 1 yes a proper shechita should be done in one motion without sawing back and forth
5708493 if the shochet is shechting many animals at a time without a break or pause then one bracha is sufficient
5708494 might be construed as a brand of evil on a practice which congress condemned but was willing to tolerate
5708495 when the germans occupied poland during the last war the first thing which they proclaimed was to prohibit shehitah i would like to quote their regulation in any territory under german rule cruelty to animals of any kind is not permissible effective immediately therefore shehitah the painful slaughtering of animals by means of the gradual draining of blood for the purposes of so called kosher meat consumption is prohibited this is to go into effect immediately any person guilty of shehitah is punishable by an imprisonment for not less than 1 year the prison sentence may be served in concentration camps
5708496 though the proposed legislation is not motivated by anti semitic sentiments the effect of its passage will undoubtedly be a campaign waged by the confused and overzealous against jewish ritual slaughter recent developments in england prove this point
5708497 no person shall be liable for any contravention of these provisions in respect of the slaughter of any animal slaughtered without the infliction of unnecessary suffering by the jewish method for the food of jews and by the mohammedan method for the food of mohammedans
5708498 application of a neutral generally applicable law to religiously motivated action
5708499 when a very large transverse incision is made across the neck a number of vital tissues are transected including skin muscle trachea oesophagus carotid arteries jugular veins major nerve trunks e g vagus and phrenic nerves plus numerous minor nerves such a drastic cut will inevitably trigger a barrage of sensory information to the brain in a sensible conscious animal we are persuaded that such a massive injury would result in very significant pain and distress in the period before insensibility supervenes

5708505 richard wright made some terrific saves particularly in the first half and there was one cleared off the line
5708506 we could have been 2 0 up in that game but we have picked the bones of how we can defend better
5708507 we have worked hard on the training ground and worked on various things that we can tighten up weve got to believe in everything that we are doing

5708536 its indeed a tragedy because he was a good captain but i am sure another captain will be found to steer the ship
5708537 the good thing is that he taught all of us how to govern this country with integrity
5708538 we will surely find someone wearing the same team shirt and macroeconomic policy will continue the same way

5708540 the president can go anywhere and is not afraid of anything
5708541 our president will never be arrested as long we are alive as long as we are living nothing will happen to our president
5708542 he has a lot of talent he trained very hard had a great attitude
5708543 this will make him stronger and will give him more international experience we want him back for the next olympics im very proud of him
5708544 i couldnt get a punch in and when i did it didnt register
5708545 for mccain not only does it patriotism arise from his very being his identity but it plays a dual role of emphasizing a national security part of the campaign and the contrast between him and obama
5708546 hes going to demonstrate love of country by word and deed at the convention
5708547 its not something that you repeat i am patriot there are no specific patriotic activities its got to come across at an authentic and sincere way
5708548 there is a historic suspicion that african americans are less patriotic
5708549 conservative whites look at them blacks as unpatriotic and yet if you look at the constitution and the history the black community has been trying to make that constitution work for everybody
5708550 he has been in combat and i have been in combat but just because he is a military man running for office doesnt mean he has the right to run the country
5708551 i try to go into a race with a frame of mind that i couldnt have trained harder

5708554 so i get a mental strength through training as hard as i can every possible time i believe that hard work is what gets you to the top

5708928 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5708929 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking

5708940 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5708941 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5708942 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5708943 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5708944 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5708945 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5708946 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5708947 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5708948 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5708949 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5708950 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5708951 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5708952 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5708953 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5708954 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5708955 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5708956 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5708957 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5708958 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5708959 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5708960 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5708961 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5708962 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5708963 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5708964 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5708965 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5708966 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5708967 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5708968 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5708969 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5708970 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5708971 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5708972 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5708973 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5708974 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5708975 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5708976 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5708977 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5708978 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5708979 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5708980 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5708981 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5708982 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5708983 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5708984 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5708985 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5708986 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5708987 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5708988 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5708989 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5708990 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5708991 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5708992 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5708993 this is a planning took where all things are going
5708994 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5708995 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5708996 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5708997 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5708998 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5708999 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5709000 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

5709004 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5709005 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5709006 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5709007 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5709008 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5709009 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5709010 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5709011 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5709012 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5709013 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5709014 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5709015 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5709016 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5709017 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5709018 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5709019 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5709020 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5709021 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5709022 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5709023 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5709024 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5709025 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5709026 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5709027 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5709028 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5709029 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5709030 any organization that has a goal of being to focus on its staff above all else plans goals and strategies are great but whos going to implement those great strategies if staff are not capable the best laid plans will find themselves by the wayside here are some thoughts about hiring and training future proof staff hire creative people you know the kind theyre the ones who always look at a problem with a unique perspective and bring new and better ideas to the table they can usually solve a problem multiple ways on any budget and with flair instead of hiring for specific immediate needs hire creative people who can adapt and improve for many needs now and in the future hire passionate individuals dont hire people who want a job thats all theyll ever do instead hire people who eat breathe and sleep libraries information and community and want to do those things at your library these are the people who will relish finding new innovative ways to connect their community to the library these creative passionate librarians will need a new type of skill set to be future proof these skills have nothing to do with performing a successful reference interview or memorizing aacr2 instead they need to be adept at change change will happen in a future proof library probably rapidly at times future proof librarians must be not just comfortable with change but able to lead it they must be computer social networking experts blogs have been around for over 11 years social networks for even longer computers have been in our libraries for more than 20 years why are we still hiring people who cant use these tools why have we kept people on staff who cant use them our library world is quickly changing and computers and online communities are a major component of future proofing a library if we were a taxi company we wouldnt hire someone who couldnt or wouldnt learn to drive a new transmission would we they need to scan the horizon they should be able to look out at their little part of the library world see whats developing and be able to figure out how to implement it finally and probably most important the future proof library and the future proof librarian need one simple thing to succeed they need their library administration to lead the way that means that all the stuff i just said above needs to be there already
5709031 the best way to future proof libraries is not by electronically reimagining our most valuable attributes in a collective attempt to cheat obsolescence our insurance is going to come from a much more basic place we have to turn inward understand why libraries have been such fabulously lasting cultural institutions and reflect on how best to transfer this to the modern information climate libraries represent thoughtfulness peace and possibility and we should strive to keep them as transparent and accessible as possible the profit imperative increasingly shapes the way that information is organized and accessed but libraries can thrivesimply because we exist in opposition to this model a truly national and effective libraries are viable and valuable advertising campaign that takes on grassroots and major media tactics would be incredibly worthwhile its easy to recognize the tone this message might take when you consider the movements that are creating change on a broad scale the social capital of libraries speaks to the same populist sustainable spirit that drives the open source open access slow food local diy and green movements the only difference being that weve been at it for millennia libraries are the quintessence of the sustainable information movement and we create community spaces that simultaneously validate the universal human need for the social the intellectual and the thrifty we also have an unbelievable wealth of dedicated staff for whom libraries are symbolic of the greatest good drawn together in a vocational community of practitioners that could hardly be more enthusiastic or protective of the services we provide its critical that we teach our users that they can believe in libraries like they can believe in any other good cause because library sustainability is essentially in their hands it is our responsibility to make sure that they have enough reasons to understand appreciate and advocate for us
5709032 future proofed libraries will be flatter more transparent institutions free of hierarchal organization
5709033 i think that she lives vicariously through him because shes a very smart woman who is very successful as a doctor and has a great job and a wonderful position but also has had less and less to do with the actual practicing of medicine as the years have gone by so i think shes excited by what he does and how he does it and shes deeply frustrated by him at the same time
5709034 my biggest concern is we have to have these practices
5709035 we have one tuesday which will be a hawaii scrimmage
5709036 we have some experience here i dont but some people have experience we have a walk through set up and we have one practice banked which means were one ahead so at some point i can cancel one last thursday i was going to give the players a day off but with the rain we just went we have a good plan in place if the storm doesnt just hang here
5709037 i was very disappointed in black at this point last year but he had a great spring
5709038 the injury set us back quite a bit but ahmad graded out a champion in our first scrimmage and hes a natural football player you wish he was a little bigger taller and faster but he can get himself in the right position
5709039 i like that theyve been cooped up in the hotel and i dont hear it so either they whine real quietly or theyre starting to enjoy being around each other
5709040 i havent been on a college team when ive had this many choices at running back going into fall camp with four what i would say quality players at that position that is our deepest position we can go four deep and feel very confident with whoever lines up
5709041 im prone to have one featured back if somebody can step forward and make a lot of great plays running and receiving because we do like for our tailbacks to catch the ball
5709042 they have to be able to do four things make good runs hang onto the ball catch the ball and stay healthy
5709043 this is something all of our backs are going to have to work on
5709044 we sometimes like to check to a pass to the tailback in certain situations if we cant catch it we wont be checking to it as much that will hurt us offensively if we cant have that as part of the package we also cant be worried about which tailback is in the game as to whether or not we can make that check
5709045 well its not particularly when youre turning in all kinds of different directions hand eye coordination whether you have stiff hands or soft hands if you catch the ball on your fingertips or in the palm of your hand
5709046 everybody has different skills and talents but this is something we will work on and work on this fall
5709047 i know our defensive backs never want to see him break though the line of scrimmage because they hate tackling him or trying to tackle him i should say
5709048 it will vary game to game but were looking at 20 to 30 snaps possibly in two backs and then you go to the one back
5709049 were a multiple set offense and you need a good fullback we have a good fullback in john conner
5709050 we ended up opposing that amendment in retrospect i wish we hadnt
5709051 i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5709052 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5709053 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5709054 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5709055 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5709056 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5709057 brod was an extremely versatile fertile even obsessive writer who kept a diary
5709058 what we believe hoffe must have is the diary he kept from the day he arrived in tel aviv in 1939 filled with observations for researchers it would be very significant
5709059 todos tenemos la misma sangre egipcia y si el motivo de la medida es prohibir el tr fico de rganos lo rechazamos porque puede ocurrir tambi n entre fieles de la misma religi n
5709060 tenemos miedo a que en el futuro haya hospitales para cristianos y otros para musulmanes
5709061 todo es para proteger a los musulmanes pobres de los cristianos ricos que les compran sus rganos y al rev s
5709062 impedir cualquier intento de enga ar a los enfermos y robarles sus rganos sobre todo si ocurre entre cristianos y musulmanes porque en este caso s abre la puerta a una crisis entre ambas comunidades
5709063 instigar a la discriminaci n entre un musulm n y un cristiano que viven en el mismo pa s
5709064 discriminatoria ya que viola los derechos humanos la constituci n y la unidad nacional
5709065 si el sindicato no anula la medida habr m s conflictos entre cristianos y musulmanes

5709079 stirring up trouble is what shes all about think ann coulter without the bestsellers and the cable talking head slot on fox but with a splashy news outfit behind her to add legitimacy but maureen dowd isnt an unrepentant right winger she simply whispers her poison pen politics fed in part this season no doubt by the unhinged fringe to appreciate maureen dowd when she gets into her dirt dishing rants you have to understand that her blasts come from sources she simply channels into clever bursts that are meant to sound definitive
5709080 no 1 we need a way for people to keep making a living here
5709081 people are interested in our island way of life and theyre willing to pay for having these experiences
5709082 what weve seen is that baby boom age tourists want something experiential
5709083 they want something authentic they want to meet folks eat what they eat hear how they talk learn how they live
5709084 there was no way we were going to miss out again
5709085 this place is culture shock like going back in time and who could turn down the cakes
5709086 ive wondered for years whether mine would be the last generation really living and growing up here
5709087 the good news is we the island have four children living here now and one on the way
5709088 i have been getting some kayakers wholl come over and go camping overnight

5709091 any change in the units ownership structure would be bittersweet for lehman

5709097 home depot is pulling out of a lot of places but theyre not pulling out of here
5709098 i think it would require somebody to have a crystal ball
5709099 certainly there are some concerns with the housing market the price of oil and now the banking issues as those things begin to turn around certainly i think the economy will suit
5709100 certainly lenders are cautious in providing financing for new retail developments
5709101 lenders state that the feds have new regulations which in turn diminishes the amount of capital available for borrowing
5709102 having said all this this is not the first recession or economic downturn that these major companies have gone through we remain optimistic that they will continue exploring future opportunities in this growing marketplace as the economy strengthens
5709103 we are continuing to receive strong interest from national and regional retailers looking to join hammock landing
5709104 detroit is falling its all foreign at the top and all american at the bottom
5709105 the amount of small children in the house the bars on the windows the lack of escape routes all of those things mixed with someone setting fires is just a formula for a disaster

5709166 kita harus meneruskan cita cita kemerdekaan ini dan menghayati tentang maksud kemerdekaan
5709167 kita memiliki harga diri semangat untuk berjuang dan memiliki dedikasi yang tinggi itu sebetulnya modal utama untuk kita dapat tetap bangkit jika kita tetap bekerja keras dan bersatu
5709168 suatu negara hanya akan dapat eksis jika bangsanya memahami makna dari kemerdekaan itu sendiri
5709169 kalau kita sendiri tidak menghargai pahlawan pahlawan kita kita akan tidak punya identitas diri tidak punya jati diri lalu kita mau kemana menurut saya itu maknanya jauh lebih dalam ketimbang tahun 2009 nanti

5709344 however at the moment all we have are media reports so i would say that all this remains speculative the board next meets in march so to suggest what action might be taken would be premature
5709345 a decision will have to be made about this at some point but we are not at that point at the moment
5709346 these are the normal and regular conversations which take place between the boards in international cricket
5709347 the summer of 2009 is exciting for the ecb but it also has some logistical issues which need to be resolved
5709348 we are a member of the icc are hosting the tournament and its been on the schedule for many many months
5709349 it would be safe to assume that the fact that we bid for the tournament which is an icc event means we will abide by any protocols set by the icc
5709350 two guys on the roof every guy gets a share five shares is plenty

5709355 the purpose of studying economics is not to acquire a set of ready made answers to economic questions but to learn how to avoid being deceived by economists
5709356 the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume and that the abstract income based way in which we measure the so called poverty rate no longer applies to our society
5709357 the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume
5709358 that is two weeks in a row the defense has come out and whipped the offenses butt i dont think ive ever been involved in a scrimmage here where the offense hasnt scored at least one touchdown ive been here 11 years and this is the first time that has happened the defense played great and the offense has a long ways to go

5709380 the music was way more grounded than it is today today you dont feel the movement back then you felt the movement
5709381 like when wu tang clan came in it was like regardless of where we went people knew who we were
5709382 or if we were in a new city there was one person who knew who we was and that would spread to ten more people and so on and so forth up until it was oh you aint up on that wu tang stuff oh you aint down homie
5709383 same thing with cash money no limit death row it goes on and on all these movements you dont have that any more
5709384 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5709385 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5709386 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5709387 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5709388 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5709389 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5709390 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5709391 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5709392 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5709393 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

5709397 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5709398 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5709399 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5709408 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5709409 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5709410 russian citizens are proud that russia came to the defense of the weaker one that it came to the defense of its compatriots that it stopped bloodshed
5709411 georgian president mikhail saakashvili went too far when georgia attacked at night and when peaceful civilians died
5709412 they perceive it as the lesser of the two evils
5709413 georgia with all its sins and it has big ones did not attack russia wrote moscow blogger alexander samarzev
5709414 and calls to completely destroy it which have been voiced here are fascist calls

5709416 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5709417 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5709418 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5709419 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5709420 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5709421 college students can get lost in the paradigm of popular culture that portrays alcohol use as glamorous and cutting edge
5709422 students particularly first year students who are still adjusting to being on their own are trying to manage several areas in their lives while in college they need to succeed in their classes and plan for their futures all while trying to build and maintain a social life its important they recognize that while they live in a culture that can present drinking as glamorous and sophisticated the choice to drink can keep students from getting to where they want to be in their college and professional careers
5709423 this campaign encourages students to ask themselves the important question what do i need to do to get to where i want to get in life we want to make students aware that they need to be on their game so to speak so they can actively manage their individual risk levels for drinking and drug use
5709424 as part of aodrcs outreach funding from a substance abuse prevention education grant fund was used to create informational mouse pads which will be distributed in computer labs across campus
5709425 we also want to produce a parents guide that presents suggested points of discussion for parents when talking to their young adult college students about alcohol and drug use and were working on getting the funds to produce a students guide to alcohol this guide highlights important points about socializing and outlines the possible consequences for students if they do choose to drink and it details westerns drug and alcohol policies
5709426 garry johnson the vice president of student services and his staff helped us incorporate the safe choices safe campus campaign into westerns existing plans for the 2008 2009 academic year theme health and wellness challenges and responsibilities
5709427 there are many campus based options for socializing at western
5709428 intramurals activities and events organized by the office of student activities athletics as well as the newly renovated spencer recreation center provide students with viable options for building and maintaining social connections
5709429 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5709430 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5709431 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5709432 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5709433 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5709434 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5709435 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5709436 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5709437 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5709438 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5709439 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5709440 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5709441 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5709442 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5709443 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5709444 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5709445 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5709446 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5709447 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5709448 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5709449 who are open to doing something on the production side
5709450 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5709451 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5709452 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5709453 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5709454 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5709455 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5709456 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5709457 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5709458 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5709459 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5709460 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5709461 well also share plans and provide an update on the status of the new multicultural center which will be our new home once it s completed next spring
5709462 anyone who would like to register to vote in this fall s local and national elections will need to bring two forms of id including one showing a current address
5709463 we do outreach programs and have speakers on various women s health concerns so we re excited about having the opportunity to tie these in with the broader campus theme this year
5709464 our open house will provide an opportunity for the public to peruse our many resources dealing with women s health including books pamphlets magazines newsletters and journals
5709465 two newly acquired books that we ll have on display and available for checkout are the doctors complete college girls health guide from sex to drugs to the freshman 15 by jennifer wider m d and what to ask the doc the questions to ask to get the answers you need co authored by wiu alumna margaret fitzpatrick
5709466 cada banco ha sido tratado de manera distinta por lo que el plazo de venta que vence este 19 de agosto ha servido para darle una soluci n al tratamiento de estas inversiones que de haberse aplicado de manera estricta hubiese causado serios problemas a un grupo importante de bancos y por ende al sistema financiero nacional
5709467 en t rminos generales y a partir de la informaci n obtenida por los balances auditados parece que el tema de las posibles p rdidas se ha sobredimensionado consideramos que si es tratado con rapidez y se solicita a los bancos que sufrieron p rdidas que capitalicen las mismas este problema podr a solventarse de manera adecuada
5709468 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5709469 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5709470 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5709471 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5709472 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5709473 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5709474 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5709475 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5709476 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5709477 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5709478 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5709479 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5709480 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5709481 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5709482 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5709483 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5709484 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5709485 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5709486 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5709487 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5709488 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5709489 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5709490 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5709491 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5709492 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5709493 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5709494 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5709495 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5709496 hay una estructura de intermediarios que puede variar con cada caso y en el camino se puede quedar buena parte de los fondos no necesariamente se trata de hechos de corrupci n ya que las malas pr cticas pueden derivarse de la carencia de herramientas metodol gicas para administrar un presupuesto

5709518 aside from retrenching from the one month blip in the permits data the much slower pace of building permits also reflects the contraction in lending
5709519 credit conditions have tightened sharply and that is affecting appetite for housing in addition the confluence of other macroeconomic headwinds such as falling house prices and elevated foreclosures has also limited demand for housing buskas noted that on a year ago basis housing starts are now down 29 6 while building permits are down 32 4
5709520 there are still few signs that activity in the housing market has reached a nadir
5709521 but at least in the case of housing starts it seems that the pace of decline has slowed when compared to last year

5709667 que mi grupo parlamentario sabe es que al portavoz del grupo parlamentario socialista no le importa que se celebre antes del congreso del partido socialista
5709668 supongo que habr consultado con los cuatro o cinco candiatos que en estos momentos tiene el partido socialista
5709669 hicimos una propuesta muy coherente de celebrar el debate de pol tica general
5709670 porque cre amos que deb an estar centrados en algo que a toda la sociedad valenciana le importa

5709673 sabiendo que ya no hay ning n impedimento de que se celebre antes
5709674 ser antes del congreso socialista porque al grupo socialista no le importa tenerlo antes del congreso o despu s del congreso porque sa es nuestra propuesta
5709675 trabajando en red de manera sosegada tranquila y sin prisas se ha establecido el clima de reflexi n que propon amos desde un principio para que el proceso culmine y no empiece en la elecci n de un equipo de direcci n y un secretario general del pspv

5709679 desde el municipalismo castellonense valenciano y alicantino se puede crear una pol tica sin prisas ni obsesiones por el poder que convierta al pspv en un referente claro en el 2011 que fortalezca la idea de la comunidad valenciana como un lugar de oportunidades para emprendedores y un ejemplo para toda europa de un verdadero sistema del estado del bienestar eficaz

5709683 debe potenciar esta imagen de honorabilidad frente a la gesti n de gobierno valenciano vengativo con los suyos que hace modificaciones presupuestarias cada 14 de agosto donde el presidente del consell no comparece nunca en les corts valencianes y donde la imputaci n en algunos casos sirve de avales dentro de su partido

5709686 cuando alguien no tiene claro qu hacer lo nico que crea son extravagancias en lugar de propuestas serias
5709687 una extravagancia peligrosa para el futuro de la comunitat valenciana es la educaci n en ingl s

5709730 hey ill share my pew with an extraterrestrial any day
5709731 it might be the case that aliens had discarded theology and religious practice long ago as primitive superstition and would rapidly convince us to do the same
5709732 alternatively if they retained a spiritual aspect to their existence we would have to concede that it was likely to have developed to a degree far ahead of our own if they practiced anything remotely like a religion we should surely soon wish to abandon our own and be converted to theirs
5709733 upon confirmation of contact between earth and an extraterrestrial civilization of intelligent beings the long established religious traditions of earth would confront a crisis of belief and perhaps even collapse
5709734 would so undercut my beliefs that my beliefs would face a crisis
5709735 i believe that christ became incarnate human in order to redeem humanity and atone for the original sin of adam and eve could there be a world of extraterrestrials maybe it doesnt change what christ did
5709736 within the scope of christian theology it appears that little if any beliefs preclude the existence of extraterrestrial beings
5709737 their presence would at most widen the scope of ones understanding of creation and create some puzzles for how christians understand the work of salvation
5709738 it appears that people who embrace a traditional religious belief system do not fear for their own personal belief nor are they particularly worried about their own respective religious tradition a shred of evidence suggests that believers in one religious tradition might be more inclined to impute fragility to other religions to which they do not subscribe or about which they know little
5709739 non religious people seem to know too little about religious people because they are mistaken in their assessment of the fragility of religious beliefs
5709740 the major religious traditions of our world will confront a crisis let alone a collapse

5709750 chinas economy is indeed slowing but the timing is largely coincidental
5709751 buoyant domestic demand and an infrastructure boom suggest that the slowdown will be less severe than olympics pessimists predict
5709752 i think the decline of the record industry in many ways is quite good for the health of music
5709753 because i think it gives people other routes and other avenues to get their music across such as festivals and live music and i think that there is something exciting about seeing bands live
5709754 im quite happy that people party when they hear my music
5709755 thats absolutely fine im not particularly precious about that i like to see people have a good time
5709756 we try and do that a lot because we try and put new songs into the show all the time and sometimes we never know quite whats going to happen in the show
5709757 you never know how long the improvised passages will go on and what will happen there
5709758 but i wouldnt say though that i tailor the show specifically to festivals we do the same whether we play in arenas opening for tom petty or whether we play our own shows or whether its a festival we play a little bit longer at festivals so that obviously opens the door for us to do slightly more extended improvised passages
5709759 i always imagined that northern california has much more organic bohemian view toward music
5709760 i mean we have to think in the first place it was the birth of jam bands known as the jam band genre with the grateful dead but it also has various other influences such as santana of course

5709778 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5709779 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5709780 he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5709781 i will let no one question my love of this country
5709782 i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5709783 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5709784 the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large russia has invaded the sovereign nation of georgia iran is pursuing nuclear weapons the next commander in chief is going to have to exercise the best possible judgment in getting us through these difficult times
5709785 six years ago i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan
5709786 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks and that as despicable as saddam hussein was posed no imminent threat to the american people
5709787 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
5709788 for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
5709789 our military is badly overstretched a fact that has surely been noted in capitals around the world
5709790 and while we pay a heavy price in iraq and americans pay record prices at the pump iraqs government is sitting on a 79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits
5709791 this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5709792 sen mccain argued that we could just and i quote muddle through in afghanistan and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month
5709793 russian troops have yet to begin the withdrawal required by the cease fire signed by their president and we are hearing reports of russian atrocities burning wheat fields brutal killings and the destruction of georgias infrastructure and military assets

5709851 id say both in the beginning i was stressed out but i was having fun i was goin through challenges ya know when you do methamphetamine it messes with your emotions and mind and stuff partying for that many years its like a kid goin to the candy store every day sooner or later hes gonna end up sick and unhealthy ya know after time passes you start to become more normal again but i had a lot of fits or rage i would break things in the studio if things didnt go my way so that had to go but the times when things were goin really good were fun while i was going through those challenges i could take time off i would take like even six months off ya know in 2006 i hadnt done music for a while and just wanted to take a break it was cool to do that because there was no pressure there was no one tellin me dude you gotta get into the studio and finish this weve got a deadline there was no deadline it was just whatever happened ya know everything happened the way it was supposed to because im a new man now im totally calm when things dont do my way i dont freak out im just a new person and it feels great
5709852 its really good i just talked to them last summer its all good ya know when you hang out and drink beer and do drugs with someone for ten years and then you get sober and then go hang out with them again youre going to feel uncomfortable i still feel a little uncomfortable im sure therell be a day when i can hang out with them again it has nothing to do with them its just the circumstances ya know i dont know what the future holds maybe if one day wanted to do an album that had something to do with what im into now you never know what the future holds but ive got no plans to hook up with them musically as of now but i never know what the futures gonna bring
5709853 i definitely consider it metal and heavy let people label it however they want ya know it totally sounds like

5709859 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming

5709862 college presidents from about 100 of the nations best known universities including duke dartmouth and ohio state are calling on lawmakers to consider lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18 saying current laws actually encourage dangerous binge drinking on campus
5709863 is made up of chancellors and presidents of universities and colleges across the united states these higher education leaders have signed their names to a public statement that the 21 year old drinking age is not working and specifically that it has created a culture of dangerous binge drinking on their campuses

5709896 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who has known the mind of the lord or who has become his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be repaid to him for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen
5709897 of him and through him and to him are all things
5709898 i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end
5709899 all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things and in him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he may have the preeminence
5709900 there is one god the father of whom are all things and we for him
5709901 although they knew god they did not glorify him as god and changed the glory of the incorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man
5709902 and it shall come to pass that everyone who is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts
5709903 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
5709904 saving faith includes repentance repentance is not doing anything it is not a deed act work or rite rather it is a change of the direction of ones heart it basically means an attitude of the heart in turning from sin and self and turning to god thats what paul was referring to in acts 20 21 when he referred to repentance toward god and faith in our lord jesus christ saving faith is the human heart turning to god and then trusting in jesus christ even as there is the part of trusting christ there is also the part of turning to him that may seem inconsequential but i believe that here is a spiritual reason they some go through the motions of believing in christ but are not really born again they seemingly want the fire escape but there is no interest in turning to god there is no interest in repentance they have the attitude god gimme salvation but im gonna keep on doing my own thing however if there is no real turning to god from the heart they have missed the prerequisite for actually trusting christ
5709905 repentance is included in believing howbeit repentance is not faith nor faith repentance he that believeth implies repentance repent and be converted involves faith the hand that clutches the assassins knife must open ere it can grasp the gift its intended victim proffers and opening that hand though a single act has a double aspect and purpose accepting the gift implies a turning from the crime the heart was bent on and it was the gift itself that worked the change faith is the open hand relatively to the gift repentance is the same hand relatively not only to the gift but more especially to the dagger that is flung from it repentance is one threefold action in the understanding knowledge of sin in the feelings pain and grief in the will a change of mind and a turning around
5709906 while it is true that upwards of one hundred and fifteen n t passages condition salvation on believing and fully thirty passages condition salvation on faith nevertheless repentance is an essential condition in gods glorious gospel it is also true that in the last analysis repentance and faith are one and the same act ye turned to god from idols 1 th 1 9 repentance is included in believing howbeit repentance is not faith nor faith repentance he that believeth implies repentance repent and be converted involves faith repentance and faith can never be separated repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ ac 20 21 ye repented not that ye might believe him mt 21 32 repentance is denying negative faith is affirming positive repentance looks within faith looks above repentance sees our misery faith our deliverer repentance is hunger faith is the open mouth and christ is the living food
5709907 repentance never saved a soul by its merits it lays the needful foundation for the temple of faith in the heart
5709908 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it

5709913 smes are a vibrant and creative sector of the economy so theyre ideally placed to be climate change entrepreneurs
5709914 shells planning scenario planning suggests that in the future we will be reliant on a mix of a number of different energy sources and energy saving technologies
5709915 grassroots innovation from small businesses could be a crucial factor in driving the development of this mix
5709916 id urge smes operating in this field to give serious consideration to the springboard programme
5709917 programmes like shell springboard encourage small and medium sized businesses to seize the issue of climate change as a commercial opportunity that should be embraced
5709918 tfls initial findings show that london is already benefiting from reduced emissions as a result of the introduction of the low emission zone
5709919 during the next three years we wish to place a statutory duty upon our local authorities to promote culture and the arts
5709920 im confident that the change will be a means by which the status of culture can be raised in the activities of local authorities currently the pattern varies too greatly across wales
5709921 we know there is resistance to any more duties being imposed on councils in england and statutory requirement without adequate budgets will not be a great improvement so we are watching the outcome in wales with great interest
5709922 we hope any duty to provide will come with the funding to make it effective if that can be achieved there will be a strong case for england to follow suit
5709923 i think we like the idea that someone is putting the emphasis and importance on delivery of the arts what we would like to know is how does that translate into action on the ground we would welcome knowing more about it
5709924 observed that the market is well supplied with current commercial oil stocks standing above their five year average the conference further noted with concern that the current price environment does not reflect market fundamentals as crude oil prices are being strongly influenced by the weakness in the us dollar rising inflation and significant flow of funds into the commodities market

5709928 due to their environmental significance and sensitivity many water based and land based features within the city of kelowna have already been designated as natural environment development permit areas
5709929 overall the proposed amendment would see the removal of 62 properties from the development permit areas while including an additional 686 properties
5709930 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
5709931 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
5709932 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
5709933 approximately 1800 new boat slips will be added over the next five years with 1400 of those for private use in addition there are plans for dock storage for 315 boats with the potential for more
5709934 we found 77 what we called points of interest and narrowed that down to 47 those could be anything from a boat launch to a marina to mooring buoys
5709935 i think this re establishes what some of us on city council have been saying for quite a while that we have a major shortage of facilities for boats im kind of shocked about 40 per cent of the people have some sort of boat which is very eye opening
5709936 just thinking of alternative places of storing trailers i think we really need to be out of the box on that there is the notion of valet service
5709937 i think of schools for example and all the parking lots that are vacant in the summertime maybe the school district could make a deal to rent parking lots and putting some money back into the school system
5709938 city council is seeking greater clarity in the judgment the court determined that the covenant is not valid but does exist as a charitable trust
5709939 the city will ask the appeal court to clarify whether it is possible to create a trust under common law
5709940 the city will ask the appeal court to rule on whether a charitable trust can be established when land is not gifted the city purchased the land in 1946
5709941 city council is committed to preserving public ownership and public access to the waterfront land and the city hall site
5709942 at the time it wasnt clear if there was damage to the beams its taken some time to determine that and an approximate value
5709943 as i was passing a pickup truck in the other lane a dog riding in the back jumped out of the vehicle it was tied to the truck with a long length of chain
5709944 it was just awful i turned around to help the owners but the dog was covered in blood he was limp and lifeless when i got to them the owners were in shock one of them called 911 because the owners didnt know what else to do i gave them the number and directions for a local vet but i dont know what happened after that
5709945 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5709946 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5709947 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5709948 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw
5709949 its really motivated me to organize some educational clinics on pet safety in a blink of eye people can lose their pet if they dont know how to properly secure them id like to help make them aware of how to do that

5709966 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
5709967 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government

5709971 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
5709972 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
5709973 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
5709974 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
5709975 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
5709976 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5709977 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5709978 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5709979 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer

5709994 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground
5709995 the best thing you have to do is ask what are the criteria these funds are using
