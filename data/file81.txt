810000 one of the things thats different about an initiative is that a candidate can make a big mistake that takes the entire agenda of that candidate down with an initiative i think californias ability for citizens to come together to put prop 2 on the ballot and be part of the critical group on funding and organizing it to win its unique to california in many ways
810001 in the signature gathering process we had 4 000 volunteers gather 500 000 signatures
810002 if each signature costs at least a dollar to get thats 500 000 we saved from just tapping our volunteer base
810003 this is a cynical attempt by a governor who has spent the past few weeks going up and down the state criticizing others for political posturing
810004 will continue to have sufficient cash to make all payments including state payroll through september cutting workers salaries will do nothing meaningful to improve our cash position or help us make our priority payments
810005 the budget has affected our folks because a lot of them are now gone
810006 theyve been told their services are no longer needed departments anticipating the cuts went ahead and did it layoffs already
810007 zero interest short term loans and extensions of loan payments for schools members who are not receiving their regular paychecks due to the budget impasse
810008 we were founded by state employees they are the people who have supported and grown this institution and we want to give back
810009 they have earned the most benefit by supporting us all these years
810010 desire to live and build their homes in known hazardous areas
810011 the commission is focusing more on approaches that require new development to avoid hazardous areas
810012 we believe that almost all the chaparral within the coastal zone would be maritime chaparral with very few exceptions
810013 we wanted to do the traditional lets celebrate people who are making a difference in california thats pretty straightforward
810014 the other piece of our program is to use the awards to draw attention to these kinds of solutions so that others might see some merit in their approach these groups were selected for taking a new approach to a problem that we really hadnt seen before
810015 we all can learn from their positive spirit and their successful approaches in their respective fields and i thank them for their valuable contributions to our state
810016 these were all people looking for big solutions to significant challenges facing california
810017 first and foremost was effectiveness this is not about up and comers or groups we think are going to be great
810018 we think all of these groups represent a new way of thinking about a particular problem and the hope is that some of this thinking can be replicated even in other areas
810019 we talk to people who are not even aware of the argument not aware of the issues
810020 we hope to reach people that are not yet even in the orbit of the debate
810021 we have secured exclusive interviews some of the worlds favorite bigots osama bin laden who has been very hard to find another one of our very favorite bigots is saddam hussein kim jong il has also weighed in
810022 this group of advocates are the same type of people who have tried to intimidate people who support prop 8 by calling them hateful things such as in the title of their committee
810023 the reality is that the majority of californians support marriage being between a man and a woman so i hope theyre not calling the majority of californians bigots
810024 there are a lot of people who have been here a long time who have already been recommended to members who have pretty safe seats
810025 ive been lucky i worked for one member for four years and now ive worked for my current boss for ten years
810026 i was fortunate i had an assembly member who was a great boss and once you have that youre a little reluctant to roll the dice at that point
810027 people are nervous especially the first timers are worried theyre just feeling their way through hoping to land someplace good
810028 theres a tendency to feel pressured and have a sense of urgency but its still very early in the process
810029 some people are more worried than they need to be
810030 new members will need to staff their offices and they will try to hire people who were already staffers
810031 people are getting tired of filling out the paperwork every year just to get their money
810032 there is no question that california needs a long term water management strategy
810033 but first we must address our immediate needs fixing the deltas fragile eco system our deteriorating levees and our stressed water supply californians approved billions of dollars in 2006 to fix these and other problems we owe it to voters to put these funds to work now
810034 this latest bond proposal shares many similarities to one i put up for a vote last september before the state encountered its current fiscal crisis
810035 i am open to doing a water bond first however the state should spend the bond money voters approved in 2006 and then we must pass a responsible budget that can pay for the debt service on a new bond
810036 launching a peripheral canal without addressing ecosystem water quality structure and governance simply enflames old sectional passions and suspicions
810037 it should be an issue that is facing farmers and business people ordinary people everybody is suffering when we have no water
810038 let us all work together and go send that message to the legislatures to come up with a water bill once and for all to fix our systems we owe it to the people of california
810039 last year we did have low rainfall on top of the previous year which had near record low levels for rainfall
810040 the governor calling it a drought however carries no legal significance under california law its interesting though that he calls a drought and then a couple of weeks later he calls for a new water bond
810041 something like a temperance flat reservoir will only supply farmers in large agriculture fields in the central valley only a few will benefit from this
810042 one of the things that different about growing grapes as opposed to say tomatoes youre going it for the intensity of the flavor of the grape
810043 in many parts of the north coast wine grapes are the dominant land use
810044 its the cumulative effect of many small diversions that wouldnt by themselves be a big deal
810045 those that have their permits are good to go those who dont there will be no new vineyards
810046 it will inhibit the ability of my industry to expand at all
810047 wed like to have a system that would bring those people into the fold and also doesnt punish people who are playing by the rules
810048 i dont think the average farmer likes the idea of operating illegally
810049 she really did have to look at her holdings and get rid of ones that could be considered a conflict
810050 a whirlwind it all happened very quickly she just didnt look at her financial holdings at the time
810051 i think its important to avoid a conflict of interest or even an appearance of a conflict of interest
810052 i think its a legitimate question but i dont have a good answer to it
810053 we havent gotten into saying what we want public officials to invest in beyond avoiding a conflict of interest i dont feel a lot of solid grounding in us telling people what they should do with their own money
810054 what she does in her capacity as chairwoman is tremendously important but it would be unfair to intone that she couldnt have a financial portfolio for her family and her children and her grandchildren so they can have a comfortable living later on in life its not at odds with running the california air resources board
810055 theres certainly not a direct conflict there every company is going to be affected by the actions of the air resources board in some fashion
810056 do we want to disqualify people from serving because of their interests
810057 provides onshore contract drilling services to exploration and production companies in north america the company has approximately 350 currently marketable land based drilling rigs
810058 primary business activity is international seaborne transportation of crude oil
810059 a leader in the gathering processing storage and transportation of natural gas in the u s and owns one of the nations premier natural gas liquids ngl systems connecting much of the natural gas and ngl supply in the mid continent with key market centers
810060 his focus is different and hes not going to play football anymore hes just going to stress his academics and graduate in december we respect his decision we know its been a difficult one for him and one that he has thought a great deal about were disappointed to see him leave and wish him the best
810061 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
810062 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron james it could be dwyane wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
810063 youve got to learn guys tendencies and get used to guys
810064 but its pretty easy with this group because they all know how to play the game they all know how to move without the ball and so its pretty easy to find someone out there
810065 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
810066 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
810067 rainer schuettler claims that he should be allowed to compete in the games considering that he has been entered by the german noc national olympic committee and that he is eligible as a result of his position in the itf computer ranking due to the withdrawal of some players who were qualified for the olympic tournament
810068 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents
810069 luckily she was able to give me her name i grabbed her and ran to the gates but it was too late
810070 it is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child this never happens
810071 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents
810072 luckily she was able to give me her name i grabbed her and ran to the gates but it was too late
810073 oh well i didnt see it i think its kinda stupid
810074 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
810075 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
810076 im a conservative progressive and that means i think all men are equal whether they be
810077 have a natural instinct for rhythm and for singing and dancing
810078 the negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint thats thus far left him free to clog the streets disrupt traffic and
810079 mmhmm yep i dont see what the big oh god thats disgusting
810080 oh yeah we have so much fresh water to drink that we dont know what to do with it
810081 seals are supposed to be playful and loveable not viscious
810082 its a good thing steven spielberg is dead or im sure hed make a movie about them coming to the rescue of potential shark victims
810083 do you want a president whos as vapid and crazy as this chick and her former no underwear wearing friend huh do you
810084 amys camp takes offense at statements made by the press that its weird that she has a camp of people sleeping in her front yard
810085 thanks dude youve released what the press is consistently calling a silly juvenile ad and our girl is front and center in it so grateful
810086 hey remember that ad that compared me to the president of the united states
810087 ama de casa si lo haces y ganas m s que ellos se enojan
810088 does every christian family move to canada if obama is elected or is it just everyone on my daddys side
810089 is obama really gonna make momma get an abortion i wanted a little brother and she promised to make one for me
810090 how is my daddy going to get his money for retirement if obama is going to take it all and give it to the negroes
810091 does obama have an extra bone in his ankle that makes him jump higher when he plays basketball
810092 are all the people who dont vote for john mccain really going to burn in hell and be hiney sized by demons
810093 is the obama going to send the rappers to get my mommy
810094 im saving myslef for maragie is obama going to make me have sex with my girlfriend and smoke marniguana and cigarittes before im old enough
810095 im so scared of obama is that dirty dark monster still outside of my bathroom window watching me tinkle is he going to bite my head off and feed it to the puff daddy like momma says
810096 how comes a colored person is allowed to be a president
810097 whats a vagina my creation science teacher edna mae says obama will make her teach students about them and spray hers on everyone in class or else she might lose her credidations
810098 if obama gets elected is he going to kill all the white people or make them slaveries
810099 will obama make my daddy pay monique more money to clean my bedroom
810100 if obama gets elected is there gonna be more negroes everywhere even on my lacrosse team and in my tree fort
810101 momma says june gordon is voting for obama because he has a giant penis and she likes getting rapped by negroes why is a hore like that beach still allowed in our church
810102 does obama think my daddy makes too much money is obama gonna give daddys money to mr cecil so he can buy cracked cains mom says obama wants to make her stamp her food why
810103 dads being saying this word lots when he reads about the obama so how is a neeg rahr look it sounds scary is it like a lion
810104 my daddy made my sister move away cause said she is voting for obama is she going to be okay he hit her in the head with the bible i am not allowed to help her because daddy said she is no better than a mexican and there aint no mexicans in this christian family
810105 if obama gets elected will the coloreds move to our neighborhood
810106 is rushian limbargh gonna get christians to stop obama before he gets to the whites ony house and takes controls of the social securities
810107 its the sweetest of moments when the fire takes control and youre no longer responsible for anything
810108 its my own property but im not allowed to go in the water
810109 it was a social gathering place and a very nice place to swim
810110 the days where theres an old swimming hole that everybody can just go and use without permission those days are gone
810111 people bought houses built piers bought boats fished swam ice skated did all the usual things you would do if you had a waterfront property and that continued for decades
810112 under the law theyre entitled to that they bought and paid for it
810113 weve been generous all these years in allowing them to use our property
810114 if you lived next to a golf course does that give you the right to go over there and play golf any time you want to
810115 im too old and i havent got money to fight anything
810116 whats fair about being blasted out of my own house
810117 the legislature put the sunset provision in law for a reason
810118 were a little reluctant to see that changed the way that this bill proposes to change it
810119 it wasnt that the wanted to see the board sunset it was because he didnt want to see that committee created
810120 the appointment of the executive director is politicized theyre going to try to get people appointed to those positions who share their point of view
810121 the way the bill is written now literally everything would have to go in the public record
810122 suddenly everything would become a legal document it would just stifle communication isolate the board from the public and licensees and make enforcement of the law extremely cumbersome
810123 there have been concerns raised by some of the professions but recent amendments being proposed may address some of those concerns especially those dealing with the ex parte communications requirement
810124 a good example for why this bill is needed is the chiropractic board
810125 it took a lot of time and effort of the standing committees to deal with the problems of this board communications between members of those of the profession were inappropriate and sometimes in violation of the bagley keene act if disclosure of ex parte communications were required some of these problems would possibly not have occurred
810126 it did pass the last house senate last year but it didnt look anything like this
810127 the public has lost faith in the leaders ability to deal with the state budget crisis so how would you solve the budget crisis
810128 politicians are just a bunch of little boys and girls too now who never growed up anyway
810129 i think the board needed to take action as soon as possible
810130 when the new chair comes in and essentially we have a new board in the next few months they can begin moving forward with the management team that they find reliable
810131 the basic problem with this agency is that senior management doesnt seem to understand that we are here to run this program for the benefit of the public not for the benefit of themselves
810132 absolutely not i dont care as long as they make it clear that they are not representing their opinions as those of the board
810133 termination of cea career executive assignment appointment executive director alj
810134 it is premature to take an action against the executive officer until the audit is completed and there has been an opportunity for an independent entity to gather and do the necessary evaluation of the facts involved
810135 there are clearly serious concerns about how the board has handled various issues over the past year and the impact these actions have had on staff and the services they provide
810136 the final straw for me came when i learned of the longstanding practice of delaying decisions resulting in the delay of benefits to the unemployed as a budget gimmick designed to ensure that the board would be flush with cash even though our unemployed claimants would have their benefits delayed
810137 federal standards call for 60 percent of cases to be resolved in 30 days california currently only resolves 6 percent of its cases in 30 days and we continue to have a backlog of 46 000 cases
810138 the fact that a man is a newspaper reporter is evidence of some flaw of character
810139 its fairly common in some asian communities where they consume bear bile as a general elixir health supplement
810140 the role in our lab is to determine if it is bear
810141 we may get a case with 40 or 50 meat samples and you dont know what species are there
810142 usually what we do on animal attack is that we examine the victims outer garments to see if we can identify anything indicating a lion attacked the person
810143 so things well look for would be holes in clothing hairs or saliva from the lion but in this case we didnt see any of that
810144 wed get clothing where somebody most likely ripped at it themselves and claimed they were attacked by a lion to get attention
810145 forensics science is a very powerful law enforcement tool but is also expensive to conduct the less money you have to work with means essentially you can work fewer cases
810146 a lot of suspects plead guilty in the field to a fish and game warden when the wardens say they are going to send all the meat to the lab to figure out what exactly it is the person will get scared and just admit to it
810147 theres always been poaching but as general groups of people come in they tend to target different types of species for instance we do a lot of cases with sturgeon poaching where people of russian or ex soviet union descent involved but not always we have to be careful in saying theyre not profiling anyone
810148 of course if the same person or family sometimes gets cited three or four times for the same violation
810149 without environmental laws or state enforcement on poaching well end up like other countries where there is no wildlife left look at africa or india where their tigers and elephants only exist now on very few areas of protected land so if future generations of people want to see wildlife anywhere other than a zoo poaching is an issue that needs to be addressed
810150 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
810151 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue
810152 what would odienator do if he were running for president and this shit happened to him
810153 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
810154 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
810155 there has been a recent increase in confrontational incidents in the vicinity of the capitol and lob
810156 there were enough incidents that the chp felt justified in warning staff that the capitol area is not a safe place after dark
810157 when you have a warm weather city like sacramento its going to be a magnet for homeless people
810158 some of the homeless people are going to be troubled
810159 don has said publicly that were going to have a vote next week the goal is to have something on the governors desk by august 1 thats a very important deadline in terms of the states cash situation
810160 the importance of having an independent journalism that played a watchdog function is extremely important in keeping government honest and responsive
810161 one of the questions is will media be commercially viable or does it need some kind of non profit component or model to survive
810162 people are starting to turn to see where the sugar daddies are
810163 foundations are sitting on huge pots of money and they exist to give them away so its a natural place to go
810164 the question is can we get together and find a way to make it happen
810165 would be a home for journalism in all sorts of media print audio and video and also be a platform for discussion commentary and blogs on california issues the goal is to connect people and interested citizens and issue discussions to be a tool for california citizens
810166 were a training work shop we were approached by the foundation to develop a training program for working reporters and how to better cover public affairs we are actually out there trying to improve that coverage
810167 it s the responsibility of people who run media organizations to provide the space or airtime to inform people
810168 its one thing to train reporters and another to get those decision makers to devote more space to the reporting that comes out of that process
810169 were going to tackle that one face to face one at a time
810170 i keep reading stories from july 11th thinking theyre new
810171 you can write something and nobody may see it if it doesnt get play on rough and tumble
810172 its the homepage on my browser so its really been distressing to see it missing when i open up my internet each morning
810173 everybody i know checks jacks website several times through the day both to know whats going on and to see what everyone else is doing its like a news blackout with jack being gone
810174 aside from being concerned for jack i was thinking to myself this morning that its one of those things that you dont realize how much you need it until its gone theres definitely a hole in my morning when im drinking my coffee
810175 when the bill goes down to the governor it will have fewer and narrower exemptions than when the senate passed it
810176 it goes beyond what private companies have to do but at the same time it does provides protection for confidential information
810177 not one there is no contract that state fund is involved in that they are obligation to tell the public about
810178 its state fund leadership who has invoked sarbannes oxley as a model
810179 we wanted to make sure that exemption wasnt exempting us from being able to get the policyholder information
810180 we worked out some language with them that we seemed to think solved the problem of our agents
810181 youve got to remember the private sector failed a decade ago
810182 its just not going to be possible for one person to monitor five or six checkout lines without someone slipping by
810183 i think its a prescription for increasing underage consumption a recipe for more binge drinking
810184 abc staff indicates that they have no evidence of any problems associated with minors purchasing alcoholic beverages through self service checkouts
810185 we have not seen evidence of a systematic problem in the industry with allowing consumers to conduct part of those transactions on their own
810186 weve gotten no complaints about their use leading to sales to minors
810187 im not going to say theyre not doing something good by providing some food choices that werent there before but theyre targeting neighborhood that are also targeted by alcohol companies
810188 in most small stores there will be one extremely bored clerk per four terminals
810189 they need to boost their capacity to be attractive for funding we will help them with capacity building programs and leadership development its about getting minority organizations to a point where they will be better able to handle a foundation grant to serve their constituency
810190 there are certain areas we thought were very very important
810191 and those included increasing the number of minority kids who go into university and increasing the support they need to graduate which is important to our community and for california
810192 the bill would have placed burdensome reporting requirements on already stretched nonprofits without increasing resources to them it could have limited the growth of philanthropy in the state
810193 this compromise will strengthen the existing and longstanding commitments of these individual foundations to low income under served communities
810194 large organizations were just not making themselves accessible to minority led organizations in the state
810195 this did not mandate giving to a certain cause or group its just about transparency which leads to more effective governance business and in this case philanthropy
810196 how long until my employees innovate without even thinking about it
810197 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
810198 i dont think the next president will do that no matter who he is
810199 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
810200 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
810201 pardon any official from cabinet secretary on down who might plausibly face prosecution
810202 a lot of people think that that is not something that goes over well with the american people
810203 what we have much more of a tradition of is presidential fact finding commissions
810204 something like this would be unprecedented in the american experience and i think it would be absolutely necessary
810205 presidential commissions and national security the politics of damage control
810206 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems
810207 but nothing in terms of looking at an issue that has this array of legal moral and even spiritual questions attached to it
810208 foreigners must respect chinese laws while in china and must not harm chinas national security or damage social order
810209 foreign students like to stay out all night on the weekend but in more intellectual and traditional chinese households there is no way the kids would go out like that
810210 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
810211 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
810212 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
810213 you want people to think well of you dont you

810267 gli infortunati nostri e loro non sono alibi e i giallorossi non si fermeranno
810268 speriamo di essere in forma afferma il presidente ai microfoni di italia 1 necessario essere in gran forma perch questo finale di stagione ci presenta impegni non facili la stagione stata lunga ma ora dobbiamo stringere i denti e tenere duro fino alla fine
810269 sia noi che la roma siamo stati bersagliati dagli infortuni questo non vuole essere un alibi ma sono comunque dei dati di fatto reali purtroppo spesso si sono infortunati giocatori importanti e nel medesimo ruolo e quindi non stato possibile fare turnover non bisogna far finta di niente anche se non vuol dire che ci piangiamo addosso o che non giochiamo anzi dovr essere il modo per caricarsi e per giocare ancora meglio
810270 anche se la roma aveva tante assenze pensavo potesse fare un risultato migliore ma stata anche sfortunata poi in questo momento le squadre inglesi sono fortissime

810273 fairfax county remains one of the most efficient local governments in the country since fiscal year 1991 the ratio of county employees per resident has fallen from 13 57 employees for every 1 000 residents to 11 15 employees per 1 000 in fiscal year 2005
810274 all but the few anarchists among us recognize that effective liberty requires some government if only to define and protect rights to life and property beyond a point however bigger government begins to cut into our liberties then the growth of government becomes synonymous with the sacrifice of liberty in the united states we entered this stage a long time ago
810275 when we say that government has grown what do we mean government is not a single thing measurable along a scale like inches of height or pounds of weight the size of government can change in different dimensions many of them incommensurable
810276 but that glorious day in my judgment is not yet in sight
810277 the single goal and raison detre of limited government in the misesian system the pragmatic lessons of economic science joined with a passionate regard for individual freedom point unequivocally to the classically liberal system of private ownership of the means of production
810278 utterly missing in this election season is a serious focus on limited or constitutional government
810279 to talk about seven proposition related to the problem of limited government in our day
810280 finds that larger levels of government spending are associated with slower growth and economic stagnation
810281 regardless of their political affiliation politicians in washington behave as if bigger government is desirable yet this means economic stagnation this new study shows that a limited government is the route to more prosperity
810282 the burden of government spending in the united states has grown considerably since 2000 but this is just the calm before the storm
810283 instead of allowing government to grow policy makers should focus on how best to shrink the public sector academic research clearly shows that government spending once it reaches above the level needed to finance core responsibilities such as the rule of law hinders economic growth by misallocating labor and capital indeed there is even a well established relationship illustrated by the rahn curve showing how larger levels of government spending are associated with slower growth and economic stagnation researchers do not agree on the precise number but there is general agreement that the growth maximizing level of government is between 15 percent of gdp and 25 percent of gdp far below current levels
810284 if you come to a fork in the road take it
810285 lawmakers in the first session of the 110th congress introduced more savings bills than recent congresses but for each single step toward fiscal responsibility with a bill to reduce the federal budget representatives and senators introduced 22 bills and 30 bills respectively to increase it
810286 although there are some signs that more lawmakers in the 110th congress are seeking out ways to trim expenditures these steps have been halting and erratic the majority of congressional members sponsor a mix of legislation that would on net result in new spending thereby increasing the strain on the budget and the burden on taxpayers
810287 excluding overlapping legislation if the house passed all of the bills introduced in 2007 annual federal outlays would add a burden of 14 802 to every household a 1 7 trillion increase overall in the senate all non overlapping bills would pile an additional 9 857 on every household a 1 1 trillion total increase
810288 theres no way in hell i would support banning earmarks thats our job getting elected and making decisions yes there are bad earmarks like there are bad members of congress and what you do is get rid of them
810289 before the 1980s congress would fund general grant programs and let federal and state agencies select individual recipients through a competitive process or formula the house and senate appropriations committees named specific projects only when they had been the subject of hearings and approved by authorizing committees members of congress with local concerns would lobby the president and federal agencies for consideration the normal budget process which is aimed at preventing abuse and allocating resources on the basis of merit and need has become a sideshow in the scramble by individual appropriations committee members to pick winners and losers based on seniority
810290 this bill is a hodgepodge of 35 different bills totaling more than 11 billion in new spending at the very least this bill deserves a deliberate debate and should be amendable according to the latest news reports senate majority leader harry reid will allow neither
810291 this bill contains such questionable programs like 17 million for the prevention of the interstate sale of monkeys 1 5 billion for the largest earmark in the country that could force tax hikes in the dc metro area and a greenhouse in maryland and yet there will be no time to debate this bill or offer amendments to strike certain provisions of the bill or to offset its overall cost with cuts in spending elsewhere in the budget contrary to its name this bill does not advance our countrys priorities instead it forces special interest goodies through the senate without any meaningful consideration about its merits
810292 raises serious questions about how the senate will proceed in the future
810293 using every parliamentary tactic at his disposal coburn has tied the senate in so many knots that majority leader harry m reid d nev has decided on an extraordinary tactic he will devote most of the senates time this week to breaking the one man stranglehold
810294 rolling 35 bills into one omnibus package reid will try to leap all of coburns parliamentary hurdles at once and win approval for dozens of programs worth more than 10 billion
810295 senate republicans yesterday blocked consideration of 35 bills that were rolled into one omnibus measure designed to overcome the objections of sen tom coburn d okla who has used parliamentary tactics to stymie dozens of pieces of legislation
810296 siding with coburn most republicans voted against bringing up the omnibus bill worth more than 10 billion contending that it would take debate time away from energy legislation and efforts to bring down gasoline prices
810297 a chokehold or stranglehold is a grappling hold that strangles the opponent and leads to unconsciousness or even death they are generally considered superior compared to brute force manual strangling
810298 the word also refers to an occupied state where the occupiers severely prevent any kind of civil rights quelling all opposition and or resistance

810307 well the latest irs data have arrived on who paid what share of income taxes in 2006 and its going to be hard for the rich to pay any more than they already do the data show that the 2003 bush tax cuts caused what may be the biggest increase in tax payments by the rich in american history
810308 the way to soak the rich is with low tax rates and last weeks irs data provide more powerful validation of that proposition

810310 plays a critical role in dod contractor oversight by providing auditing accounting and financial advisory services in connection with the negotiation administration and settlement of contracts and subcontracts dcaa also performs audit services for other federal agencies as requested on a fee for service basis
810311 in the cases we investigated pressure from the contracting community and buying commands for favorable opinions to support contract negotiations impaired the independence of three audits involving two of the five largest government contractors in addition dcaa management pressure to 1 complete audit work on time in order to meet performance metrics and 2 report favorable opinions so that work could be reduced on future audits and contractors could be approved for direct billing privileges led the three dcaa field audit offices to take inappropriate short cuts ultimately resulting in noncompliance with gagas and internal dcaa contract audit manual guidance
810312 poor planning by virginias transportation bureaucrats has led to a gaff that will likely cost taxpayers many millions more than initially projected so what else is new and we may be obligated to pay for that gaff for the next 40 years
810313 virginia transportation officials celebrated the start of construction today with a symbolic groundbreaking atop a parking garage overlooking the states busiest road
810314 but under an agreement virginia signed with the private companies building high occupancy toll lanes on the capital beltway the state could be liable for millions of dollars a year if too many carpoolers who will be exempt from tolls use the lanes
810315 the carpool subsidy is in addition to the 409 million that taxpayers are investing in the 2 billion 14 mile project expected to break ground next week
810316 under the 80 year contract signed in december when gas prices were much lower virginia officials insisted that carpools of three or more people and buses be allowed to use the lanes for free and offered to reimburse 70 percent of the tolls carpoolers didnt pay
810317 at the time transportation officials estimated that the provision would cost the state 1 million a year the carpool subsidy will continue for 40 years or until the builders make 100 million in profits according to the contract between virginia and transurban an australian company and flour corp of texas the subsidy kicks in when carpools exceed 24 percent of the traffic on the lanes
810318 apparently these officials were the only people in the country who could not predict that gas prices would go up even though this is a trend that has been going on for the past several years

810347 the syntaxonomy of maritime chaparral has not been formally studied hence arguments as to the identity of a particular stand of chaparral as either falling within or without such a category is subject to the vacillation of personal opinion
810348 people will have their land effectively condemned based upon the personal opinion of one person the expert the county or commission requires them to hire to do a biological assessment of their property as part of the permit process it seems you couldnt find a more arbitrary and vague system for designating which land is esha and therefore essentially unusable
810349 at the end of the day this process really falls on the head of some unlucky property owner
810350 even when everybody could see the fire was raging they said we had to get permits to cut people didnt have a choice they had to get permits finally the firefighters jumped right in and of course they helped the property owners remove trees it shouldnt take a disaster like this to put some sense into the process
810351 destroyed in an hour or two more maritime chaparral than all the residents of big sur could clear if they worked for 100 years unfortunately if the coastal commission persists in protecting maritime chaparral from being cleared it also wont be long before a lot more homes go up in smoke
810352 the central message here for us is that the maritime chaparral like the san diego coast sage shrub are not just fire prone they are fire dependent they have evolved over a millenium to require fire to regenerate they have to burn they will burn

810365 climate change is or could be the additional factor which will exacerbate the existing problems of poverty environmental degradation social polarisation and terrorism and it could lead to a very chaotic situation
810366 a situation where the rich live in enclaves protected and the poor live outside in unsustainable conditions
810367 ultimately climate change is a threat to humanity as a whole but it is the poor a constituency with no responsibility for the ecological debt we are running up who face the immediate and most severe human costs

810450 the confidence is there i think after a race like that even with the bad result at the end with two laps to go it still counts what we did in the race
810451 we showed a great performance a great pace and great teamwork that is very good for the next races
810452 i think we could have done the race a little bit better but we were stuck behind alonso
810453 i was stuck behind him until the second stop so it was a bit late by that point i had a good car and i was able to catch timo glock but i had to back off in one moment
810454 we were a bit lucky with some of the other guys we have the speed but if we cannot get qualifying fixed then we will have the same problems we have to sort it out
810455 if we can be in front we can fight for wins the guys did a good job but we need to fix the problems and for sure we can be back in the hunt for wins
810456 i think i did the best of the worst if you like in the end
810457 i had no idea about the puncture and the team did a great job to help me back into that race and last year i think i lost the championship because of punctures
810458 but congratulations to heikki who drove a great race and he deserves his win we have taken points from our rivals today and made the best of things it could have been a whole lot worse

810505 twenty years ago personal trainers were afraid to do any kind of real strenuous training with older adults
810506 they were so cautious that the exercises they were doing were often not even effective
810507 they want to be independent for as long as they can be and they know that physical fitness is a big part of that

810561 lucha libre or free wrestling is one of mexicos most popular sports its stars can make a lucrative living but it is very much a mans game
810562 an understanding of morrisons work requires immersion in ways of knowing to borrow nellie mckays phrase that are not necessarily a part of the western tradition african and african american myth and language african american musical traditions of the spirituals blues and jazz alternative approaches to history religion ancestry culture specific concepts and philosophical ideas of time and cosmology that are often opposed to traditional western concepts and many more
810563 the double voicedness of the african american text consequently requires that african american writing be approached in a similarly double manner one that is cognizant both of the specifically african features of the writing but also the western or anglo european features of that writing only such a double vision is capable of perceiving and interpreting the manner in which the text moves between the two traditions
810564 though morrison resists clarifying what precisely her principles are her increasingly voluminous critical writings reveal four main elements that seem to constitute the essence of black writing for her the presence of displacement or alienation a close relationship between author and reader an oral quality to the voice of the text and at the formal level a quality of music in the writing that is distinctively black when these elements come together in the work of art they produce morrisons own aesthetic ideal
810565 toni morrison claims that writing is a craft that appears solitary but needs another for its completion
810566 is the participation of the other that is the audience the reader
810567 my writing expects demands participatory reading and that i think that is what literature is supposed to do its not just about retelling the story its about involving the reader
810568 for morrison this means restoring the oral quality of the language and making it imitate as closely as possible
810569 reaffirmation of community is one of the hallmarks of black english
810570 spontaneous verbal and nonverbal interaction between speaker and listener in which all of the speaker statements calls are punctuated by expressions responses from the listener
810571 response allows the caller to know that the audience approves of what she is saying and how she is saying it it is immediate validation
810572 morrison allows the reader to become part of the circle of storytelling and thereby witnesses
810573 the great truism of morrison scholarship is that her primary theme is community certainly each novel rigorously engages such issues as what constitutes a community what functions communities serve what threatens the community what help skits survive as morrison herself has said if anything she does in the way of writing novels isnt about the village or the community or about you then it is not about anything
810574 pecola is destroyed within her very community and that community not only fails to aid her they have helped cause her isolation
810575 it was the fault of the earth the land our town i even think now that the land of the entire country was hostile to marigolds that year the soil is bad for certain kinds of flowers certain seeds it will not nurture certain fruits it will not bear and when the land kills of its own volition we acquiesce and say the victim had no right to live
810576 is one of the dumbest most pernicious and destructiveideas of the western world and we should have nothing to do with it
810577 is a way of measuring worth that is wholly trivial and wholly white and preoccupation with it is an irrevocable slavery of the senses
810578 one of the most destructive ideas in the history of human thought
810579 to look at a face and not assign its a category in the scale of absolute beauty
810580 a needless cul de sac an opiate that eventually must separate us from reality
810581 critics have been fascinated by morrisons treatment of the destructive devaluing power of white standards of beauty but few have tried to describe the alternative approach to beauty that she offers
810582 in this essay i show how morrison draws our attention away from the visual the static the remote or idealized object towards an experience of physical beauty that is tangible and improvisational relational and contextual involving mutual efforts to feel as well as see morrison does not merely circumvent western aesthetic standards but invents entirely original ways to approach the beautiful as work or process in her narratives beauty depends on the beholders craft or intention and results from labor upon the body either by the hands or the imagination
810583 morrisons emphasis on the tactile over the visual conveys an implicit challenge to the western aesthetic fascination with sight and corresponding degradation of touch aristotle considered touch the most lowly animalistic sensation and renaissance theorists echoed him to vincenzio borghini touch seemed bestial compared to sight the most crude and most material of the senses leon battista alberti chose as his emblem a winged eye explaining that the eye was an obvious symbol of super mystique more powerful than anything swifter more worthy it is such as to be the first chief king like the god of human parts
810584 in general the discourse on aesthetics has endowed the visual faculty with objectivity autonomy and hence dominion because visual sensation covers remote distances its reach is considered lordly and authoritative whereas tactile sensation limited to the local in specific seems lowly by comparison
810585 beauty takes place in morrisons novels when some active imagination makes the bodys unforeseen beauty suddenly apparent thus for morrison the experience of beauty is much more subjective and dynamic than its visual static dimension would suggest beauty is ultimately provides a subtle and unaccountable unpredictable response and beauty is narrational for morrison is uninterested in any notion of beauty unmediated by fantasy storyline the contingencies of context for kant the beauty of an object must be distinct from the fictions that it inspires whereas for morrison the aesthetic object cannot be disassociated from the montage of perceptions whereby it comes to be both felt and imagined
810586 by reminding us of the contributions of imagination to the appreciation of the body morrison suggests that responsiveness creates the experience of beauty rather than the usual notion that physical beauty preexist it elicits a response
810587 with an awareness of how morrison tends to devise interactions between physical touch and imagination and how she stages beauty as a surprise effect of mental imagery brought to bear on handiwork we can reread the narrators strange self disclosure at the end of jazz and understand exactly how and why the book takes a body conveying its experience of the hands cupped around it i love the way you hold me how close you let me be to you i like your fingers on and on lifting turning i have watched your face for a long time now and missed your eyes when you went away from me look where your hands are now

810606 maha suci allah yang membawa hamba nya pada malam hari dari masjidil haram di makkah hingga ke masjid aqsa di palestin yang diberkati sekelilingnya untuk memperlihatkan kepadanya tanda tanda kebesaran kami sesungguhnya allah jugalah yang amat mengetahuinya
810607 jadi allah boleh melakukan apa saja yang dia kehendaki perjalanan nabi melalui peristiwa itu juga bukan atas kehendak nabi tetapi dengan kehendak allah swt
810608 dia yang menjalankan dengan kehendak nya maksudnya allah yang menjalankan dengan kehendak allah
810609 malah semua makhluk berjalan dengan kehendak allah misalnya hujan turun dengan kehendak allah perjalanan matahari mengikut peredaran yang tertib juga dengan kehendak allah
810610 perkara ini harus difikirkan secara terbuka iaitu dengan tujuan mahu mencari kebenaran bukannya menutup kebenaran semua kena yakin allah maha berkuasa jika awal awal lagi tidak mahu percaya memang susahlah
810611 tetapi dari segi akal sebenarnya boleh diterima sebab mungkin ia menaiki kapal terbang atau memasuki saku baju penumpang
810612 sebab itu ada ayat dalam al quran yang bermaksud maha suci allah iaitu merujuk kepada kekuasaan allah
810613 supaya allah perlihatkan tanda tanda kebesarannya benda benda zaman dulu tidak boleh lihat tetapi nabi boleh lihat termasuk dengan roh nabi
810614 batu di masjidil aqsa juga terangkat kerana hendak mengikut bersama rasulullah s a w ke langit disebabkan sayang dan tidak hendak berpisah dengan nabi itu adalah tanda kebenaran yang sangat jelas

810723 lawyer regulation and the movement toward a unified bar in kentucky
810724 all persons admitted to the practice of law in this state shall be and they are members of the kentucky bar association upon the completion of the prerequisites under rule 2 100
810725 to conduct a nationwide evaluation of lawyer disciplinary enforcement and to provide a model for responsible regulation of the legal profession into the twenty first century
810726 to strengthen judicial regulation of the profession it must be distinguished from self regulation control of the lawyer discipline system by elected officials of bar associations is self regulation it creates an appearance of conflicts of interest and of impropriety in many states bar officials still investigate prosecute and adjudicate disciplinary cases the state high court should control the disciplinary process exclusively it should appoint disciplinary officials who are independent of the organized bar the states highest court should oversee the customary system with as much care and attention it does to decide cases
810727 all jurisdictions should structure their lawyer disciplinary systems so that disciplinary officials are appointed by the highest court of the jurisdiction or by other disciplinary officials who are appointed by the court disciplinary officials should possess sufficient independent authority to conduct the lawyer discipline function impartially 5 1 elected bar officials their appointees and employees should provide only administrative or other services for the disciplinary system that supports the operation of the system without impairing the independence of disciplinary officials 5 2 elected bar officials their appointees and employees should have no investigative prosecutorial or adjudicative functions in the display process
810728 state and local bar officials provided the impetus for the development of ethical standards and disciplinary mechanisms
810729 one permanent statewide agency to administer the lawyer discipline and disability system
810730 no official of the state bar shall have the right to appoint any persons who perform prosecutorial or adjudicative functions or serve in an ex officio capacity
810731 the disciplinary system should be controlled and managed exclusively by the states highest court and not by state or local bar associations for these compelling reasons first the disciplinary process should be directed solely by the disciplinary policy of the court and its appointees and not influenced by the internal politics of bar associations second the disciplinary system should be free from even the appearance of conflicts of interest or impropriety when elected bar officials control all or parts of the disciplinary process these appearances are created regardless of the actual fairness and impartiality of the system this is true whether the bar is unified or not bar associations can properly manage such programs as mandatory fee arbitration lawyer practice assistance continuing legal education voluntary arbitration and mediation bar operation of these programs does not create a conflict of interest or the appearance of impropriety although some of these programs may interact with the disciplinary process it is entirely appropriate for the organized bar to cooperate with the court in the administration of such programs nothing in these rules should be construed as prohibiting bars from continuing to manage non disciplinary matters nor should these rules be interpreted to support the elimination of unified state bars indeed given the funding requirements of many of these programs bars will be performing a vital public service in fulfilling these functions
810732 shall appoint a bar counsel and such deputy bar counsel as may from time to time be appropriate
810733 the mission and purpose of the association is to maintain a proper discipline of the members of the bar in accordance with these rules and with the principles of the legal profession as a public calling to initiate and supervise with the approval of the court appropriate means to insure sic a continuing high standard of professional competence on the part of the members of the bar and to bear a substantial and continuing responsibility for promoting the efficiency and improvement of the judicial system

810757 a citizen located a black wire kennel in the 600 block of litsey road that contained a black boston terrier with brindle markings
810758 it appears to have been left on the side of the road inside the cage
810759 the roanoke police department is requesting tips from the public on anyone who may have information about this animal
810760 please contact our department at 817 491 6052 or e mail your information to well keep you up to date on this
810761 this girl has been hit by car we think either the leg or pelvis is broken she is small kinda like a giant chihuahua she is terrified and in pain i know everyone is so full but can someone please please make room for her she is so sweet she is out of time
810762 on a sunday afternoon in early december steve and i stopped at my neighborhood petco to pick up a bag of kibbles for my three special kitties of plano was a beautiful 4 or 5 year old calico named theta described on her sign as loving gentle and laid back the very qualities steve had said he wanted in his next cat
810763 i hung back a bit and watched while she charmed her way into his heart and soon heard him ask her if shed like to come home with him
810764 one charming little habit she has is nibbling very lightly on his fingers when she wants him to wake up ok not so charming on a weekend morning when hes trying to sleep in
810765 occasionally she will resort to licking his bald spot very effective as her tongue is like the coarsest grade of sandpaper
810766 only two things seem to bother her laid back disposition a storm will send her under the bed until the noise stops when steves daughter ayla comes to visit with her adorable little bichon mia its back to her safe place again not sure if thats fear or contempt maybe a little of both
810767 any insect flying or crawling foolish enough to enter her territory turns her into a mighty huntress and the bugs life span becomes zero she even eats her prey so steve doesnt have to clean up after her good manners
810768 of course theres no way to know what her history was but we have a theory
810769 thank heaven she was pulled from wherever she was dumped by second chance and can live out her life with love good stuff to eat special play times and great places to nap
810770 there is one more mystery about her well never be able to solve what happened to the other half of her moustache
810771 the girl with the deformed left front foot she has been a shelter favorite because of her awesome disposition
810772 opportunity to continue working in animal welfare on behalf of homeless stray abandoned and abused animals in our community
810773 provide professional pr marketing and development services to animal shelters and humane organizations that have neither the resources nor the expertise to further the cause of animal welfare the purpose of the position is to serve as a voice for the animals promote their humane treatment and increase awareness of animal issues in an effort to save more lives
810774 ill continue to support dallas animal services and of course work to further macs spay neuter programs but assist other groups as well organizations will apply for assistance in the areas of public and media relations marketing cruelty awareness and prevention education fund development and needs assessment ill be able to use my 22 years experience the skills ive learned and the contacts ive made to assist a wide range of animal groups and issues i am very excited about this great opportunity and so grateful to the mitchell family and to mac for making this possible
810775 i sent out a plea asking for help before our rescue has to close down as we are having major financial trouble due to low or no adoptions and boarding costs due to fosters dumping dogs if there is anyway you can post this plea on your site i would really appreciate it we are looking for any donations or fosters who would take in one of our dogs or even rescues that would take in one of our dogs we are getting desperate
810776 our vet bills and our boarding bills are 3 000 and 1 000 right now and they are still adding up we cant afford all of this due to no or low adoptions
810777 if we get enough help we wont have to close if we get the help with donations and fosters we wont have to close
810778 that is reason i am asking for help so we wont have to close
810779 dying for someone to pay attention to him and teach him something he is very smart and eager to please he just has no training he is great with other dogs and people of all ages tank came to us from burns flat okla and was due to be euthanized he had such a great smile and the people there just loved him so we could not turn away
810780 he is built like a sherman tank hence the name
810781 because she is such a good girl she is so sweet and loving loves to share kisses with people and even all the other animals in the pound she has been here a while but with no camera i could not get her posed but here she is in all her glory
810782 i have to have her gone before they open up on monday morning
810783 she noticed a beautiful husky dead on the side of the road
810784 she went back and what she saw broke her heart
810785 animal control pulled up to get the body and said they would take the pup but the woman was scared of what might happen so she took her home
810786 she is not able to keep this sweet baby so we really need someone to help with her asap
810787 he is so sweet and friendly but has chronic arthritis and has difficulty in jumping and walking although he does well on rimadyl
810788 can just a regular person who found a couple of kittens
810789 i found two absolutely adorable 3 month old black kittens and cannot keep them as i already have 10 cats
810790 my friend from the north texas rabbit sanctuary told me about your column and suggested i tell people about the kittens via your website i would love to get these little male kitties a home soon as i dont have enough time for them
810791 i would be very happy to sponsor daddy the caring dog in the collin shelter if there is a rescue group that would be willing to take him any dog that has worked to hard to take care of his fellow creatures deserves a chance to be taken care of
810792 must raise 10 000 to continue saving boxers in need
810793 photographer didnt show up until long after the rally was over so they got only photographs of a few of us who waited
810794 i told everyone in the media the truth that our ccfj rally was a local dfw grass roots citizens effort
810795 it is my hope that the media could see from the make up of the crowd that we were a good representation of the zoos core constituencies we had older people in wheelchairs young kids families and adults of all ages everyone was nicely dressed and well spoken
810796 dallas city council member angela hunts husband came as ms hunt was out of town as you may recall ms hunt is the lone dallas city council person who made the effort to visit the drive thru tourist attraction in mexico and the elephant sanctuary in tennessee and has since supported jenny being transferred to tes voters should remember this in the next election and call her office on monday and thank her
810797 really good turnout at jenny demo all ages and races lots of very senior seniors plus an smu group the only time i remember being this hot was when we were building dog pens down in terrell look for a gray haired red faced old lady with a bright pink umbrella on the evening news clips thats me and im glad i went
810798 we have no leads no suspects we are taking the cage to have it fingerprinted this week if we get a match i will send out a press release
810799 this little lady was released to the shelter by her people who were having trouble getting her to stay in her yard most dogs escape from their yards simply out of boredom bella is hoping to find herself a family where she will be loved and played with enough so she wont want to run away
810800 give us a little attitude like youre an early 1900s musical hall star or maybe somebodys aunt posing for a picture at a family reunion in the summer
810801 i cannot even begin to tell you how great this dog is
810802 she has made a seamless transition into our house and has made fast friends with our other doggies
810803 within 30 minutes she would go to the back door and told us she needed to go out
810804 im sorry they didnt find her but im so glad we did and she wasnt put to sleep
810805 our vets best guess is that she is a year to a year and a half old and shes a lab collie mix
810806 she didnt answer to rosemary or any other name we thought of so we figured it would be ok to change it to praline
810807 so im happy to report this is very much a happy ending story
810808 one of the dogs has been apparently hit by a car little cheyenne is not walking on her rear left leg and she is visibly in pain poor thing she still stayed near me to eat hot dogs out of my hand but she kept having to sit down every couple of minutes due to being unsteady on 3 legs it was heartbreaking driving away knowing she was in pain and that i couldnt bring her home her sister is in foster care and it is hoped that the two sisters can go to a forever home together
810809 we are trying to find tasha a good home with someone that will spend time with her and love her tasha is an american eskimo she is 5 years old weighs between 30 35 pounds and is 2 feet tall
810810 tasha will stay with me until a good home is found for her
810811 she is a very sweet girl and was adopted soon after getting here
810812 she went to her new home on a cattle ranch and was fine for about a week and then decided it was great fun to chase the cows
810813 before she started chasing cows her new owners took her to the vet and discovered she had heartworms and they were going to have her treated however after the cow thing she had to come back to the shelter i have someone that will pay for her hw treatment but she will need a place to recover she will get along with other dogs as long as they are male she is aggressive to females otherwise she would already be at my house
810814 we got between 4 5 inches of snow yesterday lucky had a blast he chased snowballs ran around like an idiot jumped on the trampoline and had a great time with the kids here he is down by the edge of the lake gotta love texas weather
810815 this morning on my way to work i spotted a gorgeous and well cared for
810816 if any of your readers just east of white rock lake have discovered their gorgeous dog missing its strolling northeast last i saw spotted at mockingbird lane and greentree lane at 9 a m
810817 give us a little attitude like youre an early 1900s musical hall star or maybe somebodys aunt posing for a picture at a family reunion in the summer
810818 rosemary is a sweet dog who loves people she gets along well with other dogs and would make an easy addition into any home rosemary was found as a stray who has a micro chip but her chip was not registered so we could not find her owners
810819 she is doing great she loves the attention my kids are giving her she really likes going outside to see what is going on she is really a sweet heart
810820 four pages of notes on meds restrictions and the time table for doctor visits
810821 do volunteer work at operation kindness walking dogs and cuddling the cats
810822 i am so happy to help sadee named on the way to the er by my 14 year ol daughter
810823 fostering was something i have never done before but some with dedes e mail really touched me i offered to help financially and then she responded and wanted to know if i could take her i did not expect that thought about it and then decided we could do it
810824 we drove up to mckinney and sadee still a number at that time was ready for us
810825 after the x rays we found out the leg was shattered and would require a specialist lucky for us they were in the same building and could keep sadee overnight
810826 injury was older and had started to heal so the operation was a little more complicated
810827 used a plate instead of a rod only 150 dogs in the u s have had this done but the vet feels that after about 8 10 weeks of recovery the leg will be as good as new
810828 the momma has some obedience already knows how to sit and down etc
810829 she may be part german shepherd and i dont know what the other half is the lady that has the dogs says her husband will shoot the dogs this is a very urgent matter
810830 sadly a friend let her out this morning and as a man jogged past she bit him
810831 agree to let me get her out of town so that she does not die
810832 was doing what heelers do and she nipped his the joggers heels but she cannot go home
810833 her owner is heart broken over this she spent hours at the pound with her today loving her and telling her how sorry she was this old girl looked at her with such confusion it made me cry
810834 recently someone abandoned a two or three year old female black lab do you know of any rescue groups in this area
810835 i really need to find a place for this pup with a newborn a toddler a new job and now my dad in icu dying i cant do it please someone help this poor fellow thanks for any help at all even if someone could just transport him to the vet and back that would be a big help
810836 got a couple of sweeties that need to be advertised shall we say
810837 they are livestock guard dogs very protective of their families and can be destructive when bored as can happen with any dog
810838 we actually have 5 of the dogs that were picked up in the raid but truman and milli are the ones that we would really like to get forever homes for soon they are both big love bugs
810839 we have nursed him back to health from having had parvo
810840 we are happy to foster him until the right person comes along but we need help getting him out there
810841 i am a mother of 16 adopted pets i worry that they will not be cared for when i die can you recommend a good pet friendly estate attorney so that i can make sure my loved ones are cared for in the event of my death
810842 it is very sweet to watch spca said they would take the other 3 but he has no one a pits fate in the shelter is grim
810843 a black and white cat showed up on my front porch one day a couple of weeks ago and she was very tame and let me hold her but had no collar
810844 after a couple of weeks i noticed her getting very round in the middle sort of like some of us as we age ha ha and knew she must be pregnant and i could not let her have those babies in this texas heat
810845 anyway flo as i called her gave birth on friday night with me as the midwife and she did very well except i had to cut the cords on all the kittens which was frightening to me but she didnt seem to know it had to be done
810846 they all look like little dalmatians except one who is all black with white socks
810847 midway hollow area northwest highway walnut hill and midway to marsh he is adorable isnt he looks like a big ol sweetie
810848 we found a lost dog that we would like you to email out or see if anyone would want him
810849 we took him to the vet midway hollow clinic yesterday monday to check for a microchip none found we also got all of his shots
810850 every minute counts with beagles he could be in china by now we wont stop trying though
810851 we had someone lined up to adopt gus from dallas
810852 i called to verify everything and the animal control driver said that someone adopted him two hours earlier he said it was the niece of the original owner and they had a farm they were taking him to i am so relieved that he finally has a home again lets hope and pray they take care of him
810853 there are lots more sweet dogs in situations like gus so hopefully we all can continue the effort and remember that there are a lot of us and we are not alone in this seemingly endless battle to help the helpless
810854 after trying my best to rehabilitate this rescue dog for nearly two years now taking him to training classes faithfully giving him money for his insurmountable remote control cell phone carpet padding habits and driving him to doggie day care three times a week i think im going to have to admit that ive just plain failed somewhere in the raising of this dog i have gone wrong
810855 colonel dog was only 6 months old when i picked him up but the shelter assured me that having already attained the prestigious rank of colonel at such a tender age he was past the point in his career when he might himself be called up for duty that in combination with his adorably pathetic adoption photo left made him an easy sell
810856 you have a thing for big eared doggies well i thought i would forward this picture on to you
810857 dont try to whisper around me because these babies can pick up the slightest sound
810858 they are brothers and came to us as babies and have been with us for over a year now
810859 chinchin is the gray and white chinchilla colored rabbit and booboo is the white rabbit with gray ears and gray nose
810860 they are just cute bunny rabbits no special breed but those are usually the best ones in my opinion the bunny mixes they are pretty shy but with care and attention they will come out of their shyness
810861 recently won a 500 grand from leith petwerks thanks to our members leith petwerks makes fabulous bunny condos i have a few of their 3 story ones for my rabbits and i just love them
810862 i have six 8 week old babies here at my house i am really not in a position to have them here but i had no choice i have received several calls about this very skinny chocolate lab and her babies the babies are always out in the street and wandering
810863 they about fell into the bowls they were so hungry
810864 i know who owns them we have actually gotten several dogs from her in the past none of them cared for so i need help and i need it fast i have nowhere to put these innocent young lives
810865 he was wearing a collar but had no tags and no microchip
810866 what i find most peculiar is that this not your garden variety stray
810867 if we dont find an owner soon we will start to look for a new home for him hes on the hyper side and can be jumpy but hes very smart and has strong herding instincts he wants to chase cars and if i dont go where he wants he jumps and nips at my elbow he probably needs an experienced dog owner someone willing to help calm him down properly train him and give him something to do he loves chasing a ball so he might be a good candidate for flyball or agility to run off all his energy he is very affectionate and after 3 days is already comfortable with me and my husband
810868 a good day to think about snow way too hot up here lucky went out on a pontoon boat yesterday with us and rode around while the kids rode on the tube he stood up front with his ears flapping in the wind part of the time but the constant turning and moving made him sick poor baby and poor mom having to clean it up he is used to going fishing with ed my husband and sitting in one spot for hours lol not moving around a lot because you know after 1 1 2 hours they will bite any minute so you cant move
810869 lucky im ready for winter again the weimaraner smidge im looking for trouble as usual the siamese mix and june bug im trying to stay away from smidge the tortie mix
810870 quite troubling are people really that ignorant about rescue work
810871 if these dogs are suppose to be rescue pets then why do you charge so much just for a re homing fee i think its pretty ridiculous maybe you should start really thinking about the pets and not just what you profit from it its about the pets not the money
810872 what profit please let people know how rescue works and the expenses involved
810873 we have 20 dogs currently available for adoption and two un adoptable dogs one has a brain tumor and the other is a fear biter we just recently had one come to us anemic with a broken leg broken tail and open sores all over her body we even had to remove some tar like substance from her ears not to mention the million fleas
810874 i currently have 12 foster dogs in my care alone i dont live on a ranch and they dont get put in kennels at least 6 of them sleep in my bed each night we really could use some foster mommies or daddies too we have four dogs in boarding because we dont have foster homes for them to go to
810875 that would pay for a lot of spaying and neutering
810876 two smart sweet sisters abandoned at white rock a month ago
810877 i live in a small townhouse with an old weird cat that wouldnt tolerate or survive them
810878 a different breed has been able to find fosters for many of sherrys requests including 8 kittens earlier this week but now our foster homes are full and our wallets are empty several of our adb dogs have had to have surgery and or heartworm treatment and we just dont have funds to pay for additional veterinary treatment or boarding
810879 he was hot and tired so i took him in gave him some water let him rest then fed him
810880 hes the next door neighbor of a lady who works in my building and she has a dog who could be calis twin and the two dogs will be able to play anytime and he has a farm that she can run free on too
810881 faas was created to support aas much like the friends of the library helps the library with items that the city has no budget for like dog and cat beds and toys as well as programs like training seminars and possibly an injured stray animal fund we just got started it took the original members 12 of us pitching in our own money to cover the cost of securing 501 c 3 status so we are hoping this little garage sale starts the ball rolling one of our members mom works for washington mutual they have agreed to match us dollar for dollar on any money we make
810882 the dogs were going to be euthanized when they were pups because they had parvo he took them home and got them over the virus and they are doing very well now
810883 but the person taking the pictures assured me that they were very friendly just a little frightened by some stranger coming up to their fence
810884 he is a beagle mix he looks just like a beagle just larger
810885 he was one of the first dogs placed with oklahoma beagle rescue so we have no way of tracking him he was dog number 6 we are currently over 250
810886 she is a 4 month old pit mix sweet as ever
810887 she got sick the very next day we found her she tested positive to parvo thanks again to paws in the city she was treated at east dallas veterinary clinic she is gonna be ok with donations from little forest hills residents she will be boarded at east dallas for two weeks after that she is ready for a new home if there is someone out there that wants to foster her that would be a big help or maybe someone that wants her for good

810897 soon to be sara hartshorn as soon as i have time to file the marriage paperwork you ran a story on your website back on 6 20 about our stolen yorkie kona
810898 it has been extremely difficult to settle back into normal life here as things are just not the same without kona a member of our family
810899 we are even having to uproot the life we had in dallas to find somewhere new to live
810900 unfortunately even with the overwhelming response we have received to the public awareness campaign and the numerous offers for assistance we still have not found him
810901 we would greatly appreciate it if you could post another little reminder that kona is still missing
810902 a basic description is kona a small black and brown male yorkshire terrier weighing about 7 lbs
810903 because because she took more time to heal lo and behold shes a stray not a feral and has really been picked on by other cats but shes responding beautifully to humans
810904 i dropped and broke the screen on my digital camera it is a bad thing for without the pictures i dont know if the dogs will move i learned very early in this that pictures are a must i will try to describe the dogs as good as i can but for a while i cannot send pictures
810905 if scott hadnt seen him he would have been coyote bait or a grease spot on the road he is so darling but they cannot keep him they are moving to houston next month with 3 dogs 2 cats and 2 horses all rescues of course
810906 she is heartworm positive roundworms and hookworms too and malnourished and also very cowed
810907 the vets thought this little girl would have a hard time carrying and delivering all these babies so we agreed that the best course of action for her was to have her spayed
810908 she had been called mamma mia but now theyre just calling her mia and
810909 if anyone wants to help with her spay and heartworm treatment they can donate directly via charge to our wonderful vets metro paws at 214 887 1400 but rest assured that she is safe and will soon be happy in her foster home and after her heartworm treatment will find a wonderful permanent home where she will be loved and cared for just as she should have been all along

811039 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
811040 i dont think the next president will do that no matter who he is
811041 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
811042 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
811043 pardon any official from cabinet secretary on down who might plausibly face prosecution
811044 a lot of people think that that is not something that goes over well with the american people
811045 what we have much more of a tradition of is presidential fact finding commissions
811046 something like this would be unprecedented in the american experience and i think it would be absolutely necessary
811047 presidential commissions and national security the politics of damage control
811048 weve had panels that have looked at scandals weve had panels that have looked at intractable political problems
811049 but nothing in terms of looking at an issue that has this array of legal moral and even spiritual questions attached to it
811050 ill just cut up my credit cards once i pay them off and then ill sock away plenty of money for the even greater depression well be a family of scrappy but satisfied bean eaters our neighbors with their updated kitchens and their enormous home equity lines and their brand new cars may gawk at us now planting tomatoes and splashing our feet in the baby pool instead of going to the movies or shopping at the mall but soon theyll be packing their stainless steel appliances into their covered wagons and heading east to look for work while i smugly stand here doing dishes in the 100 degree heat of my un air conditioned los angeles home and feeling proud that all of our penny pinching finally paid off
811051 to retire with an inflation adjusted retirement income of 50 000 for 20 years would require 3 075 744 65 in savings by the time you retired at 65 you need to save an additional 47 613 58 each year to reach your retirement goal

811057 one of the guys who started the baghdad country club went on to open a liquor store and then a restaurant but then he had to close the place the people who worked for him didnt have the right badges
811058 theyre not in the clean clothes basket they are not in the dirty clothes basket
811059 theyre absent from the bedroom floor absent from the bathroom floor i just cleaned the living room so i know theyre not there
811060 adding a fee to it i think thats kind of ridiculous
811061 you or your company youre traveling for business or pleasure trying to build these miles up to put them toward something why get charged for it when it should be free
811062 but i think people really understand that the price of fuel is so high that the airline has to do something to compensate
811063 generally as ticket prices have increased i think people have been more willing to part with their miles
811064 i got away using my points when prices were rising
811065 so i had my flight in hand when people were paying higher prices
811066 but given the circumstances we certainly do want these remaining airlines to stay in business
811067 schedules and flights are going to be cut way back it will be interesting to see just what these cuts in the fall will mean for redemption
811068 we have to make sure the customers see value in the miles
811069 so for that reason we have to make sure that weve got sufficient inventory all the time out there we would never dramatically reduce the amount of inventory thats available to the customers
811070 the difficulty is always there is never enough inventory in the places people really want to go
811071 theres never enough tickets to ft myers to go see the twins in spring training
811072 the important thing for the fed right now is to skate through this delicate period
811073 another way for banks to manipulate account holders balances to spur more overdraft fees
811074 consumers are already shell shocked by higher prices but their wallets are going to be hit harder than ever before on their next vacation or business trip
811075 with rising airfares ive had to take a completely different approach to my leisure travel
811076 theres a lot more time invested in researching better fares looking at alternate airports and determining any potential savings from driving to an airport that may not necessarily be closest to home
811077 has initiated or participated in over 30 domestic fare and surcharge increases
811078 while travelers are no doubt feeling pinched especially in light of rising food and gasoline prices it is difficult to blame airlines for raising prices in order to cover costs that are by and large beyond their control
811079 we have had cheap flights and now it is time to pay the bill
811080 theyre starting to look at destinations like buenos aires where you can have a relatively european experience and the dollar goes further

811090 as an artist yourself we hope that you regognize the need to respect other artists rights and louis vuittons intellectual property rights which include the louis vuitton monogram multicolore trademark
811091 however i must inform you that the bag in my drawing is inspired by and refers to designers bags in general not a louis vuitton bag if you take a closer look you will also notice that the pattern in my drawing is not the pattern which is used in the design of a loius vuitton bag the name louis vuitton is in no way mentioned or referred to neither in my drawing nor in the campaign as such

811098 it appears the mccain people are so frustrated with obamas star appeal and their sense that he is harder to criticize that theyve made the judgment they have to somehow tarnish him rough him up so that he doesnt look so great even at the risk of making mccain himself look not so great
811099 i dont think its very pretty i hope it doesnt work but i think theyve made a professional judgment that in order to win this is what they have to do

811370 i went and grabbed a water hose and started spraying water on the house and on the roof because i knew it was going to burn all the way through
811371 initially they were struggling with one of the fire hydrants which is our primary water supply
811372 we had to take a secondary water supply and also requested three water tenders immediately when we started having trouble
811373 fortunately both homes were saved in the fire fight and only the garages were lost
811374 but the wind was probably our biggest factor pushing the fire from structure to structure and getting enough firefighters in here to fight it and enough water to get it cooled down to where it wouldnt spread to the houses
811375 that yardarm burned through before the power company could come and turn the power off
811376 my concern was that we were going to have additional fires from the arcing that occurred when that power line dropped and in fact we had quite a bit of arcing but fortunately no additional fires started

811461 in a lot of organizations the willingness to serve gets smothered because people are no longer passionate about what they do cumbersome systems bosses who are too controlling boring routine and endless competition exhaust people and cause them to feel indignant or indifferent when customers bump into exhausted indignant indifferent employees disgruntlement is what they see its hard to feel passionate when you dont feel supported
811462 what is it that is expected of me that i am not being told
811463 leadership isnt some sophisticated technique for getting people to do what you want them to do leadership is getting people to want to do what you want them to do because they share your purpose vision and values when the interests of leaders and collaborators overlap the result is long term sustained commitment when people are committed they are bound emotionally or intellectually to a purpose or course of action they are in it with all their heart soul and mind compliant people simply go through the motions and put in their time its difficult for them to transcend the nine to five mentality because they have no emotional or spiritual attachment to the cause their work represents commitment doesnt come with position and it cant be bought commitment must be earned leaders and collaborators are drawn to higher levels of commitment when both see that their personal agendas are encompassed by a purpose that is deeply held by everyone in the relationship
811464 just as climbers need a mountain peak to get their juices going or a surgeon needs a health emergency to get involved workers need a compelling reason to focus their energies on the job
811465 people want to work for a cause not just for a living
811466 people who are good at what they do enjoy the process of the work itself the process of doing the work sets up a pleasant concentration of attention and energy that creates a kind of flow attaining that state of mind as an individual or in a team is works most effective reward the point of management is ultimately to bring about conditions that permit that sort of work to happen while pursuing the organizations mission
811467 a job that employs only a fraction of ones skills quickly becomes a burden one feels that most of ones potential is left unused wasted consider the clerk at the department of transportation whose job it is to pass out forms to endless lines of applicants for a drivers license and then quickly check each form for completeness how much of her being is involved in this task when most of ones skills remain unengaged involvement in the job soon falters and it is not surprising that one begins to yearn for free time where there is a chance to be fully alive
811468 a new leadership is needed for new times but it will not come from finding new and more wily ways to manipulate the external world it will come as we who lead find the courage to take an inner journey toward both our shadows and our light a journey that faithfully pursued will take us beyond ourselves to become healers of a wounded world
811469 many of these works would be more appropriately designated as

811472 we believe that practices that best typify meaningfulness in working are those that nurture callings when ones work is a calling it is seen as socially valuable an end in itself involving activities that may but need not be pleasurable callings have also been associated with expressing ones authentic self in what one does when you answer your calling you become the person that only you can be as such callings involve role identity and meaningfulness
811473 we argue that organizations that foster transcendence provide strong linkages between who we are what we do and why we are here in this context while simultaneously connecting workers to something greater than themselves their tasks or perhaps even the organization for which they work
811474 in exchange for plastic perfection and a longer shelf life bioengineering often leaves us with produce drained of the juiciness sweetness and goodness we are in danger of producing a product that is less than wonderfully and happily human

811481 the values that determine the quality of organizational life are not those of cohesive work groups attempting to provide excellent products for services but those of bottom line management in an entity that is desperate for cash flow
811482 workers are conceding their time they are working longer hours they are taking work home often continuing after hours on computer equipment that they have purchased themselves they are devoting more time to tasks that are not personally rewarding that is they are not enjoyable and do not further their careers they are giving up long cherished benefits like fully paid health insurance and company financed pension plans
811483 the restrictions also affect these individuals sense of efficacy because they diminish their capacity to continue what occurs in their work people in organizations feel more constrained in practice problems are delegated but the power to address them is not

811485 expectancy theory argues that people are mostly rational decision makers who think about their actions and act in ways that satisfy their needs and help them to reach their goals the core of the theory states that people generally try to deal rationally with the world as they see it and to direct their behavior in productive ways the theory views people as proactive future oriented and motivated to behave in ways that they believe will lead to valued rewards
811486 work not for financial rewards or for advancement but for the fulfillment that doing the work brings in callings the work is an end in itself and is associated with the belief that the work makes the world a better place
811487 nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest without passions without business without diversion without effort then he feels his nothingness his forlornness his insufficiency his weakness his emptiness
811488 some persons indeed try to abdicate their life disown their spontaneity seek security by conforming to what is outside of them but they dont actually escape life or their responsibility for it they only succeed in appearing wooden unlively we may know what to expect from them but we have as little delight in them as they do in themselves

811503 barack obama contradicts and threatens everything i believe about the institution of the family and what is best for the nation his radical positions on life marriage and national security force me to reevaluate the candidacy of our only other choice john mccain
811504 the candidate downplays the possibilities but an election victory would change the shape of a movement
811505 but how large a role the commemoration of the anniversary should play and how much it becomes the conventions main theme is a decision that sen obama might be wise to think about long and hard at stake could the votes of millions of white middle class voters who polls show remain skeptical about him it could be much more significant than his much discussed decision to move his speech from the convention hall to denvers football stadium to accommodate a larger crowd

811583 ive always felt pawtucket is in my opinion the best hitting team in the league
811584 he went out and did what we needed him to do obviously and what he probably needed to do himself it was a quality start
811585 they sent him down to work on some things and hes been working with chavy pitching coach rafael chaves
811586 early in the year when he was with new york i didnt have my changeup now its just ironing some things out mechanically and going after hitters a little more
811587 mechanics wise chavy and i have worked on a lot of little things in my last four starts im really seeing it a lot
811588 it actually was kind of good i got to clear my head a little bit andy pettitte always says get your mind right i got my mind right and focused on the right things and its working out so far

811601 playing the outside corner its you and a receiver there is nobody outside of you in nickel youre inside and everybody is around you so its a whole lot more going on you have a lot more reads its definitely more mentally challenging if youre inside
811602 you get to blitz more you get a lot more opportunities to make plays but wherever they need me whether its inside outside im willing to play
811603 i came from tampa bay and i saw ronde barber play nickel for two years ronde barber is one of the best nickels if not the best but antoine is right there with him

811629 miami dade county needs more affordable housing for certain residents the uneven geographic distribution of housing affordable to these residents as well as the distance between jobs and available housing also increase traffic congestion and decrease economic productivity traffic and roadway congestion in turn adversely affect the environment and diminish air quality increasing the burden on the public health care system and resulting in rising health care costs the public health safety and welfare of the present and future residents of miami dade county can best be protected by ensuring that land use policies avoid the elimination of affordable housing including mobile home parks residents of mobile home parks are at risk of being detrimentally affected by the elimination of mobile home parks through redevelopment

811637 this week has made it crystal clear that the only ones doing well in the bush mccain economy are oil company executives
811638 as we pay more than ever to fill our tanks and to heat and cool our homes exxon bp shell and chevron all announced billions in new profits including the highest single quarter take in history meanwhile american jobs continue to disappear millions have seen their full time jobs cut to part time work and unemployment has reached a four year high it is disturbing that none of this news seems to concern bush mccain republicans while employers have cut jobs for seven straight months republicans have blocked at least seven of our efforts this year to create good paying jobs here at home by investing in alternative renewable energy sources
811639 with the price of food and fuel skyrocketing americans and latinos in particular are being squeezed at the pump and the supermarket as they bear the burden of a struggling economy
811640 once again the latino unemployment rate is higher than that of the rest of the population while oil company profits are higher than theyve ever been in history democrats have a plan to lower gas prices break our dependence on oil stop federal handouts to oil companies and ultimately create jobs but republicans are fighting vigorously to aid and protect the oil companies when its the american people and hardworking latinos who need us to fight for them oil companies have had almost eight years of an administration thats held their hand its time for a government that holds them accountable
811641 democrats know america cannot afford for this streak to continue any longer which is why we will continue working to strengthen our economy in the short term and address the long term economic problems hurting americas middle class we will propose new legislation to jumpstart our economy and continue our effort to invest in clean energy both of which will create good paying jobs here in america we hope that bush mccain republicans will finally do more than offer the same failed fiscal and foreign policy strategies that got us into this mess in the first place

811733 there are still many unanswered questions regarding prues disappearance mr clark said
811734 she had no criminal history nor did she have any known personal reasons to run away from home she left a hot meal uneaten on the table and did not take any possessions with her
811735 it is as though she simply disappeared off the face of the earth

811740 if you want to save yourself countless hours of endlessly searching the internet and staring at your computer monitor then i encourage you to get a copy of the manifesto youll find that practically every major new world order institution event and philosophy is explained in detail so that anyone with a desire to know the truth will be able to see it crystal clear
811741 i own most of the old esoteric books that you sometimes hear people talk about when discussing the new world order and the illuminati i have studied them for years and in the manifesto i show that its not just me making claims about what the illuminati is and what their plans are but i clearly show you that illuminati authors have clearly written out their plans in books that are obscure yet available to the public
811742 it is my sincere hope that people who read the book will come to a better understanding of their purpose in this world and come into a harmonious relationship with devine creator of the universe and stand up for liberty and justice for others

811750 were by nature children of wrath like the rest of mankind
811751 therefore since we have been justified counted righteous by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
811752 since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of god
811753 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in jesus christ so we also have believed in christ jesus in order to be justified by faith in christ and not by works of the law because by works of the law no one will be justified

812003 many people find it difficult to believe that methuselah lived to be 969 years old nevertheless the bible teaches quite plainly that the early patriarchs often lived to be nearly 1 000 years old and even had children when they were several hundred years old similar claims of long life spans are found in the secular literature of several ancient cultures including the babylonians greeks romans indians and chinese but even a life span of nearly 1 000 years is sadly abbreviated when we consider that god initially created us to live forever

812008 why dont labels adapt to the changing nature of distribution by selling new albums online as soon as theyre finished before they have a chance to leak and release the physical cds a couple months later
812009 if you sell britney spears album online before we can sell it in our stores we lose money so if you do that were not going to stock her album at all and then youll lose a lot of money
812010 the greatest marketing tool ever to come along for the music industry
812011 we understand that these are just music fans trying to listen to as much music as they can but we have to protect our assets and were working on an industry wide solution to accommodate the changing needs of music fans
812012 this was not a case of friends sharing music for pleasure
812013 if we didnt believe that when people hear the music they will want to buy the cd then we wouldnt do what we are doing
812014 it was a job i got payed i dont care what happens to the product
812015 once people realize that they dont need cds anymore the floodgates are going to pore open maybe we should embrace this
812016 why shouldnt i be able to listen to all this music why have cds been around for over 20 years and not gone significantly down in price
812017 we have extremely strong brands in asia thanks to the pirates they have created millions of consumers not customers
812018 we now have to learn the business of running an online community
812019 you really think its itunes 99 cents per song for less than cd quality no physical copy and copyright restrictions resulting in tens of thousands of dollars to fill up an ipod
812020 do you really think record companies should own the art that musicians create
812021 finding out that our album had been leaked online was one of the most emotionally painful experiences ive ever been through it was like watching someone fuck my wife i punched the guy in the face who told me it happened i mean it took us two fucking years and over 100 000 to record the album without a record label we had to take out a bank loan to pay for it to put all that time effort and money into recording an album only to have it come out in this shitty sounding mp3 format without any artwork was extremely upsetting
812022 im now fans of their music and i may not have bought their cds but i would have never bought their cd anyway because i would have never heard of them

812024 why a subscription model for downloading music is brought up at no point in steve jobss open letter to the music industry is beyond me paying a monthly subscription works for cable tv for magazines for movies netflix people do not mind paying a fee for access to their entertainment and claiming otherwise is ignorant
812025 sscilli taking music you legally purchased on cd and ripping it to your pc mac or ipod mp3 player is perfectly legal
812026 musicians deserve to live off their art too and you thinking music should be free in order to take music back is as stupid as stupid could be
812027 i would if i knew how at this point i dont mind if people download my music because that means that theres a person who wants to listen i give away cds at shows if someone wants a cd but doesnt have any money i wouldnt want to do that forever i would happy for someone to download my music
812028 major labels offer exposure and a massive promotional machine that an artist going it alone or on a small indie label could never strike up on their own
812029 you think radiohead could have taken this incredible non label dive without having a major break them to the public in the first place do you think nin would be famous had there not been a major label machine helping to bring his art to the masses
812030 how do you pay your bills by making art do you make art for free i didnt think so
812031 to be fair you can imagine how confusing this must have been for them is there even a historical precedent for an industrys products suddenly being able to replicate and distribute on their own without cost
812032 i never heard of oink before but now i wish i could have been on it
812033 you believe copyright laws no longer reflect the interests of the people
812034 in a perfect world i would like to see musicians doing what they love and not having to work multiple jobs to make their ends meet
812035 there are always meaningful songs for somebody people are doing their courting people are finding wives people are making babies people are washing the dishes people are getting through the day with songs we may deem insignificant but their significance is affirmed by others thats what dignifies the song songs dont dignify human activity human activity dignifies the song
812036 we are at a pivotal moment in american democracy the persistent and sustained reliance on falsehoods as the basis of policy even in the face of evidence to the contrary has reached levels that were previously unimaginable its too easy and too partisan to simply place the blame on the policies of president george w bush we are all responsible for the decisions our country makes reasoned focused discourse is vital to our democracy to ensure a well informed citizenry but this is difficult in an environment in which we are experiencing a new pattern of serial obsessions that periodically take over the airwaves for weeks at a time from the o j simpson and michael jackson trials to paris hilton and anna nicole smith

812113 im really happy stewart said after following carl edwards across the finish line
812114 it seemed like our car was an eighth to 10th place car the majority of the day stewart said
812115 after the red it seemed like our car came into it a lot more the longer we went there we finally got running with the guys that ran up front all day
812116 that was a great feeling to be doing that again when you get in a slump like weve been in this year when you have had nine years of success its easy to take it for granted days like today remind you how much you appreciate having a good day
812117 i can promise you that we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were done to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me
812118 we just got mired in traffic there at the beginning of the race harvick said

812132 when corals die off so do the other plants and animals that depend on coral reefs for food and shelter and this can lead to the collapse of entire ecosystems
812133 these results show that as a group reef building corals are more at risk of extinction than all terrestrial groups apart from amphibians and are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change
812134 the loss of the corals will have profound implications for millions of people who depend on coral reefs for their livelihoods
812135 we either reduce our co 2 emission now or many corals will be lost forever
812136 improving water quality global education and the adequate funding of local conservation practices also are essential to protect the foundation of beautiful and valuable coral reef ecosystems
812137 at massport we are continually striving to improve our facilities making them more energy efficient as well as environmentally and user friendly

812145 the solar power laboratory will further build up the universitys already formidable solar energy research and develop collaborations with the energy industry to accelerate expansion of the states economy
812146 our goal is for asu to have the pre eminent academic solar energy research development and training program in the united states and one of the top such programs in the world
812147 the establishment of the solar power laboratory and the hiring of honsberg bowden and maracas combined with our ongoing research efforts help us meet this objective
812148 asu and the state of arizona have a number of exciting economic development and research opportunities associated with renewable energy
812149 these three new faculty members will play key roles in making sure that these efforts are successful
812150 we hope to unify the various solar energy related research efforts throughout the university and to develop industry collaborations
812151 will bring together other asu researchers from materials engineering physics chemistry electrical engineering and architecture
812152 for four decades asu has been a leader in research related to virtually all aspects of solar energy
812153 to build on these accomplishments and more importantly increase the chances for arizona to attract more international solar companies we decided asu needed to bring in new faculty members who have outstanding reputations in the global solar industry
812154 are well known to the solar industry on both sides of the pacific
812155 in a technical community replete with creative engineers and scientists christiana honsberg stands out as a talent of unique vision
812156 has turned to honsberg to lead its most ambitious investigations of high efficiency photovoltaics
812157 she will be a great addition to asus growing franchise in solar research
812158 clearly among world leaders in their respective fields in photovoltaics their strong links to the university of new south wales and suntech will provide great opportunities for research and development collaboration with asu
812159 ok youve bought your new laptop now what do with that old clunker of a desktop the green thing to do would be to recycle it right were pretty conditioned to consider that option since we do it for plastic bottles and aluminum cans so
812160 the led technology has the potential of replacing all incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs which would have dramatic energy and environmental ramifications
812161 when the led emits light some of it goes down and some goes up and we want the light that goes down to bounce back up so we dont lose it
812162 one of the main achievements in this work was placing a barrier on the silicon substrate to keep the zirconium nitride from reacting
812163 we call this epitaxial growth or the ordered arrangement of atoms on top of the substrate
812164 the atoms travel to the substrate and they move around on the silicon until they find the right spot
812165 it all starts with silicon which is a single crystal and you end up with gallium nitride thats oriented with respect to the silicon through these intermediate layers of zirconium nitride and aluminum nitride
812166 if you just deposited gallium nitride on a glass slide for example you wouldnt get the ordered crystalline structure and the led would not operate efficiently
812167 if you replaced existing lighting with solid state lighting following some reasonable estimates for the penetration of that technology based on economics and other factors it could reduce the amount of energy we consume for lighting by about one third
812168 that represents a 10 percent reduction of electricity consumption and a comparable reduction of related carbon emissions
812169 when the cost of a white led lamp comes down to about 5 leds will be in widespread use for general illumination
812170 leds are still improving in efficiency so they will surpass fluorescents everything looks favorable for leds except for that initial cost a problem that is likely to be solved soon
812171 the silicon wafer expands and contracts less than the gallium nitride
812172 when you cool it down the silicon does not contract as fast as the gallium nitride and the gallium nitride tends to crack
812173 the major obstacle was coming up with a substrate based on silicon that also has a reflective surface underneath the epitaxial gallium nitride layer and we have now solved this problem

812176 we think this is a practical technology for reducing the cost of solar power
812177 solar cells generate at least ten times more power when attached to the concentrator

812190 light is collected over a large area like a window and gathered or concentrated at the edges
812191 professor baldos project utilizes innovative design to achieve superior solar conversion without optical tracking
812192 this accomplishment demonstrates the critical importance of innovative basic research in bringing about revolutionary advances in solar energy utilization in a cost effective manner
812193 track the sun to generate high optical intensities often by using large mobile mirrors that are expensive to deploy and maintain
812194 solar cells at the focal point of the mirrors must be cooled and the entire assembly wastes space around the perimeter to avoid shadowing neighboring concentrators
812195 we made it so the light can travel a much longer distance
812196 we were able to substantially reduce light transport losses resulting in a tenfold increase in the amount of power converted by the solar cells
812197 this is an incredible moment in the history of the bahrain world trade center we are extremely proud to be the first in the world to integrate wind turbines into a commercial development to create an alternative source of energy what we have achieved here in bahrain demonstrates to the world how we are actively playing our part in addressing the global issue of climate change
812198 the bwtc towers have already become an iconic feature of the manama skyline and are increasingly raising bahrains profile not only in the gcc region but also across the world the bwtc will attract leading regional and international organisations with a world class business destination which will have a positive impact on tourism commerce and numerous other financial benefits for the kingdom
812199 from the outset i had a clear vision of integrating renewable energy into the design of the bwtc
812200 the bwtc project sets a technological precedent which we hope raises the awareness of environmental design and its importance in the built environment
812201 this project has given us great optimism for the future because we have clearly demonstrated that we can create a commercial development which is underpinned by an environmental agenda
812202 electricity demand for industrial and home cooling increases near linearly with temperature
812203 in the future widespread climate warming across the western u s could further strain the electricity grid making brownouts or even rolling blackouts more frequent

812212 we had the upper hand seven innings of the game
812213 we didnt do a very good job of finishing the game from an offensive standpoint we scored the first two innings and didnt score again we have to keep the pressure on and put another run on the board
812214 im not expected to get a hit or do anything productive with the bat so youve got to get me out of there in that situation
812215 in a two run game youve got to get me out of there

812221 the scientific and technological advances enabled by the information that we generate from these selections promise to take us faster and further down the path toward clean renewable transportation fuels while affording us a more comprehensive understanding of the global carbon cycle
812222 the range of projects spans important terrestrial contributors to biomass production in the loblolly pine the cornerstone of the u s forest products industry to phytoplankton barely visible to the naked eye but no less important to the massive generation of fixed carbon in our marine ecosystems
812223 its ability to efficiently convert co2 into biomass and its widespread use as a plantation tree have also made loblolly a cost effective feedstock for cellulosic biofuel production and a promising tool in efforts to curb greenhouse gas levels through carbon sequestration
812224 these plants produce biomass faster than any other flowering plant and their carbohydrate content is readily converted to fermentable sugars by using commercially available enzymes developed for corn based ethanol production
812225 moreover duckweed relates to all three of doe jgis mission areas bioenergy bioremediation and global carbon cycling
812226 loan guarantees from the department will enable project developers to bridge the financing gap between pilot and demonstration projects to full commercially viable projects that employ new or significantly improved energy technologies
812227 projects supported by loan guarantees will help meet president bushs goal of diversifying our nations energy mix with energy projects that will improve the environment while increasing energy efficiency

812232 shes been waiting for this for four years so that was huge
812233 im usually not nervous but i think i will be in the olympics
812234 i just have so much confidence and see how hard she trains and how well she takes care of her body i just think shes ready for this situation
812235 i feel 10 times more comfortable than i was last year at this time
812236 because i know the defense so much better ive been focusing a lot more on my technique rather than learning plays
812237 last year was a big learning experience for me i was more mentally exhausted than physically so it really took a toll on me this year i can tell a big difference im happy to go to meetings im happy to get out there and practice work new techniques and im feeling 10 times better than last year
812238 we have ichat so im able to see her as well
812239 thats my lady she always keeps an eye on me so im going to try and support her 100

812241 we keep tabs on each other she knows im out here at work so she knows what time to call me
812242 she trains in waco every monday and tuesday i usually go with her and every wednesday thursday and friday she is home in austin so were there and saturday when she is running im there
812243 so in 09 around february shes going to do a lot of the planning then my season and her season are coming up so we are going to wait until right after football season and in february 2010 were going to tie the knot
812244 gold medal is individual so thats big all eyes will be on her
812245 i feel that if im able to play in the cleveland game and playing in three preseason games with still another two weeks of camp then i feel i have enough time to prepare for the season
812246 but everyone i talked to was saying my knee got into shape from playing last season but once i took time off after the season the ligaments and everything weakened and stretched out then when i got back it wasnt in shape
812247 its a very tricky injury i dont know what to expect from it because of the way it acted up after the season i really dont know what to expect from what the doctor said that is why they held me out of training camp so far they didnt want me to hurt it again as soon as i got here
812248 i dont think im going to ever have children i just couldnt bring a child into a world like this one
812249 been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding

812255 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
812256 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
812257 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
812258 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
812259 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
812260 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
812261 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
812262 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
812263 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
812264 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
812265 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
812266 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
812267 we knew arizona had picked up on something but when we looked at our video we werent seeing it we realized later it was because he was tipping in the early part of his windup and our guys were only filming his delivery we changed the way we did our video after that

812270 the court crafted an opinion that protects both tribal sovereignty and individual indian rights
812271 this decision is a strong affirmation for tribes across the country who rely upon federal courts to uphold tribal sovereignty when it comes under attack

812293 incorporating path dependence into decision analytical methods an application to global climate change policy
812294 a large scale international policy issue such as climate change is especially vulnerable to path dependencies if significant global emissions reductions are required in the long run this will be an extremely difficult problem to coordinate across nations
812295 the question posed in this study is does accounting for path dependency in political systems change the first period today optimal choice from a sequential decision model of climate policy
812296 if it does then this would argue for a more aggressive hedging strategy with greater emissions reductions for near term climate policy this action would allow for greater flexibility if significant reductions are required later in the century
812297 participants commented that they became much more aware of their energy consumption and environmental impact by taking part in the year long study and were as a result motivated to make changes to their behavior and physical surroundings
812298 the major obstacles to reducing environmental impact were seen as financial cost and lack of time and knowledge to evaluate and implement environmental measures
812299 these lifestyle factors appeared to have more impact than the environmental features we think of most often like the quality of the building envelope or energy efficiency of appliances and fixtures

812319 the negative choice is for the regime to maintain its current course if the regime does so it will incur only great costs
812320 as soon as iran fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities the united states will come to the table with our eu 3 colleagues and meet with irans representatives
812321 you have to understand that with this regime when they hear about human rights when they hear about democracy when they hear about womens rights everything like that to them is like cyanide
812322 in my opinion the only thing that will force the regime to change its behaviour is not any carrot youre dangling from the outside or any threat to strike them with weapons to neutralize their military capabilities the biggest fear over which the leaders lose sleep overnight is the fear that one day the people on the street will rise against them
812323 theres a short window of time before it really gets ugly it would be historically criminal criminal for the future of our planet if the world community doesnt give this process a chance because by then it would too late
812324 the achilles heel of this regime is certainly not by taking up arms and fighting them in decades long wars and conflicts let the iranian people gain back their freedom with your support youre not there to dictate to them a solution youre not there to dictate to them an outcome let them make their own decision

812454 i was just trying to find the strike zone and i ended up throwing it up and away it was a pitch that a pitcher can handle

812587 we have been receiving calls from the community asking if a firefighter can check their childs car seat to see if it was safe or installed properly so with that the wellington fire district sent one of our guys derick oswald to a 32 hour class in medina so that he could become a certified technician derick then went out with some of the other guys from the department and raised funds from the community to buy supplies for the event in total we raised around 3 000 00 and it is all going back into the community
812588 the class was held at the easter seals in medina and was a 32 hour course spread out over a couple weeks the first day we just learned all about cars and seat belts every car has a different seat belt system theres nothing straight across the board each car has something different on the second day we learned about infant only car seats and convertible car seats the third day was booster seats and specialty seats like airline seats
812589 the first thing we do is identify the car seat we try to identify any recalls we have an updated recall list that we printed out with us to cross check the next step is to identify the manufacturer of the car how do they want the child seat installed in the car we look at the manual of the car seat and make sure that we are installing it properly according to the manufacturer of the car seat
812590 if i just check the seat then install it snuggly and let them go on their way then two months down the road they need to move the seat out and reinstall it they are lost we explain everything we are doing along the way and then uninstall it and let them reinstall it with us watching

812690 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
812691 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
812692 because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain
812693 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
812694 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
812695 what we want to see is these 3 500 pipes reviewed quickly so that if any of them are causing serious environmental problems it can be dealt with
812696 what we would like to see from the courts are greater fines handed out to water companies for pollution offences
812697 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
812698 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
812699 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
812700 we expect companies to be proactive in identifying intermittent discharges such as cso and emergency overflows from pumping stations that are at risk of becoming unsatisfactory

812766 the teachings of osiris and jesus are wonderfully alike many passages are identically the same word for word
812767 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
812768 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
812769 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
812770 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
812771 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
812772 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
812773 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
812774 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
812775 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
812776 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
812777 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
812778 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
812779 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
812780 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
812781 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
812782 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
812783 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
812784 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
812785 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
812786 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
812787 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
812788 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
812789 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
812790 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
812791 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
812792 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
812793 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
812794 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
812795 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
812796 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
812797 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
812798 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
812799 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
812800 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
812801 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
812802 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
812803 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
812804 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
812805 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
812806 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
812807 who are open to doing something on the production side
812808 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
812809 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
812810 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
812811 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
812812 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
812813 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
812814 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
812815 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
812816 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
812817 yeah stick whats up i heard you had a third leg
812818 im sorry if i offend you no i take that back you are nuts

812822 we are delighted to be working with the mla and the lmlag on this important new initiative a wide range of invaluable online resources are within the reach of museum budgets in many cases for the first time
812823 we are delighted to be working with the mla and the lmlag on this important new initiative the considerable discounts that have been achieved through negotiation at a national level mean that a wide range of invaluable online resources are within the reach of museum budgets in many cases for the first time

812825 the transition programme has pursued a joined up approach taken over the last two years with support from becta janet edina jisc rscs third party providers and publishers together with he and fe institutions
812826 it is also a time to think of those who are missing loved ones and the distress they experience at not knowing where a loved family member is or why they disappeared
812827 we only have the one unsolved case of a person missing from mudgee and that is the unsolved disappearance of michelle mills
812828 this matter has been the subject of a coronial inquest in october 2006 when deputy state coroner milovanovich found that mills had most likely met with foul play and authorised a death certificate be issued
812829 this case is now a cold case that will be investigated by a special task force but police would still like to hear of any information no matter how small that anyone may have in relation to this case
812830 missing persons week is a time for those who think they may have information to michelle mills disappearance and if they have contact police
812831 i appeal to anyone who thinks they have information about michelles disappearance to think of her family at this time and contact police no matter how petty they may think their information is
812832 i actually cant see so i cant be that clever
812833 but i must share with everyone who worked with me
812834 from her fundraising achievements with the mudgee black and white committee to her passion for increasing the publics awareness of the issues associated with blindness and low vision mrs lovetts dedication is a real inspiration
812835 if something needs doing we just put it into action
812836 built in 1881 the organ is one of only two of its kind in australia
812837 it has a very germanic influence in its sound and when built was 100 years ahead of its time
812838 restoration was essential as it was very worn the pipes had lost their resonance and the bellows had deteriorated badly
812839 in some places elastic bands were holding its parts together
812840 the final voicing and tuning of the organ mark the end of a very satisfying project
812841 the best organists in nsw such as st johns own gavin tipping peter jewkes from christ church st lawrence and rev michael deasey precentor at the bathurst cathedral will play at the rededication
812842 the whole restoration came to around 160 000 with more than two thirds from the mudgee community via appeals and fund raising events
812843 the nsw heritage council gave the church a grant of 50 000 to assist with the work
812844 now we are able to say thank you to the commmunity with concerts and recitals of all kinds and with top quality music that only an organ can provide
812845 severely damaged pipes were sent to melbourne specialist pipe makers where perished cork bung tuning stoppers were replaced with new spotted metal felted tuning canisters to ensure tuning stability
812846 despite being disabled jan doesnt allow it to get in the way of helping others
812847 these are the unsung heroes in the community who often go unthanked and unpraised
812848 they are the carers who deserve to be recognised for their work with people with disabilities
812849 we have entered to raise money for the nets team nets is the nsw newborn and paedeatric emergency transport service they are specialist doctors and nurses who attend a critically ill child or newborn then treat stabilise and move the patient the medical team bring with them a fully equipped mobile intensive care unit
812850 tim was lucky to have an amazing team whose incredible care helped to save his life whilst he was still in mudgee hospital and en route to sydney as part of his rescue tim was taken by helicopter to westmead hospital in sydney the pilots were also extremely talented ensuring that the helicopter hovered until tim could be stabilised with the differing air pressures
812851 this service has extra significance in rural areas where larger hospitals with intensive care facilities are often long distances away such as dubbo which for us would be 1 5 hours by road
812852 as you can see it was a very difficult time for us all but the love and care tim received was just outstanding so we would like to go some small way to help them out
812853 for us it will be more of a race in the loosest sense of the word as we will be walking and pushing a pram although not dressed as gorillas

812857 at first we considered opening a takeaway vietnamese restaurant but decided it would have been too full on for jeany as i know very little about cooking
812858 then we got in touch with the business enterprise centre and enrolled in a four week new enterprise incentive scheme course on starting up a new business
812859 its a great program and really helped us both financially and with management practices
812860 neither of us had operated a business before so it was a fantastic way to help us get ajs up and running
812861 he already had all the contacts so he agreed to give me a hand

812887 in evolutionary terms women bear the brunt of parental care and it has been generally thought that it was to their advantage to choose their mate carefully and remain faithful to make sure that their mate had no reason to believe he was raising another mans child but recently biologists have suggested that females could benefit from mating with many men it would increase the genetic diversity of their children and if a high quality man would not stay with them forever they might at least get his excellent genes for their child
812888 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
812889 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
812890 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
812891 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
812892 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
812893 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
812894 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
812895 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
812896 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
812897 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
812898 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

812901 the surge has reduced violence we should all be thrilled about that and honored by the brilliance of those who have served in iraq but what were talking about here is whipped cream on a pile of fertilizer a regional policy unprecedented in its stupidity and squalor
812902 for a long time there has been a reaction building among jewish progressives a phrase that seems oddly represent the american jewish community as i have pointed out without american jews the organized antiwar movement would be significantly smaller as well as a lot less organized that is certainly the case around antiwar coms virtual office

812904 see the new boss same as the old boss which is essentially what you have to look forward to in the current electoral process
812905 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
812906 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
812907 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
812908 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
812909 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
812910 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
812911 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
812912 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
812913 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
812914 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
812915 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
812916 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
812917 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
812918 it would take unfathomable millions multiple millions and millions of dollars
812919 the idea was to design a building that would actually help your mind recover

812930 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
812931 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

812942 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
812943 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
812944 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

812948 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
812949 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
812950 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans

812961 the number of americans being investigated dwarfs any legitimate number of actual terrorism prosecutions and that is extremely troubling for both the security and privacy of innocent americans as well as for the squandering of resources on people who have not and never will be charged with any wrongdoing

812968 on wednesday july 9 the senate voted to pass the fisa amendments act

813012 the poor kid hes been copping it every single time
813013 i feel sorry for him because its just doing his head in i think weve got a glimmer of hope that we can still resurrect some part of his finals campaign but well just have to wait and see
813014 he was icing it halfway up the leg if it was torn off the bone it would be higher
813015 but there is concern that theres a tear as well as a cork all will be revealed by tuesday but i would say he would definitely miss next week

813029 id be focusing a lot on the pain of missing out on finals but also hammering home to the younger brigade what it means to play in one
813030 it flies in the face of living in the moment but it is so near they are on the cusp there is a big game coming up and they need to be reminded exactly what they are going for
813031 the younger guys will never forget the experience of playing in their first finals and it can be a launching pad for years to come
813032 i would keep it separate from what we achieved this is a new group that needs to think about the present
813033 i would look at last year and not necessarily grand final day but finals the concept of finals

813133 rupert murdoch said the best thing that will come out of the iraq war will be oil at 20 a barrel now today when i came here i looked and it was 130 something when is rupert going to explain why the war didnt give us 20 a barrel oil
813134 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813135 its totally prohibited to give unlimited contributions to political parties its totally prohibited for a corporation or a union to just go right into its treasury and give money to political parties yet under an exemption that was created by the federal election commission which essentially is made up of representatives of the two major parties all of this money can be given if its given through a host committee under the pretense that its merely to promote the convention city
813136 in return for this money the parties through the host committees offer access to top politicians to the president the future president vice president cabinet officials senators congressmen they promise these companies who are giving that they will be able to not only get close to these people by hosting receptions by access to vip areas but theyll actually have meetings with them
813137 lavish conventions with million dollar podiums fancy skyboxes and broadway production teams are not necessary to the democratic process
813138 congress should pass a law that says no more soft money for these conventions no corporate treasury union treasury no unlimited individual money instead the discard this host committee fiction can go out there and ask people to help the convention but with the same limits where theyre asking people to help them normally

813141 were talking about the regime with the worst human rights record in the continent and the army with the worst human rights record in the continent with the greatest u s support including the contractors or mercenaries so the fact that this regime was involved in this liberation does not and should not and cannot cover up the fact that it is a horrendous regime
813142 torture massacres disappearances and killings of noncombatants are widespread and collusion between the armed forces and paramilitary groups continues to this day in 2006 u s assistance to colombia amounted to an estimated 728 million approximately 80 percent of which was military and police assistance
813143 supplied directly or through contractors troop transportation planning facilities and fuel to colombian military aircraft including the helicopter crew accused of dropping the bomb

813148 hate breeds hate the united states said they were doing this to rout out terrorism who is engaged in terrorism now
813149 im very happy to be in sudan but im very sad because of the situation of our brothers who remain in guantanamo conditions in guantanamo are very very bad and they get worse by the day our human condition our human dignity was violated and the american administration went beyond all human values all moral values all religious values in guantanamo you have animals that are called iguanas rats that are treated with more humanity but we have people from more than 50 countries that are completely deprived of all rights and privileges and they will not give them the rights that they give to animals
813150 they hold the quran in contempt destroyed it several times and put their dirty feet on it they also sat on the quran while trying to get us angry they repeatedly committed violations against our dignity and our sexual organs
813151 during these times the interrogations were all about al jazeera and alleged relations between al jazeera and al qaida they tried to induce him to spy on his colleagues at al jazeera
813152 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813153 part of the reason is that the people who write about global warming for most newspapers and tv are not the same people as those who tend to cover weather in general the media is covering this as all sort of unconnected events just regular weather maybe gone a little wacky but in fact the scientific community has predicted for more than two decades now that as we pour more heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the planet will heat up and that would redistribute water if you heat up the planet you evaporate more water and areas that are wetter will tend to see more intense rainfall and deluges and earlier snowmelts and all that will lead to flooding so what were seeing is exactly what scientists have been telling us would happen because of human emissions
813154 not even a few weeks before this all happened we were in the middle of doing a climate change series thats going to run over the year we had two page graphic talking about the different things that would happen in iowa as a result of climate change and pointing out that you would expect more torrential rains what has happened here is consistent with many scientists view of what global warming will mean in the midwest
813155 if a meteorologist cant speak to the fundamental science of climate change then maybe the ams american meteorological society shouldnt give them a seal of approval if a meteorologist has an ams seal of approval which is used to confer legitimacy to tv meteorologists then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming
813156 weve got to have a national mission of converting our economy and the example for the world is solar energy 4 billion years of supply it is environmentally benign decentralized makes us energy independent and replaces the exxonmobil peabody coal uranium complex that is why we have got to go for economic political health and safety reasons
813157 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813158 obama represents all the promise of america that a biracial man from a broken family can rise and have a strong shot of becoming our next president
813159 im not endorsing anybody our country has elected white males from northern european countries going back now 230 or so years this finally represents that the top position in american government is really open to everyone and i think thats sending a powerful message not only to americans but throughout the world
813160 in justice inside the scandal that rocked the bush administration
813161 is when you send voter information to a group of people that you have reason to believe are no longer there such as military personnel who are overseas such as students at historically black colleges when it comes back as undeliverable the party uses that information to remove that person from the voter rolls claiming they are no longer there it is a reprehensible practice i had never heard of it until after i left office
813162 i hope the media keeps shining the spotlight on groups like the american center for voting rights which has been engaging in this type of voter suppression action especially targeting the elderly people and minorities if you are an american citizen who is not a felon you have the right to vote i would just hope that in swing states like missouri wisconsin new mexico and a handful of other states that the democratic party and the media really keep a lot of pressure on this
813163 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813164 senator obama unequivocally opposes giving retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies and has cosponsored senator dodds efforts to remove that provision from the fisa bill granting such immunity undermines the constitutional protections americans trust the congress to protect senator obama supports a filibuster of this bill and strongly urges others to do the same
813165 wrong vote regrettable many democrats will do this we should be standing up for the constitution when sen obama is president he will im sure work to fix some of this but its going to be a lot easier to prevent it now than to try to fix it later
813166 senator obama we are a proud group of your supporters who believe in your call for hope and a new kind of politics please reject the politics of fear on national security vote against this bill and lead other democrats to do the same
813167 sometimes during campaigns the rhetoric gets overheated and amplified my core position has never changed ive always been a proponent of free trade

813171 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813172 i actually think that we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
813173 the nuclear revival that we often hear about is not actually happening it is a very carefully fabricated illusion there are no buyers wall street is not putting a penny of private capital into the industry despite 100 plus percent subsidies
813174 basically we can have as many nuclear plants as congress can force the taxpayers to pay for but you wont get any in a market economy
813175 the first issue to come up for me would be the spread of nuclear weapons which it greatly facilitates if you look at places like iran and north korea how do you think theyre doing it iran claims to be making electricity vital to its development the technology materials equipment skills are applicable to both the president is absolutely right in identifying the spread of nuclear weapons as the gravest threat to our security so its really puzzling to me that hes trying to accelerate that spread every way he can think of its just an awful idea unless youre really interested in making bombs hes really triggered a new mideast arms race by trying to push nuclear power within the region
813176 about as fat a terrorist target as you can imagine it is not necessary to fly a plane into a nuclear plant or storm a plant and take over a control room in order to cause that material to be largely released you can often do it from outside the site boundary with things the terrorists would have readily available
813177 it stays dangerous for a very long time so you have to put it someplace that stays away from people and life and water for a very long time millions of years most likely so far all the places weve looked turned out to be geologically unsuitable including yucca mountain
813178 one of the big reasons we have an oil problem and a climate problem today is we spent our money on the wrong stuff if we had spent it on efficiency and renewables those problems wouldve gone away and we wouldve made trillions of dollars profit on the deal because its so much cheaper to save energy than to supply it
813179 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813180 so while it was a terrible mistake for the administration to rely on the erroneous intelligence about wmd and i mean it was catastrophic to our credibility first of all it was an honest error and not a lie but even if you correct it for that error what we found in iraq was a serious wmd threat even though saddam hussein had chosen to not maintain the stockpiles he had put himself in a position where he could have regenerated those stockpiles in three to five weeks
813181 to prove that there is nothing is almost impossible i think that if we had been in iraq for a couple of months more it would have been enough to make it extremely clear to everybody that the chances were real that there were no weapons of mass destruction
813182 i wish to heaven that they had listened a little better to what i had to say if they did listen
813183 it is hard to avoid the impression that almost 20 years after the end of the cold war military calculations still dominate the long term thinking about major global relations terrorism is formally made the chief enemy but precautions are taken against the growing power of china and russia
813184 the idea of giving enriched uranium to the saudis while threatening war with the iranians for enriching uranium is astonishing the idea that the saudis are going to somehow lower the price of oil on the basis of possibly getting nuclear reactors in the future is just almost staggering to think about
813185 then i think its very likely that the chinese who have not ratified will follow if china does it maybe india does if india does pakistan does etc and the treaty would enter into force it would be a great thing if we outlawed any nuclear weapons tests in the future
813186 to negotiate a new instrument of international humanitarian law banning cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians

813188 old old alcoholics who could only shovel gravel but they knew songs
813189 ammon came to me one day and said youve got to be a pacifist and i said hows that he said well you act out a lot you use a lot of violent behavior and i was you know i was very angry youre not just going to lay down guns and fists and knives and hard angry words youre going to have to lay down the weapons of privilege and go into the world completely disarmed if theres one struggle that animates my life its probably that one
813190 i was a state archivist and ran a full campaign 27 counties we took 6 000 votes in utah but when it was over my job would vanish and i couldnt get work anymore in utah
813191 the trade is a fine elegant beautiful very fruitful trade in that trade i can make a living and not a killing
813192 i dont want to contribute anything to that industry i cant fault you for what youre doing i admire what you do but i cant feed that dragon think about dollars as bullets
813193 the long memory is the most radical idea in america that long memory has been taken away from us you havent gotten it in your schools youre not getting it on your television youre being leapfrogged from one crisis to the next mass media contributed to that by taking the great movements that weve been through and trivializing important events no our peoples history is like one long river it flows down from way over there and everything that those people did and everything they lived flows down to me and i can reach down and take out what i need if i have the courage to go out and ask questions

813197 we are holding this demonstration because we are hungry we need to eat we need to work we are hungry thats all we are hungry
813198 the specter of widespread hunger malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale
813199 hunger is on the march here garbage is carefully sifted for whatever food might be left young babies wail in frustration seeking milk from a mother too anemic to produce it
813200 burning food today so as to serve the mobility of the rich countries is a crime against humanity
813201 the truth of the matter is its in our national interests that our farmers grow energy as opposed to us purchasing energy from parts of the world that are unstable or may not like us
813202 is this a price blip no a food shortage not that either we are in a structural meltdown the direct result of three decades of neoliberal globalization we have allowed food to be transformed from something that nourishes people and provides them with secure livelihoods into a commodity for speculation and bargaining
813203 the amount of speculative money in commodities futures was less than 5 billion in 2000 last year it ballooned to roughly 175 billion
813204 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
813205 here i am a republican thinking about nationalizing health care it just went against the grain of everything that i stood for but you have to remember i didnt come to those conclusions with lofty ideals of social justice
813206 youre seeing an ever increasing number of people starting to support a national health program in fact 59 percent of practicing physicians today believe that we need to have a national health program i mean thats unheard of even 10 years ago its amazing to see a new generation of physicians coming up who are disgusted with our current health care system you know were trained to be advocates of patients were trained to save lives were trained to practice medicine and instead what were doing is were practicing wall street economics
813207 i know a lot of people favor it but for many reasons it is difficult to achieve
813208 health care meltdown confronting the myths and fixing our failing system
813209 there are a lot of different types of single payer systems you could have purely socialized medicine thats kind of like what england has the government owns the hospitals the government owns the clinics the government finances all the health care and all the doctors work for the government that is truly socialized medicine as opposed to the canadian system where the financing comes through their medicare program but all the doctors are in private practice
813210 you know this industry is a 2 trillion industry and the profits in the for profit insurance industry are so huge and its so deeply entrenched into wall street but until we move to a single payer system and get rid of the profit motive in financing of health care we will not be able to fix the problems that we have
813211 i think that our current presidential candidates understand that ideally single payer would be the best but they dont have the political will to move that forward their job is to feel which way the wind is blowing our job is to turn that wind

813215 if the gay movement needs a paradise sweden is the place the veritable valhalla here i have seen the incredible members of the parliament cabinet and people from socio religio political spheres replete with multi gender proclivities hobnob without the blinking of an eye
813216 in india the hypocrisy and worse the cowardice is nauseating in our parliament and state legislatures homosexuality is and has always been rampant
813217 but when we the gay movement strive to overturn a senseless law will any single one of these stand up and support the proposal
813218 the draconian ipc section 377 making homosexuality a crime has no bearing on the reality of our times leave alone the times when it was imposed upon an unsuspecting public unsuspecting because the illiterate masses were attuned to following official diktats without a word and those who could understand were too cowardly to raise a voice

813221 we have fertile land and irrigation system our societies are agrarian we export agro products to the rest of the world
813222 yet the region faces food shortages from time to time
813223 maintaining present monetary stance would cause further inflammation of commodities prices could disrupt supplies and could cause significant world recession and disorderly financial markets
813224 in order to rein in inflation and bring back a measure of stability in commodities and financial markets monetary policy has to be tightened considerably and be directed to strictly controlling credit and money supply
813225 similar financial crisis can be easily predicted in future as a consequence of overly expansionary monetary policy
813226 credit to economy has expanded at a fast pace in many countries including major industrial countries at the expense of creditworthiness and credit quality contributing to a rapid increase in aggregate demand for real assets goods and services
813227 credit expansion contributed to high speculation in many assets and commodities markets
813228 most striking consumer price indices cpis in many industrial countries a leading indicator for the conduct of monetary policy were not sensitive to high increases in commodities or housing prices
813229 in spite of a fast rise in housing energy and food prices cpis continued to show small increases by about 2 3 percent in industrial countries during 2003 07 indicating puzzling price stability and almost no inflation
813230 such was not the case during the seventies when cpis were highly sensitive to oil shocks and rapid increase in energy prices
813231 insensitivity of cpis to commodities prices and to low nominal interest rates may lead policymakers to downplay the risk of inflation while there is ongoing abnormally high asset and commodities price inflation
813232 with the effect of expansionary monetary policy building momentum and demand expanding commodities prices became almost uniformly under pressure with price increases accelerating to unprecedented double digit rates
813233 without accommodative money supply prices and exchange rates cannot sustain persistent changes
813234 the distinction between demand pull cost push inflation becomes irrelevant and the only way out of inflation is to restrain money supply and credit
813235 monetary authorities will face political conflicts stemming from debtors pressure to keep inflating the economy in order to increase their wealth and lower their debt burden

813250 we want to congratulate the strong leadership and commitment of the house members who supported this legislation to protect hoosier kids from the tobacco industry

813346 dalam beberapa tahun ke depan cara itu akan semakin marak dipakai sindikat karena mereka tahu celah hukumnya sangat besar oleh karena itu negara ini makin bertransformasi menjadi negara produsen karena secara hukum memang kondusif padahal di negara negara tetangga saja prekursor ini diawasi sangat ketat dan kepemilikannya secara gelap diancam hukuman sangat berat
813347 jadi laboratoriumnya dipecah pecah di beberapa tempat dan cara itu lebih menyulitkan polisi untuk melacaknya
813348 impor nonfarmasi sejauh ini harus mendapatkan dulu rekomendasi dari bareskrim dan bnn badan narkotika nasional sehingga lebih terawasi namun impor farmasi belum tetapi isunya yang lebih penting adalah kita sangat butuh payung perundangan yang mengatur prekursor bukan soal izin izin itu tanpa meniadakan kepentingan sediaan farmasi

813370 i like the first half of the new coldplay more
813371 considering there are so many issues legitimate issues that you can use on barack obama to attack his wife to me is sheer utter stupidy of the highest level
813372 mr obama is going to come to his wifes defense and its going to humanize both of them
813373 from more aggressively courting young people earlier to mobilizing the full power of women there are things that could have been done differently while everyone loves to talk about the message campaigns are equally about money and organization having raised more than 100 million in 2007 the clinton campaign found itself without adequate money at the beginning of 2008 and without organizations in a lot of states as a result given her successes in high turnout primary elections and defeats in low turnout caucuses that simple fact may just have had a lot more to do with who won than anyone imagines
813374 but wasnt it the message that drove people to donate to obama
813375 you can have the best technology in the world but if you dont have a community who wants to use it and who are excited about it then it has no purpose
813376 democracy has prevailed stability remains in place we have successfully fulfilled our responsibility in recent weeks
813377 the problem of violence against police officers has grown over the last few years the police has to increasingly focus on self protection during their tours of duty
813378 when the colleagues go on a tour of duty they dont know anymore what will happen to them
813379 earlier people thought that what the police do is right today people assume that we are doing something wrong
813380 there is no more respect of the authority of the state among citizens especially among young people of foreign origin
813381 the voices come from all sides and suddenly you get a hit in the back you cant even look that fast says de fries
813382 with the turks and the albanians it always goes over the parents
813383 continuously small offences are provoked even if a police car is in sight
813384 riotous assemblies of parts of the population during police tasks are becoming an ever increasing problem time and again a hostile atmosphere towards the police appears

813402 oh thanks oh jesus now its asking for my phone number what the hell am i suppose to put here why cant i just do it the old fashioned way
813403 yes it was so much easier these fancy computers are just so complicated i never understand what i am suppose to do
813404 i need lsd for my son you have that right
813405 i think someone is standing next to your satellite with a ham radio you need to run out and get them to stop
813406 i will have you know son i am a gunnery sergeant ive worked with hand operated radios for years and im telling you right now there is someone standing next to your satellite with a d radio and its interfering with my signal i demand you to get out there and tell them to stop
813407 far be it from me to ever argue with my clients but i will have to at this time i understand that youre a gunny sergeant and that youve operated ham radios for years but i know my satellite equipment and its not possible for someone to be standing next to my satellite with a radio
813408 because our satellites are in outer space furthermore las vegas has an outage going on due to a technical issue with their broadcasting equipment
813409 go ahead and click on the printer and faxes icon

813414 what are all these gay cowboys doing at the goth night
813415 it was taking all necessary precautions to prevent the documents from becoming lucrative merchandise on the black market
813416 exporting the creation of our valuable identification documents to multiple countries with terrorist ties or otherwise anti us agendas
813417 the foreign office insisted the blank documents are unusable because of their high tech chip security features
813418 so the embassies must have the means to create a
813419 the good passport thefts occur where no one ever realizes the passports were stolen
813420 where there is lack of shared purpose information sharing leads to chaos
813421 we must treat every suspicious item the same and utilize the tools we have available to make a final determination
813422 procedures are in place for a reason and this is a clear indication our workforce is doing a great job
813423 its not just bombs that are prohibited its things that look like bombs this looks enough like a bomb to fool the other passengers and that in itself is a threat
813424 but the average person doesnt know what a bomb looks like
813425 do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb
813426 do as i say or i will blow up the plane
813427 and in todays passengers fight back world do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb
813428 i have an idea how about people quit the complaining and just stop flying if they dont like they way they are treated at airports
813429 transportation security officer scot peele leveraged his training and experience when he detected the suspicious item while monitoring the x ray image of the passengers carry on bag
813430 it is unfortunate that we had to waste passengers time and screening resources on this incident please dont bring jury rigged or jerry built diy devices through the security line
813431 remember how passengers saved the plane from richard reid they stopped him from setting his shoes on fire because they thought it was suspicious if you bring something onto a plane that looks very suspicious passengers may react badly when you pull it out i e they may tackle you therefore airport security is quite right to prevent suspicious devices from going on the plane in the first place
813432 as some commentators have pointed out this guy was something of an idiot for bringing his contraption on the plane in the first place
813433 if looking like a tv bomb is the problem terrorists just need to make something that doesnt look like a tv bomb
813434 i read once that a cell phone battery has the energy equivalent of a hand gernade
813435 whatever the tsa agent thinks other people might think is a bomb
813436 i read once that a cell phone battery has the energy equivalent of a hand gernade
813437 no you cant bring a home made battery on the plane and create inordinate unknown risk for everyone else just for the sake of your stupid dvd watching
813438 are you certain your bags contain no electrical or electronic items
813439 actually im certain they do in fact theyre about half electronics by volume
813440 i have an idea how about people quit the complaining and just stop flying if they dont like they way they are treated at airports
813441 for six long minutes on june 30 screening operations froze
813442 not cooperating all while your fellow passangers say things like
813443 the tsa needs little stickers like the wal mart smilies you get when you bring something back to the store to return it
813444 we obviously had a lapse of judgement on this story and you folks in the blogosphere have done a good job of keeping us honest the points made by gizmodo boing boing and bruce schneier were compelling
813445 first the headline is misleading we totally over hyped it
813446 a suspicious looking item is not the burden of proof for surrender of said item this looks much more like the wylie coyote bomb of yesteryear in this case the item was easy to spot but not harmful tsa finds far more interesting items through improvised explosive device ied drills every day
813447 to be clear we did not doctor the photo the wire was not attached to the bottle but was resting underneath it as the passenger placed it in the bin
813448 there is credibility to looking at batteries as they are commonly improvised by terrorists click here
813449 okay thats fair but the average person doesnt know what a bomb looks like all he knows is what he sees on television and the movies and this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who doesnt know better the rule just doesnt work

813481 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
813482 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
813483 its just going to be lifting it a little bit its not actually taking it out of the water

813537 tactically it was thought clever to define by reference to tb ie this was not the era of spin we are going to be honest the style would change etc
813538 the consequence was twofold we dissed our own record instead of saying we are building on the achievements confronting new challenges we joined in the attack on our own 10 years a fatal mistake we junked the tb policy agenda but had nothing to put in its place
813539 we took the benefit of the anti tb feeling but ended up accepting our opponents propaganda and appearing incapable of articulating a forward policy agenda

813573 what he ledger does with the joker is quite frankly nothing short of transcendent
813574 ledger was a master of his craft only in his final years finding roles that truly offered him the chance to explore that mastery his is the definitive movie joker and he owns the role and achieves a level of abject insanity that is terrifying as it is irresistible
813575 this is a dark scary movie that a lot of nine year olds arent going to be able to sit through without crying at least once watching its heavy weight press against my accelerating heartbeat like the best deep fried bacon and cheddar cheese sandwich i could only marvel at its pitch black soul i havent seen a pg 13 rated film this horrifying in a long time its attempts at setting up a realistic pulp atmosphere ultimately achieve a blissful state of being and in the end we are given a true masterpiece of summer filmmaking
813576 this ledgers performance is truly one time when no amount of hype can prepare you for what you will see this man doing on screen he has crafted and constructed one of the most truly amazing on screen villains of all time
813577 three days after the screening i am still haunted by some visual images lines of cynical dialogue particularly by the sinister joker splendidly and scarily played by heath ledger who should receive a posthumous oscar nomination if not the award itself
813578 martin scorseses the departed michael manns heat brian de palmas the untouchables and now christopher nolans the dark knight can join the ranks as one of the best crime dramas in modern movie history its only incidental its set in the fictional gritty city of gotham and it just happens to feature a superhero wearing a bat suit and an arch villain in clown makeup
813579 the dark knight is not only the best film i have seen this year but quite possibly the best superhero movie ever made
813580 when the dark knight came to a end i sat there in stunned silence not able to say a word i wanted to say something but my brain mouth and heart were unable to work in conjunction to express what was going on inside of me i was in complete and total awe of what i had just witnessed for the last 2 and a half hours on that screen
813581 bottom line the dark knight is the best by far batman film that weve ever seen
813582 it isnt an overstatement to call the dark knight the most sophisticated and ambitious work of its kind superior to all three spider man installments and even its amazing predecessor
813583 the dark knight qualifies as the first official comic book adaptation that truly succeeds in being a great artistic achievement
813584 what he ledger does with the joker is quite frankly nothing short of transcendent
813585 ledger was a master of his craft only in his final years finding roles that truly offered him the chance to explore that mastery his is the definitive movie joker and he owns the role and achieves a level of abject insanity that is terrifying as it is irresistible

813607 when i served in iraq i guarded some chemical spills sites and was exposed to depleted uranium from weapons use in one specific incident our company was called in to guard what seemed to be an old sealed bunker we were wearing our normal protective gear it was very dark inside but when we found unknown chemicals a nuclear biological chemical specialist was called in for testing when he recognized one of the chemicals he quickly left the site and returned in full protective gear we immediately put on our masks and worked our way out of the building when the testing was done a higher echelon of testers was brought in while we continued to guard at the door of the bunker based on the seriousness of the results we were told to leave the bunker and stay approximately a mile away

813619 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs

813624 several weeks back james vastbinder was able to coax jack gudenkauf into doing an interview on
813625 there are still people in my life who dont believe in me who perhaps think im too much like them to be a writer not quite the type who could get a novel published but whats relevant is i dont feel that way im pushing myself up against everyones expectations stretching reaching for goals beyond my skills of today to be a better writer tomorrow
813626 amy said larramie thanks so much its such a pleasure seeing your post here daisies figure prominently in my novel
813627 i had no intention of turning that first chapter into a book i didnt believe in it enough
813628 however the writers group lisa hannah and lynne wanted to know more
813629 but that first time i shared clara with them they empathized with her they felt her pain and also wanted to know more about another character a little girl who played in the funeral home they were intrigued and i a writer in search of approval was hooked by their interest
813630 now that ive completed my book i often wonder if i would have continued on without the support given me by my writers group they believed in me and my writing and thats a mighty powerful gift
813631 this much i know is true had they not been there every step of the way it would not have become a manuscript i believe in too
813632 clara marsh is an undertaker who doesnt believe in god
813633 it changes even more when detective mike sullivan starts questioning her again about a body she prepared three years ago an unidentified girl found murdered in a nearby strip of woods unclaimed by family the community christened her precious doe when clara and mike learn trecie may be involved with the same people who killed precious doe clara must choose between the stead fast existence of loneliness and the perils of binding ones life to another
813634 larramie said the excerpt of tethered told by a gentle voice assured me that amys story wouldnt be horrifying i admit to steering clear of this subject matter yet knew i would read this novel for two reasons curiosity and amys writing storytelling being honored to receive an arc i read each page with an ever growing lump in my throat but not for the child tethered is a brutally gorgeous novel that cuts deeply while making you stronger for caring about unforgettable characters
813635 my theme is and always will be faith my faith is a tenuous thing i had it once and have longed for it ever since its difficult to navigate the dark passages of life without believing there is some higher power at work that there exists order where we see only randomness and chaos my novel began with a question how could an undertaker perform her work if she didnt believe in god i layered into that premise another question i struggle with daily why do children need to suffer to die
813636 so in spite of the thoughtful suggestion to make that revision i expect to stay with what i have i feel strongly that it works better for the story and is more satisfying for the reader mostly i need to create a sense of faith within myself where for now none exists
813637 im always at the too much store come and visit me

813642 we commend our industry partners like xantrex for making this city tour a reality
813643 industry partners are necessary because solar energy is complex there are key concepts like interconnection standards net metering and others that national state and local officials need to understand in order to make the right decisions about solar for their communities we are simply bringing the knowledge to them as an industry so cities can deploy cost effective solar energy when and where it makes sense to them
813644 to be right we must think worthily of god it is morally imperative that we purge from our minds all ignoble concepts of the diety and let him be the god in our minds that he is in his universe
813645 the mind looks backward in time till the dim past vanishes then turns and looks into the future till thought and imagination collapse from exhaustion and god is at both points unaffected by either

813664 resolutely prevent severe violence and terrorist incidents resolutely prevent severe political incidents that could affect state security and social stability and resolutely prevent large scale mass incidents to make sure the objective of a safe olympic games is reached
813665 it would appear that one of the differences now is that the government is actively encouraging patriotism whether in the form on national education or trying to persuade the media to take a more active role in promoting understanding of the country
813666 a growing reluctance on the part of many media outlets to tackle issues that are sensitive to the government in beijing
813667 this exclusion of opinions would see honk kong developing a lack of tolerance that would marginalize dissenting voices and persuade people that it is in their best interest not to speak out even though they know an injustice has been done
813668 the chinese authorities have broken their promise to improve the countrys human rights situation and betrayed the core values of the olympics
813669 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
813670 they must release all imprisoned peaceful activists allow foreign and national journalists to report freely and make further progress towards the elimination of the death penalty
813671 amnesty can take off the tinted glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
813672 in the run up to the olympics the chinese authorities have locked up put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of stability and harmony they want to present to the world
813673 reports have just confirmed that foreign journalists working from the olympics press centre in beijing are unable to access amnesty org the amnesty international website
813674 in addition the china debate a site recently launched by amnesty international as a forum to discuss human rights has been blocked in china
813675 we are surprised at their iocs confidence that foreign media will be able to report freely and that there will be no internet censorship
813676 and they must speak out when the authorities violate the wider olympic principles
813677 there will be full open and free internet access during games time to allow journalists to report on the olympics
813678 but i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked
813679 there are some problems with a lot of websites themselves that makes it not easy to view them in china
813680 our attitude is to ensure that foreign journalists have regular access to information in china during the olympic games
813681 during the olympic games we will provide reporters with sufficient and convenient internet access so the olympic games will not be affected
813682 i am disappointed that the access to internet cant be wider
813683 but i cant tell the chinese authorities what they should do
813684 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
813685 china in an effort to ensure a perfect olympics has made beijing the most protected city in the history of the games
813686 along with uighur militants from xinjiang and tibetan freedom advocates the government has cracked down on activists beggars prostitutes and stray animals all of which threaten beijings desire to project a modern image during the games
813687 the security measures will include biometric keys fingerprinting and iris scanning for sensitive areas segway riding antiterrorist bomb squads and extensive video surveillance
813688 will be used to monitor rights advocates and political dissidents with even greater sophistication than before
813689 help visitors cross busy streets and keep an eye out for anything suspicious
813690 marred by protests and counterprotests and labeled a crisis even by international olympic committee president jacques rogge the torch relay has been a microcosm for the broader controversy surrounding the beijing games
813691 groups supporting autonomy for tibet received most of the attention but a variety of activists decrying chinas stance on democracy and promoting press freedom taiwanese nationalism and a range of human rights causes made their voices heard
813692 traveled the longest distance and included the greatest number of torchbearers since the tradition began in 1936 under adolf hitler
813693 many are already complaining that china has broken its word to allow the same media freedoms as previous olympics

813704 his tattoos mostly amount to groups of short parallel lines and their purpose may be related to their locations the back and leg tattoos coincide with typical acupuncture points for treating back and leg pain interestingly they also coincide with areas where otzi as he was nicknamed showed evidence of osteoarthritis but the prevailing theory about acupuncture says that it originated in china only about 2 000 to 3 000 years ago so either acupuncture is much more ancient than previously thought which seems likely or his tattoos were not therapeutic at all but perhaps used as an ethnic identifier a good luck charm or were simply body art

813708 i think the thing you americans and even many of japanese tv people didnt get from the killers note is that he is so empty he is empty in every way he is a hollow man there is no such thing like deep thought nor imagination no nothing but the envy to the others who seem to him that they got everything and strong resentment of course none of them are based on fact thought or any kind of intellectual activities i said he is a stupid piece of shit because he is trapped inside a trap of his own making it goes like this i am alone and pathetic because i couldnt win the game anyway because my face is ugly and my life is a mess that makes me alone and pathetic because back to top or it might go like this too people seem to be happy all the time but i am not because they have the love ones and money and car and steady job and but i dont have none that makes me a fucking looser but i cant do anything about it because i am ugly and my life is a mess so theres no chance that ill be happy ill never have a girlfriend that makes me unhappy people are happy because they stole my happiness or chicks to fuck i am alone and have nothing to do i am totally miserable on the other hand other people seem to be happy all the time back to top see how stupid and hollow it is the important fact is this is all he got in his entire fucking life what a waste of oxygen food water and humanity oh i forgot to tell you that he had one another thing its his memory of his elementary to junior high school age at that time he was a superman who was good at his study because his parents helped him and sport then he went to a good high school which is filled with real smart kids which he and his parents couldnt win his scores went down and so is his confidence he was empty from the beginning when grown up he started to blame his parents to have helped him back in that time he thinks his life went wrong because of that now you see why i said he was a kind of guy who is always waiting some lucky shit will happen to him without doing nothing anyway i am so sick and tired of this bitch fuck thanks

813778 this isnt working time to start over lets start by having a tea party
813779 i cant care about what our government does all over the world i have to trust that they know what theyre doing
813780 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species
813781 im an electrical engineering student and have chosen to do a project on poweline communictions
813782 actually i would like a system that has higher speeds i was even considering one that i could stream media with any suggestions my senior project isnt written in stone i havent turned in a proposal yet but its due very soon
813783 is it possible to interface with these devices for more than just simple computer networking also is it possible to decode data from them using a microcontroller instead of a pc id like to send custom data music video etc
813784 nos acechan nos ponen un blanco en la espalda escapemos pronto

813786 steve heres when you go live now go about your normal life
813787 oh well i didnt see it i think its kinda stupid
813788 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
813789 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
813790 im sorry diane ive had the luckiest life one could ask for its just that ive recently been diagnosed with relapsing remitting ms
813791 the very first case i won after finishing law school concerned a woman who had your exact same diagnoses
813792 maybe i should see an ms specialist ill try and find the number one authority on the west coast if he tells me my condition cant be caused by ms ill go ahead with the operation
813793 if you tell me my dead arm couldnt be caused by the ms ill have the operation
813794 spinal atrophy meant but when i returned to ucsf to present them with this possible diagnoses i found out it was just a fancy word for the spinal compression that had almost gotten me another unnecessary operation
813795 maybe the us was going into a major nose dive because of the catastrophic policies of the bush administration
813796 most of you are not aware that my space program retirement was denied to me
813797 extract from article basically the main thrust of this was that he is broke and owed money and by all accounts small changed i must note so would i be too maybe this is nothing if true of course but must be mentioned however
813798 when we are weak he is strong yes jesus loves me
813799 an employee selling 100k in product will be paid a 10 commission
813800 there were bad guys in your house and the police came
813801 the bingofuel reactor produces a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen coh2 and this gas can burn very cleanly in oxygen or air and so it can be used as fuel for an internal combustion engine
813802 stop throwing around bad science go to this site if you are interested in hydrogen powered cars if you call a single 12v battery some steel plates and salt water a large amount of energy than youve got problems
813803 the problem with making a car run on hydrogen isnt the amount of power required to produce the h its creating enough hydrogen quickly to meet up with the demand of a regular ice found in your car
813804 however if you really think that a car can be fuelled by hydrogen electrolysed using the output power of the engine with water being the only input then all i can say is try it and come back here when you have it working
813805 electrolyse water to produce h2 and burn it to fuel your engine
813806 its not the coal that drives the pistons its the water vapor why dont we make vapor mechanically save a bunch of money because the evil coal trusts dont want us to
813807 who cares if it breaks down after 10 000 hours of producing free energy
813808 some sites claim the o2 sensor needs to be fooled or this wont work due to the hho causing more complete combustion which means less unburned hydrocarbons and that leads to more o2 being detected so the computer makes the fuel air mix richer negating your fuel savings other sites dont mention this but id think it would be an important detail btw the sites that say its a problem offer to sell you just the thing to fix it
813809 i suppose if a car had a solar panel on the roof the electrolysis could be accomplished without a draw on the electrical system in daytime at least should that prove to be
813810 solar and wind power use up more oil energy than they can ever produce in their life
813811 if the cars battery is fully charged the alternators excess power generates the gas which is claimed will increase fuel economy and reduce emissions
813812 the solar panel idea i mentioned is not supposed to run the car entirely but 5kw from the example above is far more power than 2 amps off the alternator running for 10 hrs would provide
813813 in terms of pure cost youd be better off using mains power where its available
813814 both gasses are supposed to be used with this system so separating the h2 and o2 would defeat the purpose of the device which is to promote more complete combustion of the gasoline or diesel that will supposedly be interpreted by the vehicles computer via the o2 sensor as running lean
813815 im guessing that the additional fuel hydrogen gas added to the mix would be slight relative to the volume of air required by the engine so its effect on mileage or performance would be negligible then
813816 nearly impossible before i guess hp has made it more environmentally friendly or something the hp laserjet 2200dn at work gives me pretty much flawless results though

813828 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
813829 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together

813841 ice detains thousands of people who were born in the united states and puts the burden of proving citizenship on them often they are people who have limited communications skills and even more limited knowledge about their rights

813847 when youre in school you have a place in society youre a university student
813848 to these students i say i hope you return to your home country right away
813849 and i hope you repay what you have spent of other peoples money its a horrible crime
813850 these students have been here since they were small children and weve done everything to encourage them to stay in school and help them prepare for college
813851 the sad reality is most of these students are the best and the brightest
813852 they mostly hang around colleges assistantships getting paid to do surveys its not employment its catch as catch can
813853 i think continuing your studies is the best option for us now
813854 we dont train all students to become university professors they might end up working for an ngo non governmental organization or a film producer or in government service maybe not in the u s
813855 the reason i dont feel bad about it taking me so long to get through is that as long as im a ucla student i can say were on our way were up and comers
813856 has a choice to make become a legal resident or continue to live a life of deferring the task her parents should have taken care of years before
813857 naturally the uncertainty over my status has been a source of anxiety
813858 but ive tried to keep that anxiety quite separate from my academic and extracurricular pursuits i feel enormously privileged to have studied first at princeton and now at oxford
813859 i choose not to place the burden of my situation on everyone
813860 i have had the blessing of encountering a lot of people whove helped me
813861 a lot of stereotypes that linger on we break all of them
813862 all of us are very assimilated and were very proud of it were driven by huge optimism
813863 were always in a position where were oppressed and privileged at the same time
813864 i wonder if getting a phd in american studies is going to prove im an american
813865 id like to talk to you about opening a line of credit with our new offer from visa in conjunction with the university of houston all we need is your social security number
813866 are you a wetback are you scared that im going to turn you over to the police and youll get thrown outta my country why dont you just go back to mexico
813867 they said that they all had the same thing happen to them all the time
813868 simply cannot ignore the law we strongly urge the mulvihills to provide evidence showing their daughter is eligible for permanent residency
813869 we asked a gentleman from the state department after months we said what is going to happen to allie if you dont allow her to come here he said you have legally adopted her shes going to go to an orphanage and you must pay for this he said were going to put her back on the garbage heap she came from yeah this is how we were spoken to by our government
813870 i want to be able to have a job drive be able to vote everything else other people take for granted ive been here for 14 years i havent done anything wrong
813871 i worked so hard to get into uc davis and ive been wanting to go there since i was in my sophomore year
813872 its saddening but without loans we dont have the money to support my going to college
813873 the only way to survive was to leave the country
813874 my husband came here because he thought it was going to be safe for us
813875 i just kept up a really high standard for my grades through elementary and high school
813876 my mom really pushed on that its thanks to her
813877 youre taking a kid whos an advanced placement valedictorian type kid whos going to take his place in society and youre kicking him out
813878 i realize the wheels of justice are like the mills of god but 16 years is a really long time children need to get on with their lives
813879 its devastating for a family whos been here close to 20 years to be told now its time to go
813880 these determinations should be made more quickly because its not fair to families
813881 my strongest recommendation would be to provide free legal representation to people applying for asylum second would be to have some sort of review system when you have vast disparities between judges with issues that look pretty much the same third what kind of training is being provided to judges on country specific issues
813882 how can there be a rational argument against helping a child who has been raised here and has done well at school and has an opportunity to give back to this country its a chance for these kids to have a future particularly kids who find themselves in circumstances they could not prevent
813883 im hopeful that someday we can get our green cards and apply for citizenship but its looking pretty tough right now
813884 hajdari was a man of great integrity and we respected him very much
813885 shortly before 9 30 p m the telephone rang and hajdari spoke to the caller when he hung up the telephone he told us we have to leave immediately because izet haxhia had told us to come at once haxhia was the personal body guard of sali berisha who had become president of albania in 1992 berisha was the main leader of the party on 12 september 1998 i personally heard hajdari say the call was from haxhia
813886 and hajdari cerja and my cousin zenel neza went out and got into hajdaris car which was inside the walled compound cerja was driving hajdari was in the front passenger seat and zenel neza was in the back seat while i was closing the gate the car traveled out and turned right onto the street after it moved about four meters a black mercedes 500 with vlora license plates moved up and blocked its path there was a light gray jeep suv just behind the mercedes
813887 at about 9 30 p m hajdari was shot news reports saying he was killed at 10 00 p m are mistaken i was about four meters from hajdari when they killed him i saw the persons who fired the shots and saw them pull the triggers there were four assassins in the two cars
813888 the police blasted skenders car with gunfire and began searching for me but fortunately i had run in the opposite direction
813889 we will submit the concrete proposal of our project to the board of investment boi after completion of the feasibility study of the project by this year
813890 if the government provides us the same incentives what it promised to allow tata group we will successfully establish bigger steel projects than tatas and will be able to amass the necessary fund from both local and foreign sources
813891 it has made up its mind to start work on establishing the tk 2500 crore project in the port city as soon as possible as tatas scrapping of its bangladesh project brightened the market prospect of its project
813892 if we get green signal from the government about availability of gas we may start working on the project by january next year
813893 we submitted our plan even when the tatas project was in place now the government can consider the same benefit it offered to tata
813894 those who hold to the a mil position allegorize and do not take scripture literally or seriously
813895 your attitude is a determining factor in achieving success in life releasing your faith and staying in a state of expectation before god are the keys to seeing god move on your behalf the greatest desire of the father is for his children to be blessed part of being blessed is understanding the role you play in receiving that blessing you must maintain a positive attitude

813915 i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel not that there is another one but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of christ but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you let him be accursed as we have said before so now i say again if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received let him be accursed for am i now seeking the approval of man or of god or am i trying to please man if i were still trying to please man i would not be a servant of christ
813916 the gospel is the power of god for salvation to everyone who believes for in it the righteousness of god is revealed from faith for faith as it is written the righteous shall live by faith

813920 lucas who left the practice field at wofford college on friday with ice over his left eye has a broken nose fox said smith was kicked out of practice and sent back to charlotte
813921 the suspension will cost smith more than 205 000 a fraction of his base salary fox also seemed to issue a stern warning toward smith and his future actions

813923 mainly our production ranges will include the printing of bank cheques demand drafts payment orders certificates and mark sheets share certificates or any sort of security printing product
813924 all these security printing products will bear our companys hologram to ensure safety security and quality for our clients
813925 our company has already invested tk 1 30 billion and hopefully by 2010 our total amount of investment will stand at tk 7 80 billion
813926 while meeting the local demand for security printing we will also export our products to international market on a large scale
813927 almost all of our raw materials will be imported from abroad
813928 apart from training and employing a large number of local workers this venture would also benefit the country by saving large amount of foreign exchange that is now spent for maneuvering printing jobs from abroad
813929 i am sure if the government and the bangladesh bank allow us we can produce the best quality printing products to be used in passports and currencies and thus save more than tk 7 0 billion now spent annually on importing the security papers from foreign countries
813930 our company has a huge production capacity with 1 5 million per hour and definitely we are offering the ever best printing services to the clients
813931 we have a highly skilled and dedicated team of printing professionals to ensure quality services throughout the complete process and we guarantee efficient high volume high tech and cost effective services
813932 being one of the largest economies japanese entrepreneurs never compromise on quality and similarly i can guarantee you as far as our company products are concerned

813969 crds yield five to 10 times more than the average stock their payouts qualify for the low 15 tax rate they tack on an extra profit if the dollar continues to drop and they offer major capital gains potential to boot

814221 we really sat down to change quarkxpress and change the number of mouse clicks it takes to get things done

814224 using techniques normally associated with well heeled political campaigns the north shore barrington association of realtors nsbar has launched web sites sent out slick mailings placed automated telephone calls conducted opinion polls and used other tools to rally support for the groups position on issues loosely grouped under the umbrella of homeowners rights

814232 the government has not succeeded in tackling inequality and educational failure
814233 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
814234 david cameron has already said he cannot guarantee the future of emas under a future conservative government and this latest attempt by michael gove to undermine them suggests they have a secret plan to cut this vital support for students on low and middle incomes
814235 as an independent evaluation from the institute for fiscal studies showed earlier this year ema has been a real success with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to stay on in education at 16 as a direct result
814236 we will build on this success and from next month every young person on ema will get a firm guarantee of financial support if they go on to university
814237 children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
814238 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
814239 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
814240 however we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective and in consequence the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
814241 i think my overall reaction is that its really sad that in 2008 i have people watching every single move i make
814242 when theres a big game between the cubs and brewers going on its sad that thats what their focus is on
814243 i like this city the environment the energy in the fans i think that ill play here for the remainder of my career

814245 im making a distinction that i think is a legitimate distinction between casino gambling or other kinds of gambling in ohio and the lottery which is an activity that has been voted on by the people has been supported by the people of this state for a long time and this is an activity that is state controlled and state regulated

814251 is based on the ospd but includes the vulgar and offensive words removed from later editions of the ospd
814252 but if the blackletter rule that games are not copyrightable means anything it means that this similarity the two games produce the same gaming experience is not cognizable under copyright law
814253 the number values and amount of each letter in the set simply reflect the frequency of their use in english language words
814254 i write letters to my husband every day we dont have access to phones or email this time detailing what our daughter did that day so he will feel like hes part of her day to day life i take lots of photos of our daughter to send to him its difficult because at times it feels like our lives are on hold until he returns
814255 i have found it vital to have at least one regularly scheduled activity while my husband is gone it becomes something to look forward to each week which gives me little milestones along the way

814263 seemingly without provocation the video just does not tell us which will be a key question in litigation
814264 this is what i and others find so problematic with the supreme courts decision in scott v harris the high speed chase video case the majority too readily accepted that the video told the whole story for purposes of summary judgment not considering limits on what the video can accurately and fully show
814265 but im not expecting to win because i dont practice every day

814267 she was facing the reality of losing her identity as a professional golfer
814268 the only goal appropriate to the academy is the transmission and advancement of knowledge when teachers offer themselves as moralists political activists or agents of social change rather than as credentialed experts in a particular subject and the mthods used to analyze it they abdicate their true purpose those who do this will often invoke academic freedom but fish argues that academic freedom correctly understood is the freedom to do the academic job not the freedom to do any job that comes into the professors mind
814269 moral capacities or their absence have no relationship whatsoever to the reading of novels or the running of statistical programs or the execution of laboratory procedures
814270 anyone who asks for more than academics in a narrow sense has enlisted in the we are going to save the world army along with derek bok
814271 i snt the university primarily a place for the unfettered expression of ideas the answer is no the university is primarily a place for teaching and research the unfettered expression of ideas is a cornerstone of liberal democracy it is a prime political value it is not however an academic virtue and if we come to regard it as our primary responsibility we will default on the responsibilities assigned us and come to be what no one pays us to be political agents engaged in political advocacy
814272 if youre not in the pursuit of truth business you should not be in the university
814273 w hat about professional schools and professional training i f students at such schools are taught methods and techniques in the absence of any inquiry into their sources validity and philosophical underpinnings that professional school is not the location of any intellectual activity and is academic only in the sense that it is physically housed in a university
814274 the judgment of whether a policy is the right one for the country is not appropriate in the classroom where you are or should be more interested in the structure and history of ideas than in recommending them or dis recommending them to your students
814275 in the 1950s the legal and moral status of segregation was a live political question working its way through legislatures and courts which were and are the proper venues for adjudicating the issue faculty members were free to air their views in public forums and many did but those who used the classroom as a soapbox were co opting a space intended for other purposes
814276 a s for ethical judgment in general no doubt everything you encounter helps to shape it but reading novels by henry james is not a special key to achieving it and indeed and there are many examples of this in the world readers of henry james or sylvia plath or toni morrison can be as vile and as cruel and as treacherous as anyone else
814277 t here may be some views of the world and how one should live in it that cannot be fully and adequately stated in the language of conventional philosophical prose a style remarkably flat and lacking in wonder but only in language and in forms themselves more complex more allusive more attentive to particulars
814278 conception and form are bound together finding and shaping words is a matter of finding the appropriate and so to speak the honorable fit between conception and expression if the writing is well done a paraphrase in a very different form and style will not in general express the same conception
814279 the second claim is that certain truths about human life can only be fittingly and accurately state in the language and forms characteristic of the narrative artist
814280 when not ignoring it treating style as largely decorative as irrelevant to the stating of content and neutral among the contents that might be conveyed
814281 examine s the contribution made by certain works of literature to the exploration of some important questions about human beings and human life
814282 concerned with intentions and thoughts that are realized in the text and that may appropriately be seen in the text not with other thoughts and feelings the real life author and reader may find themselves having
814283 i am interested in all and only those thoughts feelings wishes movements and other processes that are actually there to be seen in the text
814284 no claim about novels in general far less about literature in general could possibly emerge from this book
814285 the ability to discern acutely and responsively the salient features of ones particular situation
814286 cultivating humanity a classical defense of reform in liberal education
814287 official priorities have been set yet but i believe ba corporate and commercial law will be on the list
814288 finally the most distinctive aspect of byu law school is the religious affiliation
814289 and no its not for everybody with its religious affiliation and fairly conservative faculty administration and student body
814290 we should be tolerant of views we disagree with and should be slow to judge things we dont understand
814291 on the other hand our common religious values allow me to interact with the law students outside of class in a manner that is often more direct and meaningful than was possible with students of a different religious heritage while i love my students at wisconsin vandy lewis amp clark etc the unique opportunities for mentoring that i have at byu are among the most important reasons that i am here rather than at another law school right now
814292 by the time 2l and 3l years roll around everyone pretty much knows everyones status for lack of a better word faculty and administration included
814293 i would also be surprised to hear that professor smith does not know where his closest mentees served their missions or which ward they attend or even their family history as it relates to the mormon church
814294 i guess there should be places for people who are really into religious homogeneity that homogeneity which i admit to finding a little creepy very likely explains a lot of the satisfaction based results reported above im sure regent law students are also highly satisfied with their educations its the rest of us who are not that said byu is a rigorous school that has quality students and faculty no doubt it just may not be a great model for anyone else
814295 theres not much we can learn from a religious law school like byu about educating diverse student bodies at mainstream law schools
814296 warmed over bien pensant liberalism that i see somewhat over simplistically as the result of the usual attempts to mix values and intellect at the top secular law schools
814297 how good are law schools that lack a shared sense of mission
814298 it was harder to go out with the mormon friend i felt bad drinking in front of him
814299 it didnt seem like there was any doubt it was going in
814300 i wish i wanted it as much as i used to but i dont
814301 ive been with her for 10 years a lot of wins she hit every green today it is the sign of a champion to come out when you dont have a chance of winning and play like that shes great nobodys done it better ill never forget this
814302 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away
814303 but i just dont have that when you have the mind of a champion and the mind of a competitor but then theres a few pieces missing thats hard to accept sometimes
814304 i came up 18 made the corner turn and there was a sign saying annika you will be missed
814305 i thought that was very special i waved to the guys they clapped and then i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause ive been out here for 15 years and ive experienced a lot of joy a few setbacks but overall its been great
814306 im going to miss it no doubt about it i love the majors i try to gear up for them and kind of be ready for them ive had happy tears there ive had unhappy tears this game and this championship just sucks everything out of you
814307 the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit that perfect 6 iron and make that putt
814308 republicans felt they got a lot of good press out of fridays revolt so they will be back at it again
814309 in a week where exxon mobil made the largest quarterly profits by a u s corporation republicans are staying in washington to argue that big oil deserves more taxpayer lands republicans must think big oil is
814310 the exclusion unconstitutional for two reasons the program expressly discriminates among religions without constitutional justification and its criteria for doing so involve unconstitutionally intrusive scrutiny of religious belief and practice
814311 younger people are kind of excited about being in the wilderness
814312 thats where the republicans are right now and its demoralizing for think tankers
814313 when theyre out of power they have to think in a clearer way
814314 is there anything more fun than sitting around growing your hair drinking a bud while listening to jethro tull and pondering how to change the balance of power in the search world and unseat google
814315 has decided to take the program named siskel amp ebert and then ebert amp roeper in a new direction i will no longer be associated with it
814316 it is this print corpus that will sustain mr eberts reputation as one of the few authentic giants in a field in which self importance frequently overshadows accomplishment
814317 i have the following complexes i will blame them on some feature of my history that has nothing to do with me personally and removes any guilt from my part and will assume that everyone who shares this history must also have the same complexes

814325 ones stated same gender attraction is not an honor code issue however the honor code requires all members of the university community to manifest a strict commitment to the law of chastity homosexual behavior and or advocacy of homosexual behavior are inappropriate and violate the honor code homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings advocacy includes seeking to influence others to engage in homosexual behavior or promoting homosexual relations as being morally acceptable violations of the honor code may result in actions up to and including separation from the university

814330 im elite youre not so im necessarily better smarter sharper than you
814331 superstars at elite colleges and universities theoretical bent not sure whether they want to practice law but might for a while might well want to be a law professor someday gee it would be great to clerk on the supreme court
814332 the true test that were equals is when i can call you my colleague
814333 even if say michigans faculty were a lot better and more accessible than yales yale would still be a better place to go for academia supreme court clerkships because its a better costly signal of intelligence
814334 3 is it time for a real lrw class why do 1ls at stanford get feedback from talented lawyers on their writing a skill legal employers care a lot about while we get such feedback from 3ls who are smart and nice but themselves undereducated in lrw
814335 id love for you to join the effort and help improve the way we measure schools relative ability to educate lawyers
814336 as heidi k points out students arrive at yls well aware of how they do things and generally end up much more dissatisfied than those at peer institutions
814337 is the deadline to seek rehearing in kennedy v louisiana 07 343 though there has been no indication the state of louisiana will seek rehearing
814338 i am hoping that governor jindal will stay true to his word and have his state at least ask the justices for rehearing in
814339 i am not sure that the justices will or even should grant rehearing in kennedy but i am sure that there are lots of justifications for louisiana filing a rehearing petition
814340 jindal decides the states resources are more efficiently spent on continuing to bring child rape death penalty cases in defiance of the supreme court rather than spending thousands on a potentially nearly assuredly futile petition

814359 that their ads use against democrats and anyone who does not support their upper class agenda
814360 where law breakers who serve the interests of the corporate class can snub our laws while the bleeding hearts of the republican party and their fellow travelers in the libertarian party do nothing and even condone their actions

814371 great old broads with lifetimes of adventures and experiences to draw from bring a broader perspective and valuable insights to wilderness discussions than other environmental organizations with more youthful memberships are able to do great old broads are uniquely qualified to speak up for the lands and to protect what we have learned is valuable and important we are prepared to alleviate the destruction to wilderness and we are optimistic that we will make a difference
814372 being a slow food member is a self fulfilling prophecy because as the saying goes if we are what we eat who wants to be fast cheap and easy
814373 not usually because people enter these communities with the mindsets and values of the individualistic and materialist society that nurtured them but like the utopias that have dotted the landscape of history i think those in faith based retirement communities are more likely to create genuine community feeling
814374 this is america there is very little environmental anger and frustration to work with i hope we can develop some anger and frustration as our movement matures
814375 the short future ahead will firstly be filled with finishing writing a book on the need to revise the enlightenment view of human nature as autonomous rational materialistic and primarily self interested

814391 for years and years people have wondered what the clone wars were
814392 the live action movies were really centered on the skywalker family and weve never gotten to see the full breadth of the conflict
814393 we may be dealing with a small window of time but the scope of war particularly a galactic war is pretty expansive
814394 theres a lot going on heroes villains intrigue adventure its all part of the story we know but its always been in the background until now
814395 a war by nature is a patchwork of untold stories
814396 whats fascinating to me is that there are people motivating these far reaching events and that those individuals are so often overshadowed by the big picture by the events themselves we know what happens to the galaxy but we dont know exactly how it all came to pass these are the stories behind the story
814397 theres one thing we knew we had to deliver above all else a star wars movie

814411 if dyslexia really exists then surely it is quite reasonable for the authorities to forbid sufferers from practising as doctors where a written mistake in a prescription or a misreading of a dose could be disastrous such discrimination like a lot of other discrimination is not only reasonable but urgently necessary
814412 i dont want to be treated by a dyslexic doctor
814413 forgive me ms gadian but youre missing the point youre not being discriminated against youre being weeded out its quite deliberate if you cant read or write sufficiently well to pass a multiple choice test you shouldnt be a doctor
814414 you cant tell me that our appeal and calls for revision of the law had no meaning at all
814415 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
814416 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
814417 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
814418 in the fifth inning and sixth inning i got the ball up a little bit
814419 they made me pay they put some good swings on the ball
814420 i dont want to appear self righteous but i do want to make it clear that thats the way i view it
814421 it used to be very uncommon that you would have a claim where someone would die while their appeal was pending
814422 unfortunately that is becoming much more common people are dying from what they are complaining of
814423 its something weve all paid into so it should be there if you are in need of it
814424 the system you have to work with is a nightmare
814425 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
814426 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
814427 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play now that were going to play with him hell make us better and well make him better
814428 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail pulling issue for us
814429 they gave me a lot of good pitches to hit and i drove it
814430 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
814431 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
814432 that just puts it in perspective there is a lot of excitement going on right now with the fans
814433 i didnt have control and when i got it in the zone they hit it hard
814434 i didnt do my job today but ill go out there again in five days and do my job
814435 we all agree with the fundamental need to deal with this problem and i know canada is prepared to step up and be part of a solution
814436 does it necessarily mean going out burning crops or whatever the latest technique is im not sure about that
814437 this myth of the poor farmer has been used as an excuse to avoid eradication
814438 if you look at the data it is not the poor farmers in afghanistan who are growing the poppy
814439 the poor farmers have taken advantage of the alternative crop programs weve offered and turned away from poppy the poorest parts of afghanistan do not cultivate poppy but the rich parts of kandahar the helmand valley a fertile part of afghanistan thats where all of the opium is being cultivated
814440 well have to do something weve got two away at the olympics americans maurice edu and marvell wynne danny dichio who is out with a concussion we dont know when he is coming back and defender todd dunivant has been taken off the roster because of a long term ankle injury we might have to get assistant coach and former canadian national team member nick dasovic to put boots on
814441 you guys asking the questions because you know there is a problem with it if you guys are asking us the questions about refereeing and fans asking about refereeing maybe there is a problem i think everybody else that watches the game knows what is going on
814442 ive never ever in my life not shook an officials hand
814443 people come here to watch the referee so ask him
814444 the cards okay but whys one not given to ricchetti as well
814445 with two weeks off and then playing here two days after arriving with turf its going to happen to you i half expected but i really hoped it didnt happen on the shot because i thought it had a really good chance
814446 it feels great to walk out of here with a win
814447 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
814448 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
814449 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
814450 been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to any mental institution
814451 hiding it from your co workers that would have been very very difficult
814452 universities are pretty sloppy its an academic setting not a security setting
814453 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
814454 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
814455 have access to some of the most lethal substances imaginable
814456 one of the complaints by people who work in safety and security is they cant get the time of day from people running the labs
814457 are viewed as deeply offensive by a lot of scientists as if their patriotism is being questioned
814458 though several agencies have a need to know no one agency knows the number and location of these labs in the united states
814459 this is a result of many years of frustration in trying to move forward with trying to provide our patients with treatment options access to innovative surgeries access to clinical trials
814460 as more research becomes available across the country our colleagues moved forward but you know were just having these increasing frustrations with getting these new treatment options off the ground in newfoundland
814461 these people are going through a very vulnerable time in their lives they need their support system we certainly want these patients to be dealt with on home territory thats certainly the most important thing for them
814462 to recruit to an area where these specialists are among the lowest paid in canada is going to be very difficult under those circumstances
814463 certainly its part of our frustration its not our primary frustration but it certainly doesnt make us feel any better being the lowest paid physicians of our group in the country its just another added low
814464 theyre already a very vulnerable population it was an extremely difficult decision for us to come to and i really hope that we can get it resolved
814465 but we havent decided yet if we will include the plants in the sale or just the contracts but were more inclined to go for the ownership approach
814466 we call for immediate halting of all incidents in the enduring gaza strip and release all the abducted supporters without any condition or restriction
814467 while the board sees some valid points raised by ue the board also saw the human error in the game
814468 theres always that possibility of officials committing human error thats normal officials are not infallible
814469 there was a voting im not at liberty to reveal how the voting went but it was a majority
814470 were disappointed but we have to abide by the boards decision
814471 but we still believe that a technical error happened during the game and it shouldve been corrected they said it did not affect the outcome of the game but in a close game like that every basket counted
814472 the preparation is completed and based on what i see we can win medals in taekwondo and boxing
814473 we have prepared him to last until the finals so we simulated five fighting days
814474 the crazy thing is that my minds made up so let the music play
814475 forgiving us those things of which our conscience is afraid
814476 giving us those good things we are not worthy to ask
814477 it was a little difficult at first but we were cool with it kevin moved on and so have we were comfortable with what we do as four and its still just as strong
814478 i think the most challenging part was kind of figuring out who the new backstreet boys are because that was an issue when kevin had left the group
814479 i think we kind of doubted ourselves at certain times but once we realized we were confident i think that it turned out to be really good and were excited
814480 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
814481 scheduled the first tuesday of the month sidewalk salons provide an opportunity for birminghams filmmaking community to meet greet listen and discuss guest speakers and topics provide a focus to each meeting

814484 an analysis of hacker attacks on online servers in january by security consultancy mi2g found that linux servers were the most frequently violated accounting for 13 654 successful attacks or 80 per cent of the survey total
814485 in a similar analysis last year windows proved far more vulnerable with 51 per cent of successful attacks on government servers made on some version of the microsoft operating system
814486 the poll said 25 percent of companies fired a worker for violating e mail policies up from 2 percent last year
814487 about 0 5 percent of companies said instant messages have been subpoenaed
814488 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
814489 women are involved in almost 75 percent of all electronics purchases
814490 women actually spent more on technology last year than men according to the consumer electronics association
814491 forty percent of the women said they were treated better when accompanied by a man
814492 a meager 1 percent of women surveyed thought manufacturers had them in mind when creating products according to the report released at last weeks consumer electronics show
814493 uh you just put them there ya know when you call getdataset or whatever
814494 i dont think its nothing i need to be concerned or worried about
814495 omg i cant believe i forgot to mail that out ill get it out in tomorrows mail
814496 nearly 40 percent of respondents state that less than five percent of their servers host virtualisation today by 2010 70 percent of organisations believe that over 50 percent of all new servers deployed will host virtualisation
814497 with future goals for virtualisation increasing in complexity in addition to a still untapped market for virtualising production applications plus well rated credible alternatives recently being introduced to the space there is a strong possibility that vmwares dominance will come under attack despite current customer loyalty
814498 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814499 a person includes any human from the time of fertilization
814500 we are honored to have received these endorsements from such respected physicians
814501 science clearly proves that life begins at the time of fertilization we are secure in the fact that we have science and reason on our side and we are pleased to have the medical community supporting our efforts
814502 be it enacted by the people of the state of colorado the terms person or persons shall include any human being from the moment of fertilization
814503 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814504 we have just one thing to say to tiller today and that is see you in court
814505 todays ruling by judge owens vindicates our efforts to bring tiller to justice all along we knew that it wasnt the law that was faulty but it was tillers interpretation of the law that was faulty this gives us a glimmer of hope that we could eventually see some shred of justice
814506 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814507 terminating the life of a whole separate unique living human be
814508 terminating the life of a whole separate unique living human being
814509 existing constitutional rights with regards to that relationship will be terminated
814510 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814511 im appalled that an officer of the law would be involved in that
814512 we are gratified that osathanondh will have to account for lauras death in a court of law it is not enough that he can no longer practice medicine he must be held legally responsible for his crimes that resulted in the death of this young woman
814513 only then can we say that some small measure of justice has been served
814514 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814515 right now at this moment in history the one thing that in the united states of america every citizen can impact is the destiny of our nation
814516 and that is through the presidential race the next president is likely going to place two supreme court justices
814517 the enduring legacy of the presidency is in fact the justices that they leave a lot of people didnt like george bushs position but national right to life supported bush he was committed to justices which would uphold the constitution as written and by extension overturn roe and he actually kept those promises in the current situation john mccain has said the same thing
814518 on the other side we have an individual who not merely is a pro abort but probably the most pro abortion candidate for president that weve seen as a nation
814519 when he spoke to planned parenthood promised that his first official act would be to sign foca into law
814520 im surprised to hear myself say it that obama is more pro abortion because of our experience with the clintons
814521 in a similar vein she was willing to temper her position to be seen as a counterpoint to obama she was willing to give him the most radical elements of society
814522 it is amazing to see that there would be somebody farther left on this issue than the clilntons but we see that in barak obama i fear for our nation should he become president
814523 not only will it affect our nation but also the world because of the incredible influence that the united states government has on the united nations
814524 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814525 strict well defined exception for the health of the mother
814526 i dont think that mental distress qualifies as health of the mother i think it has to be a serious physical issue that arises in pregnancy where there are real significant problems to the mother carrying that child to term
814527 given the choice having a baby is a more moral choice than abortion
814528 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
814529 if the motor industry is going to survive beyond the next few years we are going to have to work hard to attract future generations of drivers people who currently find it difficult to love the car
814530 mixim can be seen as more than a show car its a serious statement of intent
814531 mixim should tick all the right boxes as far as the younger generation is concerned it is powered by an advanced powerful yet environmentally friendly electric motor and is compact enough to fit into their urban world
814532 this is the vision at the very heart of our brand
814533 havent you sometimes seen a cloud that looked like a centaur or a leopard perhaps or a wolf or a bull
814534 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
814535 fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life son
814536 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
814537 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
814538 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
814539 were fighting to free our country we are not a threat to the world
814540 becoming a sort of surreal hunting estate in which the u s and nato breed the very terrorists they then track down
814541 colorful little flags identify the nato troops presence throughout the country
814542 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
814543 well if you wont get on the bus then youre refusing
814544 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
814545 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
814546 if you could reduce these sensational attacks further i think you are almost approaching a level of normal or latent violence
814547 the fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two and a half months indicates there is a degree of durability
814548 al qaeda although significantly degraded still can strap a suicide vest on an individual and push him or her into a crowd of iraqis
814549 what weve got to do of course is figure out how to keep it there while over time further reducing our forces and trying to further degrade the networks that carry out the sensational attacks
814550 certainly there have been very tough days and tough reversals
814551 im pretty confident that we can find a political solution to this problem
814552 if the decision of the military and the bush cheney government is that theyll be prosecuted then they ought to be welcome here
814553 they drove it into my head that i would be doing so much to help building power plants and schools and handing out school supplies to kids
814554 as soon as anyone would mess with it you were supposed to lay waste to them
814555 i completely disagreed with that tactic i cant see how thats helping anyone whatsoever
814556 i thought people needed to be free there but when i went there it was all about captures and kills and it felt like we messed things up over there
814557 this is not vietnam at that time you could walk in set your bags down and stay
814558 the vast majority of the soldiers who desert have been on active duty for less than six months and the reasons for deserting typically cited are personal problems money problems things like that
814559 i dont know anybody who supports whats going on in iraq
814560 i took pictures of something they didnt like and they removed me deciding what i can and cannot document i dont see a clearer definition of censorship
814561 specifically mr miller provided our enemy with an after action report on the effectiveness of their attack and on the response procedures of u s and iraqi forces
814562 i dont think the uniformed military has really bought into the whole embed program
814563 during the invasion it got a lot of whoopee were kicking their butts type of tv coverage
814564 in disembedding mr miller the marines are using a catch all phrase which could be applied to just about anything a journalist does
814565 he said it was unsafe i know its unsafe theres a war going on it was unsafe when i got to iraq in 2003 but the military did not stop us from working now they are stopping us from working
814566 we were within hours of basra when they told me i had to go back i was told that general kelly did not want any western eyes down there
814567 there is leeway for commanders to make judgment calls which is part of what commanders do
814568 mr millers complete lack of respect to these marines their friends and families is shameful
814569 how do we explain to their children or families these disturbing pictures just days after it happened
814570 do you have to have the light on to play your ds you big dweeb
814571 do you have to have the light on to be a bish
814572 the council wishes you to come to the hall master archivist
814573 kaemenes this is good news come let us hurry to hear what hes learned
814574 now arimedos it is true that kaemenes has been returned to us
814575 he has taken no physical injury that we can detect nor is he ill in any way we know how to treat the only way i can put it is that his mind is somehow broken the healers are trying but they dont know if there is anything they can do for him
814576 he was found wandering to the south of the desert of the marid dressed in rags he could not or would not give his name or any other information all he did was babble about someone whispering to him somehow he still retained his journal and notes and so the hunters who found him discovered that he had come from ameleus one of the hunters bayard redbeard by name accompanied him on the journey and told us how kaemenes was found redbeard was rewarded for the aid he gave one of ours and is staying in the village since i know you will wish to speak to him
814577 we thought this ourselves and that you would be the logical choice since you both researched in the same field his notes and his journal have already been sent to your study
814578 we have other itinerants out there and some of them might run into something like these whisperers that kaemenes rants about we wish you to make this your top priority
814579 neener neener i had yummy crepes and you had nasty corn flakes
814580 the important thing for the fed right now is to skate through this delicate period
814581 chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
814582 some consent forms were well done but others did not provide enough information and detail to count as informed consent
814583 its not that they are unacceptable consent forms theyre just acceptable for only certain kinds of research
814584 without looking at the original consent forms i dont think you can say you can use them for any type of research
814585 all human stem cell research will need to be reviewed and approved by the committee and that will include how cells were obtained and if the consent was adequate
814586 an important step for us is to take into account these findings
814587 but we havent done that as a group and we havent reached a decision on these cell lines
814588 required the deriver or provider of each candidate cell line to provide written assurance that all the criteria set forth by the president had been fulfilled including the specified components of the informed consent process
814589 it doesnt make sense to fund or not fund research just because of when a stem cell line was derived
814590 its preferable to use cell lines that have even better consent than ones used on the bush approved registry
814591 points to the fact that this policy is not tenable anymore
814592 i think pastor so and so said we would break here for some announcements and welcome time

814596 sekiranya kamu tidak berperang nescaya kamu akan dikurniakan azab yang pedih dan dia menggantikan kamu dengan kaum yang lain
814597 kemungkinan azab itu diturunkan daripada allah dan kemungkinan azab itu dengan tangan manusia sendiri apabila manusia meninggalkan jihad di jalan allah kemungkinan allah akan menguji mereka dengan menjadikan permusuhan dikalangan mereka sehingga mereka terjerumus kedalam fitnah sebagaimana yang berlaku kerana manusia apabila sibuk dengan berjihad di jalan allah allah akan menyatukan di antara hati hati mereka dan membina kasih sayang antara mereka dan dijadikan kepedihan kepada musuh allah dan musuh mereka apabila mereka tidak berangkat ke jalan allah allah akan mengazab mereka dengan menjadikan mereka berpecah belah dan bermusuhan sesama sendiri

814600 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
814601 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
814602 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
814603 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
814604 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
814605 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
814606 one for the money two for the show three to get ready and four to go
814607 hey will i know what you are going to say and i agree i hate bad service
814608 what is so bad about this what can he possibly find to complain about now

814618 i would really like to be at the surface right now
814619 where the rule of law not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of nations
814620 the energy of sketches would start dying halfway through and eventually end on a really weird line
814621 legume intake is associated with a moderate reduction in prostate cancer risk
814622 no association between legumes or protein intake and prostate cancer mortality
814623 i was excited to have avocet travel and clarence o smith associated with bella italia a travel club that is a celebration of black women and sisterhood
814624 to have a man that was once connected to a wonderful magazine like essence to administer our tour seemed like a perfect union
814625 i was also excited that we were supporting an african american business i never dreamt that today myself and 59 other black women who have worked so hard to scrape up money to pay for this tour would have all our hopes and dreams for the vacation of a lifetime threatened because avocet spent the money that was not theirs to spend not only was our money spent but also the monies earmarked for a fund to help send foster children and their mentors on international tours through the icare foundation
814626 this is about so much more than the tour this is about devastating and denying these women the opportunity to join me on this traveling sisterhood sojourn
814627 one woman told me that her father gave her this trip on his deathbed he thanked her for being a wonderful daughter and told her to go to italy enjoy herself and be sure she walked the streets of water she didnt know what that meant but had planned to find out another woman developed a brain tumor after she paid and needs to get her money back so she can support herself after the surgery she has yet to get a refund from avocet that was requested three months ago this is bigger than me it is an impediment in peoples lives i wanted to believe in mr smith and avocet and what they represented but i cannot

814697 we need to raise the standard of living of our poor unemployed and minorities for example we have an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in our country who need our help along with millions of unemployed minorities stock market windfall profits taxes could go a long way to guarantee these people the standard of living they would like to have as americans

814752 ive been thinking about the kingdom and experiencing god more
814753 devo votare d p perch un obbligo mi ha trovato il lavoro
814754 i think ive thrown enough good games during that stretch to not reinvent the wheel
814755 there is struggling there is not feeling comfortable and theres not winning those are totally different things
814756 i felt good about how i was throwing the ball i didnt win some games you would normally win
814757 greg bases a lot of his work on his performance and he was throwing the ball well
814758 because of his experience his head he might not let that stretch affect him like a younger pitcher would he kept doing the same things every five days
814759 he was really pounding the zone and throwing strikes it was fun to watch
814760 i was just trying to find the strike zone and i ended up throwing it up and away it was a pitch that a pitcher can handle
814761 when he gets an rbi on top of that its hard to beat him
814762 hes had our number and today he did it again
814763 i believe that that domain knowledge should be a corequisite not prerequisite for effective use of domain knowledge
814764 the iphone 3g has been the fastest selling phone ever in the u k but it is too expensive to be a realistic proposition in the pay as you go market

814770 sleep disordered breathing and mortality eighteen year follow up of the wisconsin sleep cohort
814771 in civilized life it has at last become possible for large numbers of people to pass from the cradle to the grave without ever having had a pang of genuine fear many of us need an attack of mental disease to teach us the meaning of the word
814772 everyone can testify that the psychical state called fear consists of mental representations of certain painful results
814773 as a matter of fact i have pain but i am earnestly striving to ignore it and to cultivate thought health so that the cause of pain may be removed
814774 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad
814775 theres just no way to describe it urine and feces dog cat and human excrement smeared on the walls mashed into the carpet everything dank and rotting
814776 it sounded like you were walking on eggshells you couldnt take a step without crunching german cockroaches
814777 they were in the lights in the furniture even inside the freezer the freezer
814778 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
814779 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
814780 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg
814781 but the only ones i found were covered in maggots and roaches
814782 the mothers statement was im doing the best i can
814783 if this child doesnt get to a hospital shes not going to make it
814784 the child will be disabled for the rest of her life
814785 there was no light in her eye no response or recognition we saw a little girl who didnt even respond to hugs or affection even a child with the most severe autism responds to those
814786 in the first five years of life 85 percent of the brain is developed
814787 those early relationships more than anything else help wire the brain and provide children with the experience to trust to develop language to communicate they need that system to relate to the world
814788 its mind boggling that in the 21st century we can still have a child whos just left in a room like a gerbil
814789 no food no one talking to her or reading her a story she cant even use her hands how could this child be so invisible
814790 my hope was that she would be able to sleep through the night to be out of diapers and to feed herself
814791 we were so distraught over her condition we agonized over what to do
814792 her behavior was different than any child id ever seen
814793 if you put food anywhere near her shed grab it
814794 she had a lot of episodes of great agitation yelling flailing her arms rolling into a fetal position shed curl up in a closet just to be away from everyone she didnt know how to climb a slide or swing on a swing she didnt want to be touched
814795 in my entire career with the child welfare system i dont ever remember a child like danielle
814796 it makes you think about what does quality of life mean whats the best we can hope for her after all shes been through is it just being safe
814797 that one is dangerous she cant be with other children
814798 i guess she wanted to make sure the food was still there
814799 okay lets put your shoes on do you need to go potty again
814800 i know my son will never stand on his own will never be able to climb onto a horse you have no idea what your daughter might be able to do
814801 id like her to at least be able to master a sound board so she can communicate her choices even if she never finds her voice
814802 i think she understands most of what we say its just that she doesnt always know how to or want to react
814803 i drive her around in my jeep and she honks the horn
814804 you got your wormie you ready to go to sleep
814805 thats okay too for me its all about getting the kisses and the hugs
814806 left unattended for days with a retarded older brother never seen wearing anything but a diaper
814807 the home is filthy there are clothes everywhere there are feces on the childs seat and the counter is covered with trash
814808 is still wearing a diaper and drinking from a baby bottle on going situation worse since last august mom leaves grant and danielle at home for several days in a row while she goes to work and spends the night with a new paramour danielle is never seen outside the home
814809 its not automatic that because the home is dirty wed remove the child
814810 and what they found in 2002 was not like the scene they walked into in 2005
814811 im concerned though that no effort was made to interview the child
814812 if you have a 4 year old who is unable to speak that would raise a red flag to me
814813 im not going to tell you this was okay i dont know how it could have happened
814814 i tried to potty train her she wouldnt train i tried to get her into schools no one would take her
814815 was that she didnt speak much she talked in a soft tone shed say lets go eat but no one could hear her except me
814816 miss polly had a dolly she was sick sick sick
814817 id been sick and it got away from me but i never knew a dirty house was against the law
814818 he said she was starving i told him me and my sisters were all skinny till we were 13
814819 she tended to blame her difficulties on circumstances while rationalizing her own actions
814820 is more concerned with herself than most other adults and this could lead her to neglect paying adequate attention to people around her
814821 they say i made her autistic but how do you make a kid autistic they say i didnt put clothes on her but she just tore them off
814822 verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
814823 give me a revelation show me what to do cause ive been trying to find my way i havent got a clue tell me should i stay here or do i need to move give me a revelation ive got nothing without you ive got nothing without you
814824 we have held talks about the nano being marketed in markets where fiat has already a strong presence i am open to consider a partnership

814826 the collingwood football club can confirm heath shaw was in a minor car accident when the car he was driving made contact with a stationary vehicle last night
814827 heath was not injured however police later charged him with drink driving
814828 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
814829 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
814830 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
814831 im a 25 year veteran of the u s congress and ive never seen anything like this
814832 t he combination of intermarriage among professionals and a higher divorce rate among the less educated
814833 a europe like class structure in which the upper middle class particularly in the tech and financial services industries lives segregated from ordinary americans
814834 illegal immigration and the flow of servants it provides has in a sense reconciled upper middle class feminism with the family

814837 i love you and im married to you but just in case something happens to us ive got my own account to depend on

814839 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
814840 in that situation most of the pitchers dont throw me inside but sliders away if he would have hit me with the first pitch i would have went to first base but three times were inside it seemed so obvious to me i just do what i needed to do
814841 y no hall cosa en que poner los ojos que no fuese recuerdo de la muerte
814842 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
814843 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
814844 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
814845 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
814846 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
814847 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
814848 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
814849 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
814850 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
814851 it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
814852 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
814853 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
814854 when it was just wet everybodys deal went fine competitors and our stuff alike
814855 i think it was just making sure that the standing water was gone there were some areas that the drainage didnt keep up with the precipitation
814856 we have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
814857 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain
814858 i couldnt see 5 feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution
814859 when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
814860 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
814861 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
814862 i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it
814863 it felt really slow and the car was slipping around
814864 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept on the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important
814865 as old as they are theyre a little hard so there was zero grip out there
814866 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
814867 we just did the best we could with what we had to work with
814868 it was a learning experience nascar did what it had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
814869 well take the input from the teams that were there and see if theres something else that we could do that we dont know we needed to do
814870 a packet of tasty treats and somebody to share it with

814908 the truth about 9 11 massive family gaggles bursting at the seams with turkish flags and sundry accessories and even an enterprising group of chalk artists sketching the word obama on the ground in american colours a particularly complicated task which wasnt exactly helped by the searing heat and overpowering smell generated by the regiment of 1001 kebab vans parked in greasy multitudes wherever there was any space left over
814909 what i have tried to find out is why these militant uprisings are occurring now throughout the world and in virtually every religious tradition and i have wanted to know what religion has to do with it my conclusion is that these incidents of religious violence are not really about religion i do not think that islam is any different from any other religious tradition with regard to violence all religious faiths can be used to promote political causes and justify violent acts i also do not think that there is a new mutation of religion that has infected the worlds cultures it would be mistaken to assume that religion has suddenly gone bad in the first decade of the 21st century rather it seems to me radical religious ideologies have become the vehicles for a variety of rebellions against secular authority that are linked with non religious issues a myriad of social cultural and political grievances

814911 in a global world it is hard to say where particular regions begin and end
814912 rapid internet communication allows members of dispersed ethnic and religious communities to maintain a close association

815216 we are absolutely delighted at the release of slim boukhdir like mohammed abbu before him he should never have been in prison in the first place
815217 he was deprived of his freedom for 238 days and treated like a common criminal simply for constantly exposing the abuses of power we would like to see the decision of the tunisian authorities to free him as evidence of their goodwill
815218 the tunisian state must put an end to the harassment of independent journalists and their families and to seizures of the opposition and foreign press the authorities should also allow free access to the internet so as to create a space for freedom and to ensure free expression in tunisia

815221 my release from jail is a victory for freedom and independent journalism the tunisian regime managed through imprisonment to deprive me of the right to freedom of movement and to do my job while being among my loved ones but it totally failed to break my will and determination to carry on with independent and ethical journalism
815222 its shameful and degrading for the whole country to jail journalists for doing their job
815223 boukhdhirs trial is one of those unfair trials that the tunisian regime is accustomed to staging in order to punish independent journalists and human rights activists
815224 state institutions such as the security apparatus justice system and media are mobilised to make people believe that freedom activists in tunisia are common law criminals we need to put an end to this policy

815238 etsy is the first thing you run to in the moring and the last thing you see at night
815239 ok this is a true story last week i threw my back out and was in bed flat on my back for 2 days it hurt to even breath my husband asked me if there was anything he could get me and with so much agony in my voice i said just my laptop he rolled his eyes and said you have issues
815240 yes my home page is etsy com also i have dreams about etsy regularly one dream was you could see who was looking at your items ive had other dreams and awoke thinking did that really happen
815241 you know youre addicted when you have nightmares that you have shipped the wrong items to folks only to wake up in the middle of the night and check your inventory
815242 when your in church the whole time you pray that by the time you get home youve made a sale
815243 some of them really work and some of them work better
815244 theres something about that chemistry between jon and garfield that makes it work absolutely perfect
815245 all in jons imagination anyway which is pretty weird and creepy
815246 a true masterpiece in how the presence of garfield was subtle to begin with and how the omission truly changes the meaning of the strip in a profound way

815248 we were able to be a bit more physical today in that we had some pads on
815249 we had a passing drill in the middle of practice and on the first play of that drill you could see a burst of white the defense wears white jerseys rush to the ball that was good too see it was the first real team situation we had and it is evident we have a chance to have some speed on defense this year
815250 matt sanders showed me some toughness and aggressiveness on sunday he was involved in a cross over drill against the number one defense and showed some real strength jamie harper showed me he can help us in a number of ways but he impressed me the most in terms of pass protection stanley hunter also was a standout in many of the drills on sunday and will help us on defense

815256 george must know since hes the country boy and hunter
815257 thats hard to answer because some team members clearly love their jobs more than others
815258 her hair was the longest and strangest mrs miller had ever seen absolutely silver white like an albinos it flowed waistlength in smooth loose lines she was thin and fragilely constructed there was a simple elegance in the way she stood with her thumbs in the pockets of a tailored plum velvet coat
815259 your mother must be insane to let a child like you wander around at all hours of the night and in such ridiculous clothes she must be out of her mind
815260 it came to mrs miller there was no one to whom she might turn she was alone a fact that had not been among her thoughts for a long time its sheer emphasis was stunning
815261 we believed in slavery for 18 and a half centuries before we came to know gods will for us with respect to people of colour
815262 it has been more painful than i thought it might be
815263 ive felt the exclusion profoundly i understand thats just the way it has to be but its a very odd and difficult feeling to have been separated from your own house of bishops by an external force
815264 as a constant and steady reminder that every bishop in the anglican communion has gay and lesbian people in their diocese whether they know it or not whether they know who they are or not whether it homosexuality is legal or not
815265 i dont consider them enemies at all and its no surprise to me that people who live in contexts very different from our own in the united states see this problem very differently
815266 its no surprise that many of these bishops and people in these countries where homosexuality is publishable sometimes by imprisonment have not had the experience we have had in the american church which is of faithful lesbian and gay people in the pews making themselves known to us and our having to grapple with that issue
815267 that doesnt mean i dont believe we shouldnt be changing those attitudes
815268 resist the push by those who are not here to try and settle this once and for all because in the end i think we will come to regret our rejection of gay and lesbian people the way we have come to regret our support for slavery and our virtual rejection of women
815269 the beauty of anglicanism is that it has been a big umbrella under which we can disagree about many things so long as we agree on the essentials
815270 i would plead for a continuation of that great tradition in which we hold together and we continue to be the church despite our differences on this issue because i dont think it rises to the level of being an essential
815271 you dont hear anyone on the side of those who would argue for greater inclusion of gay and lesbian people argue that anyone else has to leave no one is saying that the conservatives within the communion should leave because they dont understand the will of god
815272 that is what you hear coming from the other side and the difficulty of course is that you cant make anyone stay i would make a plea for our holding together while we live in this tension for a while
815273 we have no parishes threatening to break away i might even say its the one diocese in the whole of the anglican communion that doesnt deal with this issue at all
815274 i will be so glad to return home and not have to talk about being gay or gay and lesbian issues
815275 because mercifully in my own diocese im just the bishop im not the gay bishop
815276 though we do not share a faith we surely share a fate
815277 whatever our faith or lack of faith hunger still hurts disease still strikes poverty still disfigures and hate still kills
815278 if there is only competition and not co operation if there is only the state and the market and no covenantal relationships society will not survive
815279 what is the face religion all too often shows to the world conflict between faiths and sometimes within faiths
815280 your ability to hold together in a world driving us apart is your unique contribution
815281 the hardest thing in the world is to hold the adherents of a faith together the anglican communion has held together quite different strands of christian theology and practice more graciously and successfully than any other religion i know
815282 we may have forgotten this but for a thousand years between the first crusade and the holocaust the word christian struck fear into jewish hearts
815283 think only of the words the jewish encounter with christianity added to the vocabulary of human pain blood libel book burnings disputations forced conversions inquisition auto da fe public executions expulsion ghetto and pogrom
815284 and since then jews and christians have done more to mend their relationship than any other two religions on earth
815285 but now it is high on the agenda of virtually every bishop in the world
815286 we can play our part in being the glue that holds society together for the common good
815287 the dynamic of interfaith dialogue differs when muslims are in a minority and when they are in a majority
815288 dialogue is for us a daily business it is a dialogue of life
815289 dialogue has also helped us to help other people especially in transforming the society and we do it through education through health care and through programmes of poverty alleviation irrespective of creed caste or colour
815290 its being honest about who we are and where weve come from
815291 theres a sunrise every morning that you miss cause youre asleep theres a sunset every evening you miss in your car leaving to wherever it is that youre going youre not pulled but led

815294 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
815295 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
815296 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
815297 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
815298 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
815299 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
815300 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
815301 i feel adebayor felt people questioned his commitment a little bit and the best way to give an answer is always on the pitch
815302 you play well and show you are ready to fight for your shirt and your team he does that he is a man with character
815303 you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly their frustration you have to show it with performances in this job
815304 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
815305 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances his first touch his much better and he moves the ball quicker his peneration and final ball is better
815306 the quality is there i dont look too much at his age just what he is doing on the pitch and at the moment the quality is good
815307 perhaps people will stop saying i dont produce english players now
815308 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players but it is better i dont speak about names
815309 i dont know if barry will leave aston villa at the moment i am not on this case
815310 if we sign a player we will tell you but we are not close at the moment
815311 we are all really shocked about the injury its very difficult he has a lot of pain they have to do some tests but it doesnt look good
815312 on a day like this it was the last thing we wanted we can lose the game but not like that with that toughness these games are not really friendly there is a lot of prestuge at stake
815313 it feels like it has been a lifetime coming it has been a dream of mine since i was about 12
815314 brian was putting the heat on and i was feeling it i was just gutting it out
815315 i didnt have much in the tank it was all i had im pretty spent right now

815322 by my calculations that makes 33 97 million men and women sons and lovers kids and grandparents accountants and circus performers and sex workers with hiv worldwide so were missing nearly a million
815323 the people living with hiv at the end of 2007 should be those who were living with hiv at the end of 2006 33 27 million plus those who got infected in 2007 2 7 million if you take the new figures minus the people who died 2 0 million

815411 vietnams illegal trade in wildlife continues unabated and affects neighboring countries
815412 hanoi is the cultural and political center of vietnam where wildlife protection and conservation policies are issued and implemented
815413 this suggests that the gap between policies and implementation of wildlife protection is still big
815414 many high profile animals of global conservation concern such as tigers bears or rhinos can still be bought on the market provided prior notice is given and that the price negotiated is high enough

815440 its clearly a moment for beijing to grab the spotlight of international publicity at a time when its economy has been growing spectacularly for 30 years
815441 the first call in print for china to host the games came around 1908
815442 from the very beginning the idea of hosting the olympic games was associated with having a strong and prosperous nation that would be treated as an equal by other nations
815443 its practical goal is to use the olympic games to internationalise china and create a generation of chinese people that are equipped to be world citizens
815444 its not always the case that when the olympics are hosted that they take on such a strong nationalistic image
815445 and i think the chinese people agree with this there is a kind of history in chinese popular perception of humiliation over the last couple of decades
815446 a sense of restoration of what chinese people may view as their rightful place in the world
815447 its a sign that our country has become richer and stronger and that we are now part of the international community
815448 i am very proud of my country because we are proving that we can hold such a big international event like the olympics
815449 chinese people have a pride of association with the achievement of modernisation and development
815450 this is probably the first time in a century that they can take real legitimate pride in something that is chinese uniquely chinese its been a long time coming
815451 why should i learn a foreign language i dont have time for that
815452 china has effectively mobilised a kind of popular outrage a nationalistic response
815453 the police call us for neighbourhood meetings every few days now
815454 they ask us if weve seen any illegal behaviour like gambling and so on there are all these new rules on what we can and cant do they are rushing through all these new measures i know its for our security but its all at the last minute i am worried that we are just not ready
815455 if there is a taxable transaction and a taxing authority can get its arms around it its going to pursue it
815456 the other part is that judges are not trained in computer technology and the internet they dont necessarily understand the ramifications of their rulings
815457 legislatures in states and the federal government need to take into consideration the balance
815458 the need to allow the internet to dynamically grow on its own free course

815559 the most conservative bishops in the communion said that if i were included they wouldnt come
815560 then of course that wasnt enough for them and they didnt come anyway you know it may be strong language to use but bullies never get enough
815561 bullies always come back for more and the one thing that i think is that nothing short of total victory will satisfy these guys
815562 there is enormously strong commitment among the bishops present at lambeth to stay together and that is a very positive outcome
815563 now of course there are some bishops who arent here and archbishop rowan spoke about how he intends to be in touch with them and consult with them and try to involve them in this process going forward
815564 i understand disappointment about that on both sides i think theres desire to resolve the issue but different groups want the issue resolved in different ways
815565 we do need to stay engaged with each other and have high quality level of relationships in order for us to discern the truth so the process will be ongoing theres no quick fix for it
815566 it would be claiming too much to say its unanimous the vast majority of people are connected to the processes and ideas which have been outlined in the final document
815567 we undertake so many audits of our own we do know we have no systemic problem in this company
815568 we would never let an aircraft take off unless it was absolutely fixed properly the engineers wouldnt allow that

815571 the training in the past was training for trainings sake completely not linked with any real job at the end of the training

815573 there have been big corporate drives for indigenous employment in the past but weve stopped short of guaranteeing the job
815574 i think its an enormous opportunity and it fits a piece of the jigsaw that has been missing in our welfare reform drive
815575 wouldnt that make a great soundtrack for a david lynch movie

815587 what suit did you buy today to wear to this interview
815588 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
815589 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
815590 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
815591 between 2009 and 2013 cricket would promote itself to the ioc as a prospective sport and if we get it right cricket will be invited to the olympic party in 2020
815592 they would be investing in the future of the sport because by having a mens and womens competition at the olympic games many more countries would be drawn to cricket
815593 it wouldnt surprise me if countries like the usa china italy france and japan become competitive very quickly in twenty20 especially in womens twenty20 i believe that in time the success of cricket at the olympic games will lead to more test playing nations something that the sport will need in the coming century
815594 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 of the worlds population in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members
815595 while we believe that premiers offer does not adequately recognise the underlying value of just group and its future growth prospects the special board committee acknowledges that in light of the changed circumstances shareholders should accept premiers offer if it achieves acceptances of 50 per cent or more or alternatively sell their just group shares on market
815596 we believe it is now in just group shareholders best interests for premier to achieve a relevant interest of 90 per cent or greater so that all just group shareholders are able to access the additional 15 cents per share cash consideration and be potentially eligible for capital gains tax scrip for scrip rollover relief
815597 the government has not succeeded in tackling inequality and educational failure
815598 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
815599 david cameron has already said he cannot guarantee the future of emas under a future conservative government and this latest attempt by michael gove to undermine them suggests they have a secret plan to cut this vital support for students on low and middle incomes
815600 as an independent evaluation from the institute for fiscal studies showed earlier this year ema has been a real success with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to stay on in education at 16 as a direct result
815601 we will build on this success and from next month every young person on ema will get a firm guarantee of financial support if they go on to university

815636 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the
815637 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
815638 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less

815669 middle class families are becoming poor families and poor families are going into total poverty and its really a shame

815674 amid all temptations his new england birthright traits of simplicity thrift straightforward honesty and deep religious feeling
815675 not that many people seem to know who thomas crane is
815676 i agree that the scraggly elm in the southwest corner of the library grounds should be cut out
815677 the great need of this institution is a commodious and better adapted library room in a more central part of the town
815678 and my financial reservoir has begun to receive some rills of revenue i want to increase a little that fund which you have called by my name if it is not exhausted
815679 as an architectural monument the crane library is as important as any other historical or architectural artifact in quincy
815680 architects say its a design problem and they can solve it but richardsons buildings were not designed to be added to
815681 we wanted the h h richardson building to remain a living part of the library
815682 too often buildings that are architectural gems become museums and nobody really enjoys them
815683 is a pair of rings like the kind gymnasts swing from that are fastened to one wall richardson used them to pull his great bulk upright probably when he got out of bed yet this sick man never flagged working until the end with enormous energy

815685 write this down willow street under the curtis tomb youll find your window
815686 i put it on my sisters lap and drove away
815687 i stand in the atrium and i look to the left and i see the wall of the coletti building
815688 richard bertman did a wonderful job of incorporating both old and new parts of the library
815689 instead of the narrow vertical proportions and gothic features used by his contemporaries richardson favoured horizontal lines simple silhouettes and large scale romanesque or byzantine inspired details the crane memorial library in quincy mass 1880 82 with its granite base clerestory windows tiled gable roof and cavernous entrance arch stands among his finest mature works
815690 the general form of the building is simplified to one comprehensive shape with a minimum of elements each of which articulates a particular interior function window wall for reading room to the right entrance arch tower for a staircase leading to offices behind the second story gable and raised windows in the stack room to the left
815691 i dont think you have to know anything about history or architecture to be affected by how beautiful that building is
815692 its a warm building that radiates a sense of power and permanence that modern architecture doesnt have
815693 if you are adding a little bit to an old building you would keep the architectural styles similar
815694 but if you are adding a lot you are changing the whole character my sense was that if we tried to be the same
815695 hi im just sexy enough for you to notice me wink wink but im elegantly understated im well groomed without being high maintenance im quality im sporty on the weekends you can introduce me to your parents

815699 perhaps richardsons most representative building is the crane memorial library quincy massachusetts 1880 83 the general form of the building is simplified to one comprehensive shape with a minimum of elements each of which articulates a particular interior function window wall for reading room to the right entrance arch tower for a staircase leading to offices behind the second story gable and raised windows in the stack room to the left

815721 el hecho de que blu ray haya ganado la guerra de formatos es un gran logro para sony
815722 tener todo el espacio extra en el blu ray puede ser til para nosotros por encima del hecho de que el sistema no es tan bueno en relaci n con el procesamiento
815723 this is a big night for people and based on past years theres 400 000 down here
815724 has muns board of regents acting on the recommendation of the presidential search committee brought any names forward for cabinets the premiers consideration
815725 we have had no correspondence from the board of regents and the presidential committee
815726 the minister became aware of the short list last winter spring through routine contact with the chair of the board of regents

815729 i dont you blastin the top of my head off dump some fuel please
815730 its very important for the citizens of texas to remember that jose medellin brutally and viciously gang raped stomped kicked slashed strangled and murdered two teenage girls in houston
815731 the world court has no jurisdiction here in texas were concerned about following texas law and thats what were doing
815732 if the world sees us ignoring the rights of foreign nationals arrested here there is very little reason for them to recognize the rights of u s citizens
815733 mr perry can flex the states judicial muscle and show the world that texans dont bow to the whims of some distant obscure international court
815734 but it would send an unequivocal message to all foreign governments especially mexico that this country doesnt stand by its promises
815735 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
815736 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
815737 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
815738 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
815739 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
815740 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
815741 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
815742 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
815743 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
815744 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
815745 why do you just stand there in your high tower and look down on me help me im wounded why do you not help me
815746 the guys who do those things to women are assholes i would never do that i treat women with respect a girl should be treated like a princess anything she asks for should be given to her
815747 yea its sad that those things happen to women but women need to take responsibility you cant just blame men im sick of being made to feel guilty for these things my gender do when im the nicest guy around its partly the womans own fault i treat them kind and buy them gifts i call them and ask how theyre doing i really care about them and they always choose the guys that are going to hurt them i think women like the pain i think women feed off it cause they choose the bad boys and here i am a nice decent guy and i cant get them to look twice at me they just use me as the shoulder to cry on when those guys break their heart
815748 his focus is different and hes not going to play football anymore hes just going to stress his academics and graduate in december we respect his decision we know its been a difficult one for him and one that he has thought a great deal about were disappointed to see him leave and wish him the best
815749 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
815750 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
815751 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
815752 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
815753 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
815754 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
815755 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
815756 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
815757 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
815758 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
815759 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
815760 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
815761 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
815762 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
815763 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
815764 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
815765 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
815766 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
815767 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
815768 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
815769 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
815770 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
815771 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
815772 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
815773 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
815774 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
815775 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
815776 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
815777 i think youre so lovely but i know we wont be together so i want you to be with someone who thinks youre as lovely as i do
815778 her little legs arent fast enough to reach the frisbee but shes really trying
815779 shes a bit pesky when you take her on walks you need to tug at the leash
815780 hey thats a great idea but its only going to work if you blow in this direction
815781 the games industry should also be looking over its history books the recording and movie industry has failed miserably it their campaigns against consumers
815782 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
815783 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
815784 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
815785 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
815786 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
815787 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
815788 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
815789 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
815790 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
815791 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
815792 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
815793 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
815794 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
815795 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
815796 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
815797 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
815798 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
815799 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
815800 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
815801 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
815802 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
815803 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
815804 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
815805 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
815806 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
815807 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
815808 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
815809 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
815810 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
815811 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
815812 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
815813 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
815814 the fcc decision is likely to be challenged in court if upheld it would affirm the agencys right to play online cop and make sure internet providers dont interfere with online traffic fcc officials have grown more concerned about the issue as consumers watch more online videos which take up growing chunks of bandwidth

815817 zeigt man einem amerikanischen astrologen der heute eine firma ber t ein horoskop wird er prinzipiell zu den gleichen ergebnissen kommen wie seinerseits johannes kepler
815818 nehmen wir an da zwei eineiige zwillinge im abstand von wenigen minuten geboren werden und beide sind krebs mit waage aszendenten w hrend gleichzeitig mond und mars in opposition zueinander stehen was machen sie
815819 sie teilen sich die konstellation einfach auf ein kind entscheidet sich f r den mars das andere kind w hlt den mond das erste kind bernimmt daher die mondkr fte es wird daher gef hlvoll und sentimental das zweite kind bernimmt den mars es wird spontan und fordernd

815826 wer fragt ist ein narr f r f nf minuten wer nicht fragt bleibt ein narr f r immer
815827 wenn nun die astrologen behaupten da sie aus der konstellation der gestirne brauchbare schl sse bez glich einzelner menschen oder menschengruppen ziehen k nnen dann geraten sie in einen erkl rungsnotstand
815828 hier ist wohl die frage gerechtfertigt wieso f r heutige astrologen nur
815829 vielleicht sollten wir uns auch theoretisch berlegen wie es mit kindern die zuk nftig im weltraum geboren werden in bezug auf horoskope aussieht
815830 wieso kann eine bestimmte sternkonstellation ausgerechnet zum zeitpunkt der geburt berhaupt etwas
815831 um uns eine information ber neugeborene liefern zu k nnen m ten sie doch den zeitpunkt der konzeption kennen etwas das nicht einmal die fanatischsten astrologiebef rworter behaupten
815832 damit k nnte die astrologie endlich ihr berechtigungsdasein klar beweisen
815833 letztlich entscheidend bei der beurteilung der astrologie sind die praktischen erfahrungen die wir mit der astrologie machen
815834 mars macht sie nun sehr unternehmungslustig und der merkur beschleunigt n chste woche ihre gedankeng nge
815835 nichts mit sternbildern oder anderen himmelsk rpern zu tun hat
815836 stimmt wenn astrologen das behaupten w rden dann gerieten sie in erkl rungsnotstand doch das tun sie nicht die astrologie arbeitet seit ber 2000 jahren also durchaus seit hipparch die pr zession beschrieben hat nur mit dem tropischen tierkreis die erste berlegung zielt daher g nzlich an der astrologie vorbei

815851 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
815852 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
815853 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
815854 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
815855 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
815856 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
815857 well maybe it will as its part of a larger energy package
815858 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
815859 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
815860 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
815861 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
815862 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
815863 we tell the enemies of god that god has saved those who will be even more painful for you
815864 as abu khabab has gone he left behind with gods grace a generation of faithful students who will make you suffer the worst torture and avenge him and his brothers
815865 a big name does not mean a big impact on the ground
815866 the bottom line is that those people are replaceable the organization has developed in such a way that it can survive and fill in any gap even if osama bin laden was to die
815867 al qaida might be facing setbacks in iraq but not in afghanistan and any loss will appear to its fighters as a triumph against the enemy not a defeat
815868 but thats probably the one position were not real sure about
815869 theyll drop passes theyll run bad routes but they have to keep working hard and do what they can

815873 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
815874 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
815875 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
815876 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
815877 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
815878 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well

815886 as the first point of call for many of our clients customers we have a massive responsibility to be always available for incoming calls and to be able to get the right people to answer those calls as quickly as possible
815887 from a technology perspective we also have a responsibility to maintain an efficient and sustainable work environment and as a result a major determinant of the technology we used for our new facility was its efficiency in terms of power draw and emissions
815888 moving to new premises also gave us the opportunity to extend this theme to the way we manage our call agents taking into account things like travel time and physical location
815889 nortels unified communications solutions were not only ideal for this purpose with location independent calling and presence giving us far more control and flexibility over agents whereabouts but nortels energy efficiency ratings are also far superior to those of its competitors
815890 as with any large scale technology rollout one of the biggest costs is the energy to power and cool the equipment
815891 nortel demonstrated such a clear lead in this regard with its energy frugal equipment that the savings in ongoing operation and lower tco were reasons alone to choose its solution not counting all the other benefits it offered
815892 we live in an age where hyperconnectivity single users with multiple networked devices like pdas smart phones and computers is changing the nature of the contact centre to the point where call agents can no longer limit themselves to voice and e mail interaction to service their customers properly
815893 a fully integrated unified communications network empowers the agent to field and direct any type of call from any customer using any device or media from a unified desktop client or mobile interface

815914 in our evaluation the fair isaac system proved to offer businesses greater agility to adapt to changes
815915 we noted that it allows users to write manage change and store rules themselves without bringing in an it specialist that translates to better control over decisions

815924 by far the sharpest debate this sunday was between john mccain and his own surrogates
815925 since john mccain himself has been trying to have it both ways on the social security payroll tax its no surprise that his surrogates are confused about which position to defend no amount of double talk can change the fact that john mccain is promising more of the same failed policies that have left americans struggling under the failed bush mccain economy

815936 now we can look at holding more state and national carnivals
815937 weve shied away from it lately because of the state of the pitch
815938 last time the nsw womens veterans hockey carnival was held in bathurst 120 teams visited the city plus officials and spectators
815939 each year literally thousands of people come to bathurst for hockey carnivals and spend a significant amount of money throughout the community
815940 75 to 80 per cent of those who train are not working in the field a year or two later

815943 if you go to a gp the key in to other medical services the majority of drugs dispensed are variations on pain killers and mood alterers which dont fix the problem
815944 for example arthritis is caused by lifestyle and emotion and painkillers are a temporary covering tool which doesnt address the cause

815966 the first attempt to render spiritual obedience will quickly convince us of our utter helplessness we might as soon create a world as create in our hearts one pulse of spiritual life and yet our inability does not cancel our obligation shall god lose his right because sin has palsied our ability the obligation therefore remains in full force our inability is our sin our guilt and our condemnation in this view are brought together the supreme authority of the lawgiver the total insufficiency of the creature the full provisions of the savior and the all sufficiency of the god of grace we pray for what we want we are thankful for what we have we trust for what is promised

816004 i have to say after 4800 words i am a little disappointed i expected something a little more interesting i came out with more understanding so it was worth the read but there isnt much of practical use here at most it might help optimising queries on mysql
816005 however this leads me down a route you didnt mention at all it means that any aggregate function whose result can be computed from columns of any single row will yield the same value as any other such function if its expression is based only on functionally dependent columns
816006 in mysql one can write group by queries that reference non aggregated columns in the select list that are not included in the group by clause even if these columns are not functionally dependent upon the group by clause this behaviour conforms to none of the sql standards versions
816007 it is possible to avoid this behaviour by including only full group by in the sql mode server setting but it might make more sense to take advantage of the ability to write only partial group by clauses
816008 because of the sound it makes each time it is dumped into the argument list of a function that makes up the servers source code

816023 what i like about the iphone is that the email function works well i have my gmail and my work email set up on microsoft exchange and that works seamlessly i also like how my calendar is synced to my work one
816024 using wifi on the iphone 3g is great and particularly useful for using the youtube application i have already used 50mb on my 250mb data plan with 3g and i am not too sure where it went using the web browser safari is great i can view most of the websites i visit
816025 what i dont like is that i cant view flash such as when i want to watch a news piece on tv3s website
816026 my iphone has also frozen up once for about two minutes and that scared me a bit
816027 other than that its fantastic i was waiting for a client who was running late at a caf but the caf had wifi i was quite happy to be able to check my work emails and websites while i waited
816028 i still love my iphone as much as when i bought it
816029 the app store is filled with awesome apps available for free or at a cost
816030 the best feature i found was the ability to use your iphone as a wireless keyboard for the apple tv
816031 a few of the free apps seem for the sake of it not really practical but in saying that there are a lot on there that are just too cool
816032 for those who havent seen sms on the iphone it is amazing
816033 i have found one little bug in the sms application im not sure if it is just my iphone or something in the iphone os but occasionally my iphone will stop making the txt alert sound and just vibrate instead i have to reboot to fix the problem this bugs me but its not major
816034 i chose the 80 a month plan with vodafone and so far have found it to be ample for my needs apart from the txting
816035 i found that 80 is worth it to me the only thing lacking support on vodafone is visual voice mail this hasnt bothered me as if you tap the voicemail button the iphone dials vodafones voice mail
816036 to summarise after owning the iphone for a few weeks i have found the device to be even more amazing than i had expected the app store is so valuable to the iphone i think it will play a huge part in the success of the new model the plans once you get over the initial bite are generous and the iphone works well on the vodafone network

816040 oh yeah this is just how i want to tune up for the mac its very challenging its probably the toughest non conference schedule weve played theres no break in there
816041 well know what kind of football team we have after those four games
816042 i try to be as calm as possible through pregame but im sure there will be a lot of electricity
816043 this place will be packed it will be nothing like the doyt has ever experienced bringing in a big 10 team the atmosphere is going to be crazy
816044 were not chasing first were actually picked to win it for me its exciting i like having that target on our back i like having the respect of the voters
816045 our out of conference is always tough every year we have a big 10 team and top 25 teams and this year is no different
816046 its a great way to start the season everyones healthy everyones fresh you give it your all and it really sets the tone for the rest of the season
816047 i feel adebayor felt people questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer always is to give on the pitch
816048 you play well and show you are ready to fight for your shirt and your team he does that he is a man with character
816049 you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly their frustration
816050 you have to show it with performances in this job
816051 im very happy as a footballer a lot of clubs will look for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world there are lots of young players and i have a big chance to have a good career at this club
816052 when there is a lot of speculation they the fans believe what they read in the newspapers the most important thing is to keep on enjoying your football
816053 some of the fans will love you and some will hate you but im in a good position and most fans love me for me what happened this summer is over
816054 you have to come on the pitch enjoy your football and show them you have desire to play for their team
816055 europe is important the premier league is important the fa cup and the carling cup so we will try to win every trophy and you never know
816056 we will try to win from the first game and then see the situation
816057 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
816058 we started really well and finished really well last season
816059 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
816060 nortels global leadership in gsm r is the result of an early and significant investment in this technology which has been developed to meet the communications needs of leading railways worldwide
816061 we believe the industry is at an inflection point in the way enterprise and service provider networks and data centers are being architected customers are demanding networking solutions that meet the needs for today and can address the many advances in network convergence that are still ahead
816062 brocade has taken an important step through this acquisition in developing a networking infrastructure strategy that will serve as the foundation for capitalising on these dynamic opportunities
816063 the integration will be complete like the acquisition of mcdata before and foundry as a name will cease to exist following the assimilation i am not sure whether that will happen exactly by the start of fiscal year 2009 though however we will continue to keep the products and solutions of foundry as they are because customers are used to these names
816064 it is too early to say right away brocade has succeeded with the integration of mcdata which was about the same size as brocade and had a complex structure i think it will be easier with foundry which has the same go to market strategy as brocade they are indirect and they go through partners with all channels in place we will continue to offer our solutions and even more with the arrival of brocade in the networking space
816065 at first i wanted to stay in the premier league and i had the pen in my hand to sign
816066 then at the last minute they said that the chairman wasnt here and i had to wait
816067 last week he did a bit of all right and then today when he came on he made a couple of point blank saves
816068 hes been fantastic hes training hard hes keen hes a pleasure to work with and today he showed again that hes still got it
816069 were not looking at mark for the season were looking at the five game gap when danny vukovic is suspended
816070 were a very small club if he keeps doing okay theres no reason why he cant get back to europe and maybe thats the platform mark is looking for
816071 when the transfer window opens up over there opportunities are going to arise
816072 i will not react because we want to keep our best players
816073 we are going in to a season now and we have to have everybody focused on our targets
816074 if we can bring in one more player we will do it if not we will go with the squad we have i am happy with that
816075 i know the two clubs are still in communication about a deal
816076 we are awaiting to conclude everything and we are waiting in barcelona
816077 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
816078 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us
816079 maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
816080 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
816081 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
816082 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
816083 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
816084 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
816085 blew out my flip flop stepped on a pop tart

816087 perhaps the lakes are like the island on lost they moved
816088 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment
816089 the sa government has been leading the way nationally to seek action on trans fats
816090 at the next meeting of national food and health ministers i will be raising the issue again with a view to seeking a national approach to banning or controlling these fats
816091 i also call on food manufacturers and restaurants to cut trans fats or label their menu and products if they use trans fats so consumers know exactly what they are eating
816092 really hopeful of support at a national level on this really important issue
816093 we are pushing for mandatory labelling and were also looking at encouraging the food industry to remove trans fats
816094 banning them is not going to be a bad outcome but its probably not the most effective move
816095 there are other things we could look at like better labelling looking more at saturated fats and encouraging food suppliers to use polyunsaturated and mono unsaturated fats
816096 but it is really the saturated fats we need to concentrate on
816097 trans fats are bad but so are saturated fats and saturated fats are much more prevalent
816098 i can understand the concern with trans fats and i can understand why they think its a good health thing to do or a good political thing to do or both

816106 im going to swing more aggressively because lately id been tentative
816107 the doctor said everything looks good so thats the only thing it can be
816108 i feel like ive had some good at bats and some success since ive been here
816109 i dont want to go ahead and ban you because that sounds a bit hard to me and i believe that you have a reason why this happened that you were lonewolfing not following orders
816110 the government is committed and i am sure so is the union to doing what is best for our students and our schools
816111 it is inevitable that if we keep talking and negotiating around that focus we will come to an agreement and resolve this dispute
816112 my initial reaction would be to speak to mr caica to see what offer they will put to us but it is good to hear he is confident it can be resolved
816113 it does seem a fairly positive statement and it is much more positive than the approach that the former industrial relations minister michael wright took and that can only be a good thing enough is enough and we are prepared to continue action right up until the next election if we have to
816114 no one wants to be on strike no one wants to lose productivity and no one wants to have a situation where children are not at school the quicker it is resolved the better it will be for everyone

816119 and whats most clear in all of this is that the small independent passionate blogger who writes day and night about whatever it is that captures her imagination plays an important role in the ecosystem they keep the larger blogs honest and the best of them will grow into large properties in their own right its a beautiful nasty hyper competitive and chaotic world we bloggers live in and most of the time i wouldnt change it for the world

816179 for my own part i tend to find the doctrinal books often more helpful in devotion than the devotional books and i rather suspect the same experience may await many others i believe that many who find that nothing happens when they sit down or kneel down to a book of devotion would find that the heart sings unbidden while they are working their way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in their hand

816280 it is probably premature to make a statement of the kind that women are less interested in fiero or excitement than men

816282 a gp a surgeon and a microbiologist go to the toilet the gp washes his hands afterwards the surgeon washes his hands first the microbiologist washes his hands in the urine as its the cleanest thing in the room
816283 the problem is that for whatever reason the combination of crap water pressure in my office combined with whatever kind of soap they use in the dispenser means that in order to rinse my hands of soap well enough it takes about 2 minutes of leaving my hands under the sink
816284 other scientific superstitions food spoilage bacteria can harm you in small doses so throw out anything from the fridge past its bbe date no wash it it will be fine clean with lemon juice if youre really worried food left at room temperature will be where the pathogenic stuff grows and you cant see it as easily
816285 i never understood if they meant 99 of germs that are present or 99 of bacterial species
816286 but the point was that growing up on a diet of this stuff actually improved their immune systems the catch is probably that you have to grow up on it
816287 its gotta be 99 of bacteria present a bleach manufacturer is never going to obtain samples of all known bacteria to test that it can kill them
816288 the sanest might be zenben and im not too sure about him to be honest gt
816289 and as peter says if it only gets rid of 99 out of 100 bacterial cells what youre really conducting is a selective breeding programme to produce stronger more bleach resistant bacteria madness
816290 ive played a nintendo wii i dont see it as a competitor its more of an expensive niche game device
816291 3 some try to innovate but in my opinion they fail just because the games using the innovations are hardly what you can call games 5 when games try something new the communities almost all react in a disapproving way without even trying they condemn the games that try to be different
816292 i think gamers have at least become older and something tells me past a certain age the older you get the less hardcore you tend to get probably something to do with having less time though who knows maybe there is a deeper mental change brought by age as well
816293 omfg all games of this genre must have this from now on and maybe we can patch this in to existing games too and perhaps we can crowbar this into games of another genre somehow
816294 whereas a gimmick is something cool but you probably dont want to see it in more than say 3 4 sequels
816295 i wonder if this is one of the fundamental differences between so called hobbiest and casual players ie a casual player is a person who does not make the distinction between innovation and gimmick as defined by zeech while the hobbiest is a person who would
816296 to me a bigger problem is not that the industry isnt innovating its that many new games arent even stealing the best features of previous similar games everyone is too busy reinventing the wheel and we rarely move forward
816297 i hate seeing nintendo profit how dare they start making games im not interested in forget everyone else im the only one that matters gt o
816298 i died a little inside when i saw that wii play was the best selling one
816299 too many people buy into this thinking a non gamer getting a wii and wii sports is being converted into a gamer who will then buy real games
816300 this would definitely not be as good without this control scheme
816301 well is that entertainment or is that rehabilitation what is it we call it and i think for me i dont really know the answer to your question because i just look at it and i see i have this system with which i am able to create interactive experiences and what we call that system i dont really know
816302 you wanna race how bout we race to see who can eat the fastest
816303 what is less clear is what this change means for the rest of us
816304 im rather less sure its good news for anyone else
816305 what is less clear is what this change means for the rest of us
816306 im rather less sure its good news for anyone else
816307 all the wii version does is this instead of pressing b now you shake a stick it doesnt matter how you shake it either is shaking a stick more fun than pressing a button maybe but the fun of these games doesnt come down to the physical act of pressing buttons so its a moot point
816308 can you honestly tell me that you enjoyed this iteration more than the previous ones on the gamecube
816309 honestly i think the real question lies into what defines a game what is a game because like art that definition can change radically based on the perspective of people in question
816310 saying things like what is less clear is what this change means for the rest of us and im rather less sure its good news for anyone else creates an us vs them mentality which i think should be avoided
816311 a game design is a collection of interesting decisions and the
816312 strategy games are the original games humans first discovered gameplay with backgammon and chess and go
816313 at a high enough level of grokking there would be no choice
816314 the only way to do great work is to love what you do
816315 ah but it is such a great hypothesis it explains so many things
816316 the ultimate reason the photons behave this way is brushed under the carpet
816317 the ultimate reason the photons behave this way is brushed under the carpet part of the assumed background of the materialistic explanation things are how they are all that is available to us is mechanical explanations
816318 if we grant that the laws of physics would continue to operate even if we were not here to observe them then the first question is a legitimate one
816319 why should there be an ultimate reason the scientific materialist explanation youve given describes everything relevant to the question and under that remit doesnt need to go any further
816320 as zenben also stated it is hard for me to see a carpet here apart from the
816321 the universe presuming for a moment that the universe is non sentient does not know about causes only mechanisms
816322 i think people insist on seeking reasons in the sense of the reasoning of the great somebody because they simply cant be content with the answer there is no reason
816323 the point i am making here is that other people prefer other teleologies
816324 when in fact the materialist position should have no need of it
816325 you seemed to be trying to get all three teleologies to answer the same question when in fact the question itself has to be understood three different ways based on the teleology used
816326 yes and the point i was making was that you seemed to be trying to get all three teleologies to answer the same question it was most clear viz materialism when in fact the question itself has to be understood three different ways based on the teleology used
816327 it was a real challenge to figure out how to get meredith to the place where she was healthy enough to make this step with derek
816328 now its really exciting to see whats going to come next and how shes going to deal with living with a boy and all the things a man like derek who has been married and is a grown up might expect
816329 youre going to see a lot of really interesting sparks between the two of them
816330 we dont really know ericas side of the story yet
816331 were going to watch the larger world of what happens when the two of them come out of the hospital and what happens when callies dad finds out
816332 there might be some other guys in there for her
816333 promote public understanding and acknowledgment of the naturalistic worldview which is free of supernatural and mystical elements
816334 educate society toward accepting the full and equitable civic participation of all such people
816335 people were falling at his feet weve had kylie minogue on that set but it was dawkins people were worshipping
816336 isnt it a form of child abuse to label children as possessors of beliefs that they are too young to have thought about
816337 i urge you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned keep away from them
816338 you didnt get healed because you didnt believe hard enough also youre probably going to hell because of that
816339 thats merely taking the opposite extreme like being a feminist to battle inequality
816340 looking around the world today can you honestly say that religion has made a very positive influence on the world today
816341 chris im not sure if youre going rather too far on the guilt by association of the brights with dawkins
816342 dawkins merely hopes that chris upbringing was not dominated by religious and spiritualistic imagery and that he was more free to make his own decisions
816343 equally the issue of ethics is irrelevant it is rather self important of christianity to claim that it is the reason why proper ethics are in existence today any meagre study of ancient greek or roman history should hopefully show that the basics of ethics were in place long before the advent of christianity
816344 i think the only inference you can draw from those experiences is that children are assholes and will bully anyone for any reason they can find i dont think its valid to bring that example into a discussion of religion bigotry freedom etc
816345 for instance are we considering religion and spirituality to be the same thing are we considering atheism and a spirituality to be the same
816346 does not mean that i can blame him for the popes position that prophylactics are a sin a viewpoint which many claim is hugely criminally neglectful in light of the aids epidemic
816347 besides im not an isolated case there were many like me and probably still are
816348 i know any belief system has the potential to become like this but from what it looks like to me religions such as christianity tend more towards this extremism than say atheism
816349 its just that like probably every other religious person and their dog would say such abuse doesnt appear to me as a direct byproduct of revelation but as human corruption thereof
816350 why are people so afraid of feminism anyway though come to think of it automatically assuming a bra burning butch dyke separatist interpretation of feminism is a lot like automatically assuming a fire and brimstone interpretation of religion wouldnt you say
816351 the world of the child is not that of the adult
816352 id like to observe at this point that 75 of catholics in the us disagree with the popes position on contraception
816353 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
816354 such an action is deeply offensive a form of spiritual harrassment
816355 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
816356 this throwaway comment makes me sad why are people so afraid of feminism anyway
816357 go into all the world and give the good news to everyone
816358 i think there are a few mental crimes that many religions fall prey to but some flavours of atheism and agnosticism dont the crime of stating that you have the only absolute truth and denying all other truths when you dont absolutely have the facts to back it up
816359 the crime of believing itself its own people its own species etc as special above all others
816360 i think the flavours of atheism that resulted in atrocities eg communist style atheism are guilty of some of those crimes which should make us especially wary when we see them elsewhere
816361 trying to treat the issue of religion as if it were a referendum on christianity is culturally naive
816362 i would like to oppose this kind of distortion of christianity but i dont think removing the parents right to freedom of religion is the way to approach it
816363 all belief systems are open to corruption and horror dont let the manifest problems with corrupted christianity in the united states blinker your perspective in this regard
816364 thank you so much for sharing your perspective here im sure you have no use for my sympathy but i greatly feel for what you had to go through which was clearly far far worse than anything dawkins and i can account
816365 that being said im curious if you dont think removing the parents right to indoctrinate the child is the way to go then what would you suggest
816366 jake is telling everyone they are getting married at christmas
816367 he told me he had proposed several times but she kept telling him she wanted to give their relationship more time
816368 when he asked her again a couple of weeks ago she finally said yes
816369 it wouldnt hurt if when a woman came home a guy ran up to her with his tail wagging and he showered her with kisses
816370 that kind of genuine excitement to see someone is something id like to see in a man to be honest
816371 they were really affectionate with each other and gave each other a kiss which lasted much longer than a platonic kiss should last 20 seconds maybe a little longer
816372 without going into all the details the kiss was more than just friends they seemed like there was something more going on and were very affectionate with each other
816373 matt doesnt want to be looked down on in the hood as the guy who caused all the problems

816402 if you look at everybody here people got along very well youll see that whatever it is the final document here on the platform is one that we are all going to fight for in full force as we get to the convention and i think we are all pleased with the result and we are one big happy family and now we just want to grow we want to reach out to the independents we want to bring some republicans that have been left out so they can also join our effort to elect senator obama as the next president
816403 in recent years weve seen an administration put forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we demand
816404 we will restore our constitutional traditions and recover our nations founding commitment to liberty under law we reject illegal wire tapping of american citizens we reject torture we reject sweeping claims of inherent presidential power we will revisit the patriot act and overturn unconstitutional executive decisions issued during the past eight years

816413 since i have been here it has been stop start with a lot of injuries and it is probably the first time in my career it has been like that
816414 i had a few niggly problems early on with hamstrings but i have had big major things since i have been here it is six operations i think i have had and not one prior
816415 the end of the season was great when i get in a rhythm and start playing regularly i feel great
816416 i started scoring a few goals and that will continue as long as i get on the pitch and im fine
816417 we had a good time of it and there was a feel good factor about the club and we were buzzing as a group
816418 hopefully we can start the new season in the same way as we finished the last one
816419 its an important match and we need our good players
816420 we want to qualify for the champions league and will have to be brighter than we were in the first leg
816421 we have to get our performance up we have to get our standards up and play very quickly
816422 weve had to hit the ground running with the qualifiers
816423 you dont get much time you need to produce right from the start
816424 kaunas are 15 games into their season theyre sharp and have match fitness
816425 but well be better in the second leg because weve had an extra week to sharpen up and its about going over there and doing a job
816426 we know the way they play now their strengths and weaknesses and will go there with confidence
816427 it was only a few weeks ago we were playing in a european final and now were back but faced with a different type of pressure
816428 its going to be tough i dont know if the pitch or stadium is any good but weve got to brush these things to one side and get the job done
816429 i would have to be crazy to go anywhere else

816434 after bush is a serious carefully researched and documented analysis of american policy in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks lynch and singh demolish a great many of the dozens of myths and misconceptions that have become the conventional wisdom about the bush administrations response to terrorism the decision to go into iraq and the thinking and influence of neoconservatives it will take many more such books to balance the mountain of nonsense that has been piled up by ideologically driven academics and a huge flock of journalistic sheep they should be congratulated for having made a start
816435 lynch and singh make a compelling case that the bush doctrine will outlast the current american president and they assemble considerable evidence to show that fundamental components of the doctrine are consistent with foreign policy tradition the authors skillfully depersonalize the debate about american foreign policy in order to move beyond the current obsession with george w bush
816436 this book is required reading for both defenders and critics of the current direction of american foreign policy the authors make the provocative case that the policies of the presidents to come will resemble those of the bush administration because bush himself followed the historical traditions of americas approach to the world on the other hand the authors argue that a second cold war against islamist terrorism has more in common with the first cold war than many would like to think this fascinating combination of foreign policy strategy and even constitutional law should cause readers to reconsider their fundamental positions
816437 timothy lynch and robert singh do a fine job of defending the foreign policy approach of the george w bush administration deeply unfashionable and brilliantly polemical after bush will redefine the parameters of debate
816438 p erhaps of greatest importance there is no evident wish in the us whether in the political elite in washington or in the democratic party or in the nation as a whole to abandon us primacy and exceptionalism the new president of 2009 will only in some degree alter existing policies washington will continue to want to run if not control the world
816439 the common sense view shared by the chattering classes around the world is that bush has failed that the war on terror has been a disaster and that the united states should return with all speed to the multilateral system is so unnecessarily abandoned some time during 2001 here is a book that frontally challenges all these cosy assumptions the world and the united states have changed for ever it insists and the sooner the rest of us get used to the fact the better a provocative trenchantly argued study that leaves the reader with few places to hide
816440 more compellingly than the bush administration itself lynch and singh argue that a second cold war is underway this time against radical islam u s policies they hold must resemble those of the original cold war and american responses since 9 11 are sound and will endure with panache after bush offers a well researched original and refreshing tonic to a truck load of anti bush screeds
816441 learned judicious and courageous this study of the bush foreign policy will continue to illuminate and explain long after todays philippics and polemics have been consigned to the back shelves a uniquely valuable work
816442 whatever one might think of the argument that the bush doctrine not only will but should survive the bush presidency and i for one strongly disagree lynch and singh develop it cogently and with great vigor an important contribution to the literature on american foreign policy
816443 id be very eager to publish the senator on the op ed page however im not going to be able to accept this piece as currently written id be pleased though to look at another draft let me suggest an approach
816444 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece to that end the article would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troops levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate and it would need to describe the senators afghanistan strategy spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan
816445 we have elections in this country not coronations and its unfortunate that the new york times wouldnt allow their readers to hear from john mccain and make their own judgment
816446 john mccain believes that victory in iraq must be based on conditions on the ground not arbitrary timetables unlike barack obama that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the new york times
816447 it became easier for the blogging public to look up the donors
816448 for all the criticism he took bush embodied the true principles of classical conservatism unlike this loser were stuck with now

816451 i would like to talk about the bankruptcy for a few though if anyone knows anything about filing bankruptcy then you would know that my case was filed may 11th 2004 and dismissed july 14th 2004 2 months later thats not even long enough to do a chapter 13 which by the way is a pay back plan so i had plans on paying everyone back and not chapter 7 where the creditors get nothing at any rate the case was dismissed two months later because i had worked out a deal with the creditors on my own and seen no reason for me to pay a court appointed trustee extra money every month to do what i could do on my own the reason i was so in debt is because my mother had come to live with me and she was very sick i didnt want to send her to a nursing home the thought of that made me feel horrible we had home hospice coming in a few times a week and her doctors worked with us as well we took care of my mother in my home for years and as you all know insurance companys dont pay everything so between that and my mothers prescriptions it just ate me up money wise money in the bank gone refinanced the house 2 times etc will i deny that i filed bankruptcy 1 time no i wont i chose to do the right thing which was take care of my mother in her last stages of life so if this makes me a terrible person then i guess i am

816465 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
816466 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
816467 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
816468 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field

816473 the same people who sell them today at 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
816474 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments
816475 so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication

816481 targeting of palestinian rights in general and those of jerusalemites in particular
816482 the palestinian peoples struggle is the son of today and yesterday and tomorrow since the beginnings of the last century and the palestinian people submit convoys of martyrs and prisoners and we give a full salute to the steadfastness of the palestinian people
816483 we are the rightful owners of our land and our cause is just no matter how much the occupation has swept away from us and has stayed over us
816484 the israeli occupation gives the impression that it wants to negotiate with the palestinians but at the same time practices these repressive actions of confiscating land and demolishing homes all for the sake of building the illegal israeli settlements we question their intentions to negotiate
816485 this is a sad day in the history of the city of jerusalem as we stand in front of this home with all of the people gathered around to try to stave off the destruction it illustrates the steadfastness of jerusalemites
816486 the house does not constitute any violation or engineering planning and it was consistent with the terms of height size and scale
816487 black and sad day with the unprecedented practices of the occupation era but despite the pain that covers the city of jerusalem we are confident in our futures
816488 we had asked to delay the demolition until we had the last chance to save the house talking with the mayor and the municipality and everyone we could but all went in vain
816489 attempting to get condoleezza rice to intervene just proved again the message that israeli and american sovereignty exists here in jerusalem

816497 calling these people terrorists distracts attention from the justice of their cause
816498 they have a very narrow idea of how we use words they believe words have given meanings and these meanings have certain biases or prejudices if you use words you have to accept the biases or prejudices youre stuck with them that you can use words ironically is not something they can take seriously clearly thats not true we use words to refer to things but we can refer to them ironically we can refer to them sarcastically doubtingly aggressively

816501 ie 8 now uses the best most web standards support as its default rendering mode this major decision came as a surprise to most of us and out of 600 messages posted in ie blog in reaction to such decision i dont recall a single negative one against such swindle
816502 clicking links with href attribute set to javascript does not change status bar message
816503 i can tell you what happened the eu decided they hate ms and now any innovation has to go through miles of red tape
816504 i am a webdesigner who create websites especially for correctly work on internet explorer some of my created sites are not correctly showed by using the first beta of ie so i want to know how i have to create my new websites for the future
816505 improving developer productivity is one of the primary goals of windows internet explorer 8 beta 1 for developers we set out to achieve this goal in part by providing cross browser interoperability standards compliance and additional powerful apis
816506 whats your obsessions with single quotes or double quotes xhtml html specs dont care why should you
816507 its a code example stop getting your panties in a twist
816508 firing a simple event called e means that an event with the name e with no namespace which does not bubble but is cancelable
816509 standards information there is no public standard that applies to this event
816510 users are not presented with questions they are unable to answer
816511 to help protect your security internet explorer has restricted this webpage from running scripts or activex controls that could access your computer click here for options
816512 internet explorer has removed some potentially unsafe content from this page click here for more information
816513 maybe im missing something obvious but if web developers can disable this filtering by using
816514 i suspect the false positives will predominantly be on poorly written websites that are vulnerable
816515 well then what are you doing here at ieblog if youre not a developer
816516 ive been using opera for 7 years and its always been better than ff
816517 180 million people for those keeping score thats more than the combined marketshare of all non ie browsers combined
816518 only a tiny percentage of those with vista licenses have installed xp
816519 as for ie8 why doesnt ms just give up and issue a patch that removes ie from the os completely and replaces it with firefox
816520 and if firefox was actually the default browser on windows
816521 fonts play a critical role in the display printing and manipulation of text based information and content font embedding is a broad and complex topic and we hope this website becomes a valuable resource for everyone who creates or uses fonts to learn more about proper font usage and licensing
816522 eot offers several advantages for type designers and web designers for type designers eot creation tools must respect the embedding permissions built into their fonts and eots are bound to a specific web page or site for web designers an eot can contain a subset of the glyphs and it can be compressed both of these features can shrink eot file sizes to reduce download times and improve performance
816523 web page designers should be very careful to avoid violating commercial font eulas end user licensing agreements by placing fonts on web servers
816524 ascender believes that although not perfect eot represents the best current solution for type designers and font foundries to protect their intellectual property it is the only web font embedding solution that respects font embedding permissions uses an industry proven subsetting and compression mechanism and ties embedded fonts to specific web sites ascender hopes that other web browsers will make it a priority to support eot once it becomes a w3c standard
816525 public web sites using unauthorised fonts are going to be spotted 30 seconds after they go live so its not like enforcement is even going to be that much of a problem
816526 this idea is ten years old and it was a failure then
816527 but because netscape at that time adopted another standard and we kept eot proprietary no one used either
816528 when designing for the web you have no clue what size of screen the reader is using
816529 wont be fixed in ie8 will likely never ever be fixed
816530 we will consider this for a future version of ie
816531 three versions of the embeddedfont have been defined to this point
816532 as the user browses the web the only code that runs on the users machine is code that the user allows to run
816533 the user is in control of what code runs on the machine
816534 the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to websites
816535 as the user browses the web the browser performs well and does not terminate unexpectedly
816536 people have also described ie7s phishing filter as a privacy feature because it helps protect users from sharing information
816537 provide the most secure and most reliable browser that respects user choice and keeps users in control of their machine and their information
816538 trustworthy refers to one of our overall goals provide the most secure and most reliable browser that we can that respects user choice and keeps users in control of their machine and their information
816539 complying with standards is very important for a globally accessible world wide web we at microsoft are committed to following standards and working with the w3c to develop standards before implementing them in our browser we refuse to go back to the old days of trying to create a proprietary web we understand that this makes web developers trust us because we are all about helping developers developers developers
816540 i use ie all the time and almost never have problems
816541 i find that msie renders things must cleaner then mff i use ie all the time and almost never have problems
816542 schouwenberg left said he reported the vulnerability to microsoft a long time ago warning the company that javascript embedded into gif files can be executed under certain circumstances microsoft disagreed and the issue was never patched
816543 users are not as concerned with what causes the problem whether that be a poorly functioning add on or poorly performing website
816544 a problem with this webpage caused ie to to close and re open
816545 a problem with this website caused ie to close and reopen the tabs
816546 im curious about the ie8 performance because in this moment its on last place
816547 does anyone know if microsoft is implementing ie in net now or is it still the com crap
816548 no really i do mean this content type and nothing else
816549 the whole idea of the mime sniffing logic was to make it easier for an average joe to put up a personal website without worrying about mimetype details even when web servers and isps have random default configurations
816550 broken by default unless you include our non standard tag
816551 its a status quo that every browser vendor is facing do we do the right thing and honour the mimetype and not do content sniffing with the possible effect that users will blame the browser instead of the site and switch to a more lenient browser or do we try to fix obvious mistakes made by administrators in order to give the user of our browser a better experience
816552 punish user installed activexs that dont add an super extra mega special registry key
816553 pop up blocked also to protect your security internet explorer blocked other content from this site
816554 see what we did propose a better solution if you dont like it
816555 internet explorer cannot download tdwtf fpl from eternallybored org internet explorer was not able to open this internet site the requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found please try again later
816556 remember if we significantly reduce compatibility users would not upgrade to ie8 and then everyone would be stuck with legacy security problems indefinitely anyway
816557 what stops me if i were evil from serving up a virus as one file type then set the authoratative flag to true with a content type that suggests something like a pdf
816558 but ie unlike every other major web browser thinks it should ignore the content type header when it can figure out what the page really meant
816559 im just walking my dog i didnt know this was a restricted military area sorry
816560 oops yes i did accidentally drop three rohypnols into your beer sorry
816561 for an example of how wrong ie8s guesswork can be try downloading trends sysclean com from this site
816562 implement a feature which will report back to the user if a page uses valid code has markup and or parsing css errors some sort of a webpage quality indicator icon smiley or green check for valid page frown or red x when invalid on the statusbar or somewhere else which when clicked would report more info to the user and give him more options among which one would be to validate the page with the w3c validator
816563 a previous build of internet explorer8 is already installed on your computer you must remove it before installing the latest verison of internet exploerer 8
816564 allow us to allow pop ups activex installation without reloading the entire site
816565 jack the only comments that are deleted are obscene contain offensive language or are
816566 im not exactly sure what youre referring to with regard to ctrl s functionality did this behave much differently in ie6
816567 for improved performance and application compatibility by default ie8 disables protected mode in the intranet zone protected mode was originally enabled in the intranet zone for user experience reasons when entering or leaving protected mode internet explorer 7 was forced to create a new process and hence a new window
816568 c program files windows aik tools x86 servicing pkgmgr exe
816569 wow any one done lode the new firefox 3 its like haveing free dsl it is vary fast i all so have a suggestion for ie8 is there any way we can make the new ie8 run fast like firefoxs 3
816570 w regards to question 8 and question 19 have you people actually even looked at the tabbing settings at all
816571 congratulations n00b youve opened a new tab just in case you have the mental capacity of a 2 year old we promise to remind you every single time you open a tab in related news scientist say that water is wet fire is hot and guess what that tab you intentionaly opened for the 17th time today 213th time this week and 718th time this month is a new tab this anoying message can not be removed would you like to yell at internet explorer in frustration again today
816572 hey youre writing a letter would you like me to animate in the corner and distract you while splurting random obvious bits of information at you
816573 why arent you going to implement border radius in ie8
816574 the give explanation that the move could fail and the file would disappear somewhere between universes is simply ridiculous
816575 the preferred response to this call to action is to
816576 but as competition dropped off so did microsofts competitive zeal ie 5 x and 6 were minor functional upgrades after which microsoft essentially halted ie development and pondered dropping the product as an ongoing concern
816577 standards are clearly more important than ever they often facilitate economies of scale but their real impact on technology markets is with interoperability
816578 i know a smart business decision when i see one choosing open standards is a very smart business decision indeed
816579 nice meta tag because i doubt that many webmasters will be fixing their sites for ie8
816580 the root of the problem is that microsoft from the start has chosen to provide a quirks mode
816581 this page may not display correctly do you want to use emulation
816582 when will microsoft do a browser that can really be standards compliant without adding their own non standard functions
816583 it is not a surprise that this yet another change requires action from many people cant microsoft just make an automatic functionality inside the browser to fall into ie7emulation mode
816584 msft has built x based on what the w3c drafts currently contain with minor deviations
816585 the xdomainrequest object is a safe reliable and lightweight data service that allows script on any page to anonymously connect to any server and exchange data developers can use the xdomainrequest object when cross site security is not an issue
816586 the sensible solution would thus be scrap xdr valuate it as an interesting experiment and work with the wg to get a perfect xhr v2 out after all wastin 6 months of development at ms doesnt compare with wasting 3 years of work at mozilla apple opera kde and 2 years at ms mitch
816587 i should add that you mr dutta got a small reprimand from chris wilson for putting a bit too much editing on the ms xdr proposal and smackdown on xhr v2
816588 looking forward to continued discussion on these topics there is definitely some interesting stuff in here so im glad we got this feedback
816589 xhr remains the only required object its methods and properties remain the same
816590 completely new object with its own methods to do what xhr does
816591 but on cross domain scripts without any need for validation and absolutely no setup
816592 requires no security settings that can be used on any domain you want to run whatever script you want
816593 do you want to buy stuff from a website where any third party ad could have rewritten the payment url
816594 i read all i could about this new ms object which isnt much
816595 well with xhr you can check against its credentials ssl certs etc
816596 wrong it xhr aims to do less than xhr does
816597 wrong the server must explicitly opt in to exposing data x domain
816598 if you were a good little coder meaning a lazy coder
816599 the cs xhr proposal was so unsafe that it was pulled out of ff3
816600 if everyone implements a bad idea cs xhr then its somehow magically safe
816601 you have to understand your limitations and what their expectations are within those limitations
816602 first of all you have a head coach who is an ex special teams coach
816603 he gets it jerry rosburg and i will communicate in depth prior to each game what my limitations are going to be
816604 matts been doing this long enough he doesnt need me to tell him how to kick
816605 they have a wealth of knowledge of not only how the games played but where its played
816606 they understand stadiums winds game situations probably more importantly they understand the mental aspect of the game
816607 i deal with them i dont hide them when some of those spots come up during the game the what ifs youve got to shake them off get them out of you
816608 does anyone have a plugin for ie8 that removes the goofy domain highlighting

816654 all the while many congressional members pay lip service to the idea of increasing civic engagement it is refreshing to see these members act and call on our education institutions to be more proactive in getting student signed up and aware of the laws in their various states and districts
816655 several obstacles stand in the way of youth voting because so many students are first time voters they often are unfamiliar with how to register in some states including my own state of illinois first time voters must register in person in order to cast an absentee ballot for students who attend college outside of their home state or who do not have access to transportation these requirements can be cumbersome confusing and insurmountable

816671 we do a lot together after practice and go to each others apartments just to hang out during the off season
816672 weve got some new guys that are very aggressive and fired up
816673 we are showing them some new things and there are things they are showing us
816674 we are learning this year because we know the schemes better we can concentrate on what the offense is doing because we already know our assignments
816675 last year it was different as we were trying to teach them offense defense and special teams iowa state head coach gene chizik said
816676 we were not able to get into the details of some of those issues a year makes a huge difference
816677 i started to understand what the coaches wanted from me last season
816678 i got more relaxed out there and the offense opened up for me i let the game come to me
816679 weve been studying a lot more film physically weve changed as well we had a great summer with director of strength and conditioning coach ken sheppard
816680 the one everyone is probably interested in is the quarterback battle that is the one that everyone sees the most there are battles going on all over our football team because you were a starter the previous year does not mean youve inherited a position the next year we really have battles going on all over the place doesnt matter how many years youve played here and it doesnt matter how many games youve started
816681 i was out there last year and i played and then i had the spring to better my skills
816682 its second nature ive been on the field and i know the playbook so its second nature to me
816683 thats not lip service no one is a starter there is one day that i could be working with the no 1 team and then the next day the guy beside me is working with the no 1 squad its a constant competition and everyone is working to make themselves better thats the fun about football when everyone is competing it makes everyone better

816692 board chairman steven powers has formed a committee that includes prosecutors victim advocates criminal defense attorneys and others to review the boards procedures
816693 the committees task is to review possible changes that would open parole hearings to greater scrutiny and make them more accessible to crime victims
816694 if the parole board now wants to be altruistic and say there are these things that need to be fixed but our hands are tied and we release gillmore it will be a totally aberrant decision
816695 surely the parole board ought to be forced otherwise it probably will not happen to explain to the public in writing the reasoning behind their positions for and against like that will happen who is going to pay the price if this predator is released and rapes another the victim
816696 its all about playing and nothing else i want to get out there and prove myself
816697 im not unhappy or anything i love this team i love this organization i love playing in dallas and i love to win its a great place but really its hard to be completely satisfied unless youre starting so thats obviously my goal
816698 that kind of shot down my chances to start when that happened
816699 but thats the way it goes i love ken hes a great player and he deserves everything he has hes a great player for this team too you cant get mad at that but at the same time i know its going to be harder to get in there
816700 oh its much different now because you understand whats going on now
816701 before you just got thrown in there and you were just playing but now not having started very much you want to get back in there and even if it doesnt work out here you know someone will notice so youve just go to keep going
816702 it gave me time to sit back and really learn the playbook even more i went back to playbook and tried to learn it as hard as i could i came out and got all three of my interceptions in the second half of the season
816703 i got a chance to run with the ball and show my speed a little bit that was a big play

816798 as reason tells us all are born thus naturally equal with an equal right to their persons so also with an equal right to their preservation and every man having a property in his own person the labour of his body and the work of his hands are properly his own to which no one has right but himself it will therefore follow that when he removes anything out of the state that nature has provided and left it in he has mixed his labour with it and joined something to it that is his own and thereby makes it his property thus every man having a natural right to or being proprietor of his own person and his own actions and labour which we call property it certainly follows that no man can have a right to the person or property of another and if every man has a right to his person and property he has also a right to defend them and so has a right of punishing all insults upon his person and property
816799 we are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the state the individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen he is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way his power to contract is unlimited he owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors to divulge his business or to open his doors to an investigation so far as it may tend to criminate him he owes no such duty to the state since he receives nothing therefrom beyond the protection of his life and property his rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the state and can only be taken from him by due process of law and in accordance with the constitution among his rights are a refusal to incriminate himself and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law he owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights

816820 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
816821 i want the michigan delegation and the florida delegation to be seated and however the democratic national committee determines we can get that done im happy to abide by those rules
816822 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
816823 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
816824 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today sen obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
816825 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

816880 my sense of modernism before reading josipovici was that it was simply this moment in time in which new techniques expanded or advanced the modes available to writers since reading josipovici most references i see to modernism appear to be based on the same conception
816881 n ew techniques were more than a reaction to old techniques they were reactions to modes of perception to ways of conceptualizing the world
816882 concerned with techniques in themselves than with the broader agenda they were meant to serve

816895 a lot of nights out of the pen were lefty lefty lefty
816896 its nice to have a power right hander out there too ive tried to show him that i have confidence in him and lately hes given me that confidence right back
816897 that kid is going to be a big part of this team when we win something
816898 we all know about the arm trouble and how he lost all his velocity last year but hes completely back to where he was before
816899 weve been trying to get him to throw more strikes but that to me is all a matter of gaining more and more confidence
816900 i cant say enough about what he has done before i got here and since i got here
816901 hes not the biggest guy but hell jump at you with his fastball at about 90 91 or 92 and thats not slow
816902 hes been great hell be my guy in the bullpen tonight
816903 he swung the bat yesterday and felt pretty good but hes still a day or a couple of days away
816904 that spot in the lineup has come up a lot and we know what kind of damage he can do just when he draws a walk
816905 well see tomorrow its not comfortable id be able to play if it was comfortable
816906 youve got to wait until you see what happens tomorrow when he gets checked when we go to anaheim
816907 im concerned but im not smart enough to know whether its a long term injury or not
816908 i had it taped yesterday after it happened but i woke up and i couldnt walk if need be i can play but it was something where i didnt feel comfortable i was basically icing it all day my right ankle felt like this the other day so hopefully i can bounce back as quick as i did the other time
816909 i think hes going to be very serviceable for us
816910 that was one of the reasons we decided to shut him down when we did on july 6
816911 we wanted a 100 percent flash gordon down the stretch he can be a significant contributor if hes healthy and pitching like hes capable of pitching

816914 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a 17th season
816915 he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
816916 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
816917 i know packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
816918 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers

816929 what we have presented are options that will really make a difference at the pump free our oil mr president were sitting on 700 million barrels of oil that would have an immediate effect in ten days what our colleagues are talking about is something that wont have an effect for ten years and it will be 2 cents at the time if they want to present something thats part of an energy package were talking about something but to single shoot on something that wont work and mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump im just not going to be a part of it
816930 does anyone else find this to be stupid nobody trusts republicans they wont be listened to theyre horrible at communicating you might as well send monkeys down there tomorrow
816931 michael my friend this action by the republicans is an opportunity to do just as you say get the truth out
816932 what we really need is for jorge bush to get off his duff and call congress back into session until they make some meaningful moves on oil related issues as it stands wandering around in an unlit hall where no cameras or microphones are operating is a stunt and not an effective one
816933 exactly and that is because oil dropped over 20 per barrel and why did it drop because two weeks ago bush lifted the executive order halting offshore drilling this type of thing drives the speculators the ten year thing is horsesh t the effects of events that will bring more oil in the future are what drives the market and speculators imagine the effect that would result from an announcment that we will now be drilling in anwar
816934 a good fight is always better then caving i also think that you misjudge the american people and their ability to perceive real leadership if the media is so good tell me why 70 of americans say to drill off shore though the msm is doing its best to prop up pelosi and barry why john mccain is tied with obama in the polls despite the continued drum beat that obama is the long awaited political messiah i could keep going but wont for the sake of time remember the last time the republicans decided to fight on something we got the first republican majority in the house in 40 years heartland america admires a good fight always has and always will
816935 they are preparing their spin and lies and working on a gameplan this is not the slam dunk people think it is we have an ignorant stupid public and a conniving lying mass media going against us
816936 theyre rating whores first and foremost if they cover it and it gets some traction and it just might because a clear majority of americans support recovery of domestic oil this will be a huge coup
816937 i tend to agree with you and the other folks on this point
816938 well we are and thats a start for years since the iraq war the gop has had its tail between its legs hoping for someone to love them but like a good old guard dog they can stop peeing on the bush and start peeing on the donkey its about time dontcha think
816939 again i hope this works but as i have said many times i dont have much faith in the american public and i know damn well the mass media is working feverishly to figure out how to help obama and the dnc through this right now they are preparing their spin and lies and working on a gameplan this is not the slam dunk people think it is we have an ignorant stupid public and a conniving lying mass media going against us
816940 i hear what you are saying and i agree that the republicans have done a very poor job of trying to educate the public i whole heartedly agree that msm is lying and covering for the democrats especially obama however with energy prices so high the american public is figuring it out polls show a majority now favor drilling off shore and even in anwar dont give up yet maybe this fight can be won in the later rounds
816941 if the media is so good tell me why 70 of americans say to drill off shore
816942 i tend to be more optimistic about life after being so close to being on the dead side of it so many times in my life is all over
816943 theyre rating whores first and foremost if they cover it and it gets some traction and it just might because a clear majority of americans support recovery of domestic oil this will be a huge coup
816944 better yet send money to the nrcc and let them know youre donating to honor members of the house who are finally stepping up on an important issue money is the absolute best way to let them know you approve of what theyre doing
816945 the question that the gop must pose loud and clear on a public forum is
816946 every moment of the republican protest is an opportunity to offer an education to the public about energy and the economy and how the markets work
816947 its big oils fault for their insane profits we need windfall profits tax to punish punish them
816948 in large urban areas the culture of public education is broken if you dont fix this culture then you are not going to be able to make the kind of changes that are needed
816949 virtually every meaningful conversation ive had with people about god has either started with that question or gotten around to it before long
816950 we dont have all the answers but i think we have the questions
816951 how could an english bulldog come from a family of chihuahuas

816963 some people say that mireya luis is the best volleyball player ever i would argue that lang ping was more than just power spectacle she was smart swift and had a more varied offence than mireya luis of course mireya hit inside the ten toot line at will but that doesnt necessarily imply a better sense of ball placement all in all i think lang ping edges mireya by a narrow margin to take the all time mvp award
816964 revered by chinese fans lang ping has been honored with her own postage stamp had her wedding broadcast on national television and has stadiums named after her in china
816965 support if lang ping leads her american players to a higher standing it will be not only to her credit but a feat of which all chinese can be proud of course the chinese team is expected to give it their best thus the international volleyball world will draw more attention from people all around the world
816966 usa volleyball and ceo doug beal made a wow hire with lang ping

816970 jenny is my best friend but besides that she is one of the best coaches i have ever seen anywhere

816976 the crisis facing the institution roots from a history of neglect
816977 the prisons department urgently needs a change in leadership to root out strongly embedded practices such as corruption
816978 we understand officials want to lobby for their kin to lead the prisons department and that is why the committee was picked up
816979 i will start out by saying that susan atkins is a coldblooded murderer
816980 i was a child but i was so sick with grief that i wished i too could die
816981 she once put her hands on my pregnant belly and just cried
816982 she didnt have to say what she was crying for i knew she was looking right through me and seeing sharon and what could have been
816983 she has without a doubt paid her debt to society
816984 you see her as part of the manson family i see her as part of our family i hope you can find it in your heart to do the right thing
816985 just because susan atkins showed no mercy to her victims we therefore are duty bound to follow her inhumanity and show no mercy to her
816986 to sum up these murders in terms of cost efficiency trivializes the victims lives and the lifelong impact on the victims families
816987 in my mothers words susan atkins repeatedly committed crimes requiring full premeditation and executed them in a cavalier manner that afforded her victims no mercy

816991 chinese people have more money to spend than before and more people developed habits of doing sports
816992 said xu yang director of the brand management center of anta company a domestic brand name of sports wear
816993 the companys annual sales volume in china has exceeded one billion u s dollars this goal was realized faster than we expected
816994 beijing olympics is a perfect opportunity for us to consolidate our leading position in chinese market
816995 the center was meant to be a milestone of adidas taking a larger share of the chinese market
816996 my aunt just bought a pair of shoes and some clothes of 361 degrees and said they are very comfortable
816997 our total sales volume increased by 50 percent in the past two years we scored more than three billion yuan 430 million dollars last year
816998 there is still a big potential for the development of chinas future sports supply market
816999 its just a big weight off my shoulders to win to be done and not have to be here until next year
817000 best thing ive ever won its always been in the back of my head to win the street championship at the x games
817001 last year even when i was done i was dreading coming back here because i wanted to win so bad that i think sometimes it psyched me out its a huge contest everyone watches it
817002 i still feel that it could have been a lot better and it was way too tight
817003 its the first year of the event and its only going to get better getting skateboarders involved in the design helps a lot
817004 when this all over well sit down with them and well say ok guys let us have it
817005 what do you want what do you like with skateboarding if i sit 10 guys down im going to get nine different opinions
817006 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
817007 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
817008 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play now that were going to play with him hell make us better and well make him better
817009 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail pulling issue for us
817010 they gave me a lot of good pitches to hit and i drove it
817011 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
817012 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
817013 that just puts it in perspective there is a lot of excitement going on right now with the fans
817014 i didnt have control and when i got it in the zone they hit it hard
817015 i didnt do my job today but ill go out there again in five days and do my job
817016 church gunman says he acted out of hatred for the liberal movement
817017 violence against civilians to achieve political or ideological objectives by creating fear
817018 his decision to stay amateur another four years is going to make a difference to a lot of our young athletes who have a tendency to turn pro a little bit too early
817019 what he has done since the 2004 olympics is to show everybody just how superior he is to everybody in the world
817020 you should be taking over you should be the no 1 in the world
817021 the fact that raushee stayed another four years hes going into this competition as a grown man against grown men
817022 my coach was like hes fine hes fine just watch him
817023 even when the fight was over he was still throwing his hands
817024 having a 95 mile an hour fastball while everybody else is throwing a curveball
817025 raushees hand speed probably is the best in the world in his weight class
817026 he was always jumping in the ring pulling down the guys shorts running around and getting in the way
817027 he was always telling me he could beat this guy he could beat this guy i would say boy shut up but i figured since he was there i might as well teach him a little bit
817028 when she feels like im doing something wrong she jumps on me like she doesnt want me to follow the wrong path
817029 because he gets in the ring and he explodes like a bomb
817030 with him being so little he would have had to wait for so long
817031 he made up for it with his speed and his aggressiveness at a young age
817032 i said the what team it was like boom it just dropped in my lap we couldnt believe it we jumped up and we hollered
817033 with him being short he gives up the reach a lot to most of his opponents
817034 that makes them have to come at him with his quickness and agility he just picks them apart
817035 for the most part boxers dont like to keep their hands up
817036 they may bring them down for a minute to try to throw their opponent off but that minute is enough for him to score three or four punches then when they put their hands up hes extremely good to the body
817037 before a guy knows it hes seven or eight points down
817038 i go in there throwing all types of combinations up and down body and head shots
817039 i just had to be comfortable over it towards the end it got kind of shaky
817040 it feels like it has been a lifetime coming it has been a dream of mine since i was about 12
817041 brian was putting the heat on and i was feeling it i was just gutting it out
817042 i didnt have much in the tank it was all i had im pretty spent right now
817043 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
817044 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
817045 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
817046 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
817047 a solution that handles all framing sites not just the ones i know about
817048 a solution that gt handles all framing sites not just the ones i know gt about
817049 a solution that gt handles all framing sites not just the ones i know gt about
817050 im going to bark steadily and consistently until i get to sleep in the big basket
817051 brush out all of the tangles and make him look vaguely presentable
817052 make rubin look like a proper bichon even although tomorrow he will be back to usual bedraggled self
817053 no hes not youre an idiot who likes to pretend she has a bichon frise when she clearly doesnt
817054 the bush administration said it would ask congress to authorize the treasury department to lend fannie and freddie more money than current limits permit and buy stock in the two companies
817055 also sunday the federal reserve agreed to permit the companies to borrow directly from the central bank as investment firms were allowed to do after the near collapse of bear stearns cos in march the money would tide fannie and freddie over while the administration and congress rush the emergency measures through
817056 sundays moves by promising government funds to keep fannie and freddie operational reinforce the notion that investors can count on the government to bail them out in a crisis

817078 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues with qantas
817079 its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained

817119 how should relationships be modeled in ldap how would you model roles and resources in order to form an entitlement in ldap how should openid live cardspace etc be modeled in ldap
817120 i would love to know your thinking on why a database itself cant be exposed via the ldap protocol for example what would prevent sql server to be accessed by not only the tds protocol but also ldap the code required to make this happen wouldnt be too difficult for a talented team to get right of course if you have less talented individuals then performance or other factors may emerge anyway by putting it into the db itself wouldnt it help customers avoid purchasing yet another product with yet another support model
817121 relational databases have always had the notion of a view and it was requiring an extra product so isnt this another scenario where microsoft or other ldap vendors should be thinking about views for ldap
817122 ok so what would be the real reason why the ad schema cant be extended microsoft provides all the right tools is it stupid thinking in large enterprises
817123 sometimes an application needs to do complex searches involving information mastered in multiple locations ill make up a very simple two location example to demonstrate the issue what purchases of computers were made by employees who have been at the company for less than two years here we have to query all the purchases of computers from the purchasing system and all employees hired within the last two years from the hr system and find the intersection
817124 the real solution here is a combination of virtualization with more standardized publish subscribe for delivery of changes this gets us away from this ad hoc change discovery that makes meta directories miserable while ensuring that the data gets where it needs to go for transactions within an application
817125 virtual directories what role should a virtual directory play in an identity metasystem should virtual directory be a standalone product in the new world and simply be a feature of an sts if an enterprise were savage in consolidating all directory information into active directory why would i still need virtualization
817126 protocols nowadays the folks over at the burton group such as bob blakely dan blum and gerry gebel have put together the most wonderful xacml interoperability events the question that isnt addressed is if i am building an enterprise application from scratch should i xacml enabled think about integrating with sts stick to traditional ldap invocation or something else
817127 entitlements one missing component of the discussion is authorization and their is somewhat too much focus on identity consider the scenario where if you were to ask my boss if i am still an employee he would say yes as he hasnt fired me yet likewise if you ask him what are all of the wonderful things i can access within the enterprise he would say that he has no freakin clue but as soon as you figure it out please let him know honestly even in my role there are probably things that i can do but shouldnt otherwise have access to so the question becomes how come the identity conversation hasnt talked about any constructs around attestation and authorization
817128 workflow have you ever attempted to leave a comment on blog you will be annoyed with the registration workflow aspects the question this raises in my mind is what identity standards should exist for workflow there are merits in this scenario for integrating with the oasis spml standard but i can equally see value in considering bpel as well
817129 education right now the conversation regarding identity is in the land of geeks and those who are motivated to read specifications there is a crowd of folks who need things distilled the readers digest version if you will traditionally this role is served by industry analysts such as gartner and forrester what would it take for this guys to get off their butts and start publishing more thoughtful information in this space
817130 conferences when do folks think that the conversation about identity will occur at other than identity security conferences for example wouldnt it have been wonderful if billy cripe laurence hart where all talking about the identity metasystem in context of ecm
817131 you cant use apex or jdeveloper without oracle and thus they are not really free because you must have an oracle licensed product
817132 centrify does not require any schema extensions on ad in order to integrate a non windows system into ad see our faq directcontrol was designed to integrate seamlessly into unix by supporting the established unix standards you mention pam nss and sudo as well as standards such as kerberos and rfc 2307 assuming a customer is using windows 2003 r2 or installs the microsoft r2 schema customers will trust microsoft and install their schema just not any 3rd party schema extensions however directcontrol can install and operate perfectly even without schema modifications of any kind

817140 this resulted in a record 32 percent interest rate credited to all members accounts including those that left employment but took the decision to leave some funds behind under the rsa retirement savings account facility
817141 members of nambawan super will appreciate that on average they have a relatively wealthier retirement savings balance than any other super fund in the country this is a direct result of many factors some within our control but many also outside of our direct control
817142 for the first time we saw a greater focus on members interest being placed first with layers of member protection at the same time also political and financial stability and strong domestic and world economic growth provided the enabling environment for our record results

817280 dont mention an impending ecological disaster these days no one bothers to read what you write
817281 it is about global warming warming of hearts that are hardened and cold because of disappointment frustration and the mistakes we humans have made by wanting to do our own thing
817282 as a result we have a suffering world of inequalities and injustices where we have caused great suffering both directly by our behaviour towards each other and indirectly by our inept handling of natural resources and forces such as storms and earthquakes
817283 one example is a national identification card and data base long desired by some in government and which was mandated by legislation passed by the congress in 2005 with the supp pro israel pac contributions to 2006 congressional candidates candidate by candidate

817288 there are no plans for any report or statement regarding the findings from those hearings they are completed we do not make press releases on hearings that have already happened

817291 it is rather intended to be a planning conference at which plans will be laid and necessary organizational structures set up

817303 there are qualifications to teach or write the history of this church if one is lacking in any one of these qualifications he cannot properly teach the history of the church i will state these qualifications in the form of questions so that you can assess your own qualifications do you believe that god the father and his son jesus christ personally appeared to the boy prophet joseph smith jr in the year 1820 do you have personal witness that the father and the son appeared in all their glory and stood above that young man and instructed him according to the testimony that he gave to the world in his published history
817304 there is a temptation for the writer or the teacher of church history to want to tell everything whether it is worthy or faith promoting or not some things that are true are not very useful
817305 our individual personal testimonies are based on the witness of the spirit not on any combination or accumulation of historical facts if we are so grounded no alteration of historical facts can shake our testimonies

817312 red wine ingredient wards off effects of age on heart bones eyes and muscle
817313 i was most surprised by how broad the effects were in the mice
817314 usually you focus on slowing down or ameliorating one disease at a time in this case resveratrol influences a whole series of seemingly unrelated diseases associated with aging
817315 in conclusion long term resveratrol treatment of mice can mimic transcriptional changes induced by dietary restriction and allow them to live healthier more vigorous lives
817316 in addition to improving insulin sensitivity and increasing survival in high calorie fed mice we show that resveratrol improves cardiovascular function bone density and motor coordination and delays cataracts even in nonobese rodents together these findings confirm the feasibility of finding an orally available dietary restriction mimetic
817317 resveratrol has been shown in studies to activate the sirt1 enzyme which in turn helps tell a cell it should try to survive and repair itself

817368 it takes a game or two to get on a roll
817369 the last two games everyone on this team can hit so it was just a matter of time before we came around and started scoring some runs for the pitchers
817370 once i started throwing my breaking ball for a strike that makes my fastball a little bit better
817371 its not like i can blow people away with what i have but once i get the breaking ball over it helps out a little bit
817372 you just cant continue to not generate offence during the ball game
817373 im comfortable at the plate had a week off to rest and im just seeing the ball well put a couple of good swings on the ball the last few days
817374 hell still be one of our guys that we really look to in beijing
817375 when i got him to settle early he just got into a galloping kind of pace and they just left him alone
817376 when he straightened up in the laneway he accelerated underneath me and i knew we had a big shot
817377 when he straightened up and i went past the quarter pole i asked him to run a little and i looked over and i saw a horse on the outside fence almost and wondered where did he come from
817378 after that it was great he just accelerated and i knew i had a good shot from there
817379 when youre going a mile and a half you want to ask your horse to run as late as possible because this laneway here believe me the wire looks like its in malton sometimes you want to be as quiet and give him as little to do as possible
817380 i tried to get him back by hitting him right handed just to straight him out
817381 marlang was pretty strong but i love my horse today note to self easy on the left hand with him
817382 i didnt want to take my horse away from his running style so i couldnt attack as early as maybe i wanted to
817383 i just couldnt get to him i got nosed out late
817384 im happy for debbie trainer debbie england because this is probably the biggest race shes ever won and shes done a very nice job with this horse
817385 from day 1 she told me this was probably best horse shes ever trained and she proved me right
817386 i think he handles polytrack but hes better on turf
817387 i could see he was relaxed and i knew hed be tough from then on
817388 he just kind of said im going to give you a horse to train and he did
817389 taking nothing away from the horse that finished second but when a maiden is the favourite

817518 the nice thing about a zoo is that you can put your arms around it he says from san francisco chronicle
817519 at the news conference zoological society chairman nick podell lavishly praised the
817520 the very public tragedy overshadows decades of problems and the troubles of the current zoo administration
817521 it would appear that his management style which downplays the value of staff and the welfare of animals remains in place
817522 the boys especially the older one were roaring at them he was taunting them
817523 they were trying to get that lions attention the lion was bristling so i just said come on lets get out of here because my kids were disturbed by it
817524 as a result of this investigation police believe that the tiger may have been taunted agitated by its eventual victims
817525 this factor contributed to the tiger escaping from its enclosure and attacking its victims
817526 when they got down they heard a noise in the bushes and the tiger was jumping out of the bushes on him paul dhaliwal
817527 in the meantime i cant get out of my head the parents of those youngsters and how they brought them up is it so difficult to teach your child some basic rules for life
817528 theyre untouchable knowing most people will be intimidated by their lack of respect and willingness to be confrontationa l unfortunately for this boy tigers dont know that
817529 hey lady we dont want to fight with a pregnant woman
817530 why not if youll taunt a innocent boy who cant defend himself why not a pregannt woman
817531 instead they will hire a lawyer go on talk shows and become famous is that screwed up or what

817541 i want to be the next president of the united states
817542 its not the turkish people we greeks dislike its their government
817543 this isnt working time to start over lets start by having a tea party
817544 i cant care about what our government does all over the world i have to trust that they know what theyre doing
817545 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species
817546 hey you better call a plumber those pipes look ready to burst
817547 do you remember when we were young and you told me you wanted to have five sons someday just like our grandmother had
817548 its not personal dammit stop planting deer food and they wont come
817549 tim ill have to let you go weve got another deer emergency
817550 shes not dead shes probably just resting and im fairly certain there is no fawn
817551 i may not have been raised on a farm but im
817552 that deer is as dead as you can get and her fawn is over there on the other side of our creek
817553 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
817554 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it
817555 sadly the reason we cant do this as well inside our own species is because there are those who would as soon call you crazy as be touched by your experience
817556 the ability to look at our enemy or what we think is our enemy and see ourselves people animals that just want what we do
817557 i didnt know lavender was a greek flower good to know
817558 its a cycle of madness because each generation is doomed to repeat because no generation is equipped from the previous generation that is how i came to forgive my parents because i took at look at the parents they grew up with and so on and realized that all parents are trying to do the best they can with what they got given i know a lot of fathers are trying to find their way in the dark
817559 one could argue that religion has killed any thought that other ways of rearing children might actually work
817560 football is a prime example but now that we are forbidden from expressing the testosterone fuelled aggression
817561 a tv series i saw recently defined bravery as a guy who wakes in the morning looks at his wife and kids and does not run away that is the root of our fear we all want to run away no one likes responsibility
817562 you think a guy holding a gun is tough guy no the guy who gets up early everyday and goes to work then comes home to his family thats the real tough guy
817563 what would l be doing what did i miss out on
817564 because you dont think anything with which you disagree merits any discussion on anyones part or mulling over on
817565 in greece i used to grab all my friends hug them kiss them slap them etc here in california if i did that to my friends they woud be worried that i was trying to hit on them and when i hug my own stepfather his face turns red yet hes guy in a milllion hed do anything for me anything to help anybody
817566 look mom we are not going to cry at a sad movie sorry it would be embarrassing
817567 but they have to live and work in the world outside our family and guys dont go to the movies and cry in that world valid emotion or not
817568 and there is the overcompensation factor making up for a barely there father who had his own issues with this messy emotional business
817569 should i open the door for a date a female colleague who now might even be my boss there was also should i pay for this meal or will she be offended should i let her pay if she offers and risk looking cheap
817570 our understanding of what equality of the sexes means needs to broaden
817571 that dogs going to bite you you better stop that dogs going to bite you

817576 america is starsky amp hutch in the same way as oz is crocodile dundee americans are not the brady bunch and similarly what we aussies project into the world what we strive to project is just advertising it is not who we are in our art and advertising we encapsulate our aspirations these are collective dreams reflected in a media looking glass the real australia is not a long stretch of golden beach a tropical island paradise or a dusty outback vista in the main we are middle class and suburban
817577 it just goes to show that no matter where you are the naysayers will always have the loudest voice
817578 we are supposed to be a nation of tolerance if you criticise someone for being gay for being fat for being black or being female you will quite rightly cop a severe tongue lashing for your lack of empathy however apparently its quite okay to criticise people for being thin the phrase real women have curves springs to mind a lot of people have been saying it in response to jennifer love hewitts bikini photos initially it sounds great after all real women are allowed to have curves and still be real women huzzah what a great idea but the problem is it doesnt say real women can have curves it decrees that real women and curves are inextricably linked real women have curves if you have no curves sorry no amount of menstruation ovulation lactation or possession of a vagina is going to make up for it and bring you back to real woman status too bad
817579 i am completely fed up with everyone lumping christians together in one big box and painting them all with the same broad brush
817580 look i write the way i speak i am no grammar nazi by any stretch of the imagination but this stuff really bugs me i dont know why it just does
817581 too much too often has happened to make me doubt that someone isnt driving this bus
817582 the weight of the responsibilities i had then real and imagined broke me down to the bare minimal existence almost reduced me literally to ashes and few know that its really a miracle that ive made it on the other side alive and kickin
817583 i could do with a hug and yet theres no one at law school id even dream of turning to for that
817584 in this case here was a girl i barely knew and perhaps would have never met again
817585 but just as a buddhist monk is thankful to his poverty for reminding him of the true purpose of life so must i be grateful for having had the opportunity to learn of lifes cruelly neutral nature at such a young age through strictly imposed violent sports

817601 you can use your m a degree you just need to take a few education courses it has great benefits and you get your summers off
817602 i remember you youre mrs volonakis and i never forgot reading
817603 in every square mile of every city there is one pedophile you know him you see him every day and you probably even talk to him
817604 know they are attracted to young children by the time they reach puberty and so they take jobs where they know they will be around many children which means that the people you trust most around your children teachers scout leaders camp counsellours coaches etc have a higher percentage of pedophiles in their ranks and if a pedophiles not smart enough to get a college degree they will take other jobs around schools and camps such as camp groundskeeper or school guard or custodian
817605 they needed an extra student or the teacher wouldnt have a full class that year and besides the school has to pay extra funds for an outside instructor for dyslexic children
817606 i am very well aware of what it takes to be a teacher and i do not envy teachers their job at all
817607 i loved that that was good propoganda that was well to my mind there is nothing
817608 you also realised that the teaching day would give you just enough time to play at your real interests on a subconcious level you knew if you didnt succeed at them then you could always blame it on the fact that you had no time you had to teach
817609 my cat is awake all night full of energy and is stopping me from getting any sleep its driving me nuts
817610 ok cats are naturally active at night but i really need my sleep what can i do

817616 oh this guy is different he really will respect me in the morning
817617 ill be a really really great employee i swear i can do all kinds of things not in my job description pretty please
817618 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
817619 while we were watching he calmly walked up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stared at us and dropped the head right in front of us
817620 i dont think the guy knew him at all the poor guy he didnt see it coming
817621 by the time the police arrived the driver and the remaining passengers had all safely exited the bus
817622 at 1 28 a m the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in rcmp custody
817623 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
817624 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
817625 he walks up to the door holds the head in the door just looks at them crazy like and drops the head and walks back to the body and starts cutting more
817626 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
817627 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
817628 when we saw the head we knew he was dead
817629 i dont think the guy knew him at all i think he was really crazy the poor guy he didnt see it coming
817630 the first thing i heard was something like a terrible type of yowl and that was from the guy who got stabbed
817631 my daughter said oh my god and everybody else started screaming
817632 were never closed to looking at how canadians can be more safe and more secure
817633 this particular incident as horrific as it is is obviously extremely rare
817634 this is very rare unique occurrence bus transportation is one of the safest modes of transportation this is highly unique that something like this happened
817635 our drivers are trained to provide the safest travel for all our passengers and every time an incident occurs they know to pull the bus over and call 911
817636 we are going to do whatever we need to provide the passengers with counselling or any other measures to make sure theyre taken care of
817637 porque la lluvia te borr como un triste poema escrito con la tinta del miedo hoy esa misma lluvia me cura me lava y me trae calor de esperanza en forma de copos de nieve

817649 mi opini n sigue siendo la misma etoo est ahora con nosotros y mientras sea jugador del bar a intentaremos sacarle el m ximo rendimiento
817650 no pienso a n en la previa ahora es momento de recuperarse del cansancio preparar el encuentro en nueva york y luego pensar en la previa eso s pedro ya apuntaba maneras en tercera divisi n est respondiendo muy bien y es un privilegio tenerlo con nosotros
817651 i dont know how to get over it and i dont know if i can get over it
817652 dont do it because you want to do it because i asked you
817653 puedo confirmar que usain correr los 100 y los 200 metros en los juegos ol mpicos es el m s r pido del mundo en ambas distancias este a o
817654 usain est a punto ha trabajado mucho para ganar las medallas de oro en ambas pruebas ese es su sue o y todos cuantos le rodeamos creemos que puede conseguirlo le animamos a que persevere y a que ofrezca mejor de s mismo en la pista
817655 la especulaci n est yendo demasiado lejos es el tema estrella en espa a y eso nos acaba cansando
817656 algunos de nuestros jugadores creen que se est hablando demasiado de su contrataci n la de cristiano ronaldo y no sobre c mo est el equipo sus estrellas y mientras todo el mundo pendiente del pr ximo rumor sin que haya nada concreto
817657 creo que cristiano ronaldo se quedar en el manchester united sobre todo si uno escucha los comunicados del club ingl s no parece para nada que le vayan a dejar salir
817658 a la comunidad internacional un v lido ejemplo de convivencia entre personas de las m s diversas procedencias en el respeto de la dignidad com n
817659 pueda una vez m s el deporte ser prenda de fraternidad y paz entre los pueblos
817660 con profunda simpat a este gran encuentro deportivo el m s importante y esperado a nivel mundial
817661 hemos de concentrar toda la preparaci n y acelerar todos los pasos normalmente en una pretemporada se cuentan cuatro semanas de trabajo pero nosotros apenas contaremos con dos
817662 tenemos muy poco tiempo para rehacernos al contar s lo con cinco d as
817663 el objetivo que nos hemos puesto es que el equipo llegue a un buen nivel competitivo aproximadamente al 90
817664 en los ltimos a os hemos tenido varios problemas con los nuevos a la hora de asumir c mo se trabaja en el bar a pero con los fichajes de esta temporada todo ha sido mucho m s f cil y r pido
817665 samuel es a d a de hoy jugador del bar a a todos los efectos pep guardiola tiene la ltima palabra sobre su caso y es quien est mirando sus evoluciones hablar con l y en poco tiempo saldremos de dudas sobre cu l es su futuro el nueve depende de los que tengan a bien decidir guardiola y etoo
817666 incluso si llueve durante la ceremonia de inauguraci n la actual tecnolog a puede garantizar que el efecto de los fuegos artificiales no se vea afectado
817667 me lo estuve pensando cierto tiempo mir los pros y los contras y finalmente decid quedarme en barcelona con toda la familia las primeras llamadas fueron todas positivas no fue muy dif cil llegar a un acuerdo y fue lo que yo buscaba que todas las partes estuvieran contentas y llegar a ser en europa un jugador m s importante de lo que pudiera ser en la nba
817668 hay muchos equipos sobre todo en rusia que se interesan por muchos jugadores hay equipos con bastante dinero y realizan contratos que al jugador le satisfacen logrando conformar as buenos equipos que al fin y al cabo es una cosa que tambi n el jugador busca porque no hay que olvidar que ganar cosas en europa tambi n es importante
817669 todos mis amigos todos los que me conoc an ya sab an la situaci n que ten a entre manos cuando me fui es una decisi n que no se toma a la ligera en estados unidos he vivido una experiencia all ha ido todo muy positivamente y no lo olvidar pero ya ha pasado y ahora prefiero estar en barcelona
817670 he querido demostrar que pod a jugar all y eso lo he conseguido quiz s pod an haber salido mejor las cosas pero es una experiencia que he pasado y que estoy orgulloso de haber vivido ahora soy un a o m s experto como persona estar en un sitio que no controlas te ayuda a ser m s fuerte y quiz s deportivamente tambi n me he acostumbrado a jugar con gente que f sicamente es m s fuerte
817671 personalmente busco que este equipo sea un equipo ganador quiero ayudar a ganar t tulos porque llevamos tiempo que no conseguimos los t tulos que el club merece el equipo se est haciendo bien y esperemos que todo funcione como deseamos
817672 es un objetivo que todos buscamos porque queremos que la gente acuda al palau creo que se est haciendo un buen equipo aunque al final son los resultados los que dir n si se han hecho bien o mal las cosas mi objetivo es ser un poquito el referente de este equipo ser un jugador importante y ayudar a las personas que llevan menos tiempo en el club aspiro a liderar un proyecto que luche por todos los t tulos
817673 por ahora no nos han comentado nada el liverpool est muy satisfecho con benayoun aunque es cierto que quieren fichar a algunos jugadores vamos a ver lo que pasa pero en estos momentos no lo vemos fuera de inglaterra est a gusto en la ciudad y el equipo tambi n est contento con l
817674 en el caso de salir la roma ser a una gran opci n porque est en champions y se trata de un equipo con mucha historia
817675 ilusionado y confiado porque tenemos ganas de jugar y de empezar a competir que es lo que realmente cuenta respetamos mucho a nuestros rivales pero miedo tampoco tenemos a nadie sabemos de muchos equipos que tienen un gran potencial igual que nosotros porque a un partido nunca se sabe vamos a ir con much simo respeto pero a la vez con much sima ilusi n y confianza
817676 las ganas que existen dentro del grupo por empezar a competir la preparaci n ha ido muy bien y los partidos amistosos los hemos solventado con facilidad pero ahora empiezan los test de verdad tenemos ganas de jugar y de encontrarnos con los partidos de verdad que es lo que realmente cuenta
817677 es un equipo que se lo est tomando muy en serio y que est haciendo buenos partidos de preparaci n
817678 unos juegos es a nivel internacional la competici n m s importante y por ello queremos conseguir lo m ximo y llevar una medalla para nuestro pa s es un evento que se celebra cada cuatro a os y por eso es muy especial queremos reivindicarnos en estos juegos
817679 ambiente y el potencial del grupo es el mismo el staff t cnico es diferente pero los jugadores somos los mismos y vamos a ver si tenemos la misma suerte que en la anterior etapa ra l ha realizado una gran temporada en el madrid y ricky rubio ha demostrado una madurez y una calidad incre ble para su edad tenemos un equipo muy bueno y con mucho talento
817680 bien tanto f sicamente como de confianza y de ilusi n
817681 un buen resultado para el equipo y para el pa s
817682 estados unidos y espa a son los m ximos favoritos para pek n
817683 algo extra o hab a en el rbitro hay que ser prudente en estos temas pero lo m nimo que se puede decir es que fue partidista en lo que hizo durante los noventa minutos creo que lo vio todo el mundo
817684 a los jugadores espa oles no les mostr una clara tarjeta roja que pod a haber sido decisiva
817685 cuando m s pienso sobre lo que pas en ese partido m s rabioso me pongo
817686 ha sido el mejor verano en pista dura de mi vida y posiblemente estoy en el mejor momento de mi carrera pero voy a seguir trabajando duro para seguir ah
817687 no hay tiempo para celebraciones para empezar todav a no soy n mero uno y cuando lo sea a n habr un torneo muy importante y las semifinales de la copa davis por jugarse no s si entonces todav a ser n mero uno pero si sigo jugando bien tendr mis opciones y ser el momento de celebrarlo
817688 s lo estuve un d a pero este a o los jj oo son el torneo m s importante despu s de los grand slams
817689 seguir jugando como en los ltimos meses y mejorando mi tenis para seguir ganando torneos importantes
817690 quaresma tiene una tasaci n de 40 millones de euros el precio estaba fijado antes del verano y sigue siendo el mismo el que lo quiera ya sabe lo que tiene que hacer porque para nosotros es un jugador importante
817691 y si al final juego all me gustar a que fuera en el arsenal o en el chelsea
817692 no es la nica que tengo tambi n he recibido propuestas del f tbol espa ol y de italia
817693 en buena forma estoy trabajando junto al resto de mis compa eros para llegar a punto y en la mejor forma posible a los juegos ol mpicos es una cita que nos atrae mucho a todos respetamos a todos los rivales y vamos a afrontar cada partido con la m xima concentraci n
817694 estados unidos y espa a son los m ximos favoritos para pek n
817695 estoy muy contento por volver porque es lo que m s deseaba quiero agradecer el apoyo de la gente del club de mis compa eros y de mi familia porque estos meses han sido duros para un jugador una lesi n as es complicada
817696 esta es mi profesi n y s que una lesi n como la m a es un riesgo que tenemos todos los futbolistas cuando me tir dos o tres veces al suelo para barrer un bal n no pens en nada m s entonces me di cuenta de que estaba bien y pude sacarme algunas dudas que ten a en la cabeza esto suele pasar cuando sales de una lesi n de este tipo pero veo que voy por el buen camino
817697 sinceramente lo que m s quiero es hacer una buena pretemporada coger ritmo suficiente y trabajar para estar en las mejores condiciones posibles quiero llegar sano a principios de temporada para estar a disposici n del equipo en lo que se me necesite el a o pasado fue duro porque casi no pude ayudar en una temporada que acab muy bien
817698 el jueves nos reunimos con representantes del benfica pero no nos entendimos la diferencia entre lo que ellos ofrecen y lo que nosotros pedimos es muy grande como para poder cerrar el acuerdo
817699 seguro que esta semana recibimos una oferta porque ellos est n muy interesados pero insisto en que por el momento no hay nada oficial es cierto que ha habido alg n contacto pero nada m s
817700 no pensamos malvender a nuestro jugador porque tenemos muy claro lo que queremos y lo que podemos pedir no veo tan claro que ellos lleguen a la oferta que nosotros pedimos aunque ya se sabe que puede pasar cualquier cosa tampoco s si va a ser ma ana u otro d a cuando llegue su propuesta
817701 otras personas s que lo han hecho y le han visto bien
817702 hemos establecido una buena relaci n hablamos de nuestros clubs del f tbol espa ol y sabemos que el manchester es un club amigo
817703 chris works at a comic book shop so he reviews all the latest releases but the real awesomeness lies in his ability to find obscure or forgotten comic books and write hilariously sarcastic reviews that make fun of them they deserve it
817704 no queremos llegar a la previa de la champions con desgaste
817705 con la idea de que la gente vaya cogiendo minutos y la preparaci n f sica necesaria para llegar en buenas condiciones a la previa de la champions
817706 son dos jugadores incre bles que en cualquier momento te pueden decidir un partido y gracias a dios son argentinos
817707 s lo hay un piloto que no reconozca la igualdad en mclaren
817708 la verdad es que me sent bastante c modo en todo momento y pude jugar bastante bien a pesar de que s lo llevo una semana aqu s que necesitar m s tiempo para adaptarme pero todo va bien
817709 s que se trata de un amistoso pero a nadie le gusta perder creo que hicimos un buen partido y que dimos la cara ante un rival sensacional
817710 mi misi n es tratar de tener el bal n y buscar al compa ero estas son mis caracter sticas y espero aportar mucho al equipo en los pr ximos partidos
817711 estoy convencido de que podremos formar una buena sociedad el s bado nos toc jugar una parte a cada uno pero espero que en el futuro podamos compartir terreno de juego
817712 s que me faltaron algunas cosas en ciertos momentos pero me sent muy bien con todos los compa eros y a medida que pasen los d as seguro que ir a m s
817713 if only you were half your age i could deal with you
817714 it is only inevitable for people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues
817715 did god really tell you not to eat from any of the trees in the garden
817716 we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden it is only about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that god said you shall not eat it or even touch it lest you die
817717 you certainly will not die no god knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad
817718 you signed up to go to confession so you must have done something really big
817719 o mary conceived without sin pray for us who have recourse to thee

817723 adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
817724 children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
817725 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
817726 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
817727 breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
817728 however we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective and in consequence the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
817729 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
817730 the idea of a covenant which includes as many of them as possible becomes more fragile and that means that as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
817731 thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issue about what conditions a church lays down for a blessing have to be shaped by its own thinking and its own praying
817732 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
817733 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
817734 theres a big policy debate we should be having in addition to talking about the leadership

817745 this life has been given to you for repentance do not use it for vain pursuits
817746 90 of those who left the church cant give a good reason

817805 that is the heavenly justice of it they warnt rewarded according to their deserts on earth but here they get their rightful rank that tailor from tennessee wrote poetry that homer and shakespeare couldnt come up to but nobody would print it nobody would read it but his neighbors an ignorant lot whenever the village had a drunken frolic and a dance they would drag him in and crown him with cabbage leaves and pretend to bow down to him and one night when he was sick and nearly starved to death they had him out and crowned him and then they rode him on a rail about the village and everybody followed along beating tin pans and yelling well he died before morning he wasnt ever expecting to go to heaven much less any fuss made over him so i reckon he was a good deal surprised when the reception broke on him

817826 when you see it youll understand what ive been going on about
817827 if you can outsource your payroll outsource manufacturing and other key elements of your business why not outsource innovation
817828 one of the oldest barriers to innovation is not invented here a persistent bias of even the most creative people toward their own creations and against those of people who work for other companies to help counteract n i h large corporations have promoted technology alliances with rivals as well as the concept of open innovation to draw on a wider circle of big brains not on their payroll to work on core technical problems these efforts arise from the recognition that no single innovator or team no matter how loyal to an employer or successful in the market has a monopoly on wisdom

817839 this year the top hollywords tended to be phrases rather than individual words as in years past

817841 the idea of planetary peril and impending climatic doom resonated throughout our linguistic analysis with the various words and phrases garnering hundreds of millions of citations in the end this narrowly outdistanced the word surge that also had a disproportionate impact upon 2007s linguistic landscape

817871 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
817872 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
817873 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
817874 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
817875 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil

817886 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
817887 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

817890 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
817891 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
817892 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
817893 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
817894 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
817895 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
817896 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
817897 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
817898 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
817899 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
817900 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
817901 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
817902 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
817903 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
817904 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
817905 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
817906 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
817907 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
817908 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
817909 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
817910 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
817911 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
817912 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
817913 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
817914 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
817915 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
817916 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
817917 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
817918 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
817919 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
817920 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
817921 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
817922 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
817923 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
817924 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
817925 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
817926 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
817927 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
817928 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
817929 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
817930 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
817931 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
817932 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
817933 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
817934 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
817935 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
817936 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
817937 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
817938 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
817939 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
817940 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
817941 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
817942 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
817943 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
817944 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
817945 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
817946 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
817947 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
817948 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
817949 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
817950 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
817951 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
817952 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
817953 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
817954 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
817955 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
817956 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
817957 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
817958 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
817959 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
817960 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
817961 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
817962 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
817963 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
817964 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
817965 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
817966 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
817967 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
817968 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
817969 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
817970 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
817971 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
817972 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
817973 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
817974 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
817975 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
817976 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
817977 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
817978 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
817979 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
817980 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
817981 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
817982 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
817983 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
817984 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
817985 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
817986 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
817987 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
817988 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
817989 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
817990 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
817991 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
817992 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
817993 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
817994 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
817995 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
817996 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
817997 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
817998 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
817999 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
818000 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
818001 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
818002 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
818003 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
818004 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
818005 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
818006 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
818007 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
818008 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
818009 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
818010 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
818011 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
818012 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
818013 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
818014 if the vice president says its do able i believe
818015 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
818016 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
818017 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
818018 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
818019 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
818020 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
818021 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
818022 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
818023 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
818024 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
818025 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
818026 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
818027 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
818028 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
818029 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
818030 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
818031 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
818032 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
818033 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
818034 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
818035 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
818036 testing his ideas or even his inchoate thoughts with such an array of colleagues that chicago offered him
818037 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
818038 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
818039 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
818040 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
818041 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
818042 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
818043 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
818044 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
818045 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
818046 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
818047 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
818048 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
818049 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
818050 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
818051 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
818052 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
818053 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
818054 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
818055 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
818056 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
818057 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
818058 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
818059 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
818060 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
818061 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
818062 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
818063 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
818064 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
818065 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
818066 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
818067 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
818068 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
818069 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
818070 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
818071 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
818072 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
818073 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
818074 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
818075 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
818076 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
818077 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
818078 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
818079 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
818080 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
818081 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
818082 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
818083 saya mulai usaha ini tahun 1977 awalnya iseng iseng karena kerjaan saya sebelumnya bangkrut
818084 saya pikir siapa sih yang tidak suka mainan mobil mobilan
818085 jadi saya kerjasama dengan pemilik lahan dia sediakan lahan saya produknya sistem pembagiannya dengan bagi hasil
818086 jadi di karawang saya menerapkan sistem pesan borongan pada pabrik pabrik rumahan disana
818087 karena kalau pakai sistem gaji agak repot kalau mereka lagi malas hasil unitnya sedikit saya tetap harus menggaji mereka
818088 jumlah pengrajin kami pernah mencapai 200 orang ketika itu produksi sangat banyak sekali bahkan sampai diekspor ke belanda jerman australia dan jepang
818089 sampai sekarang pun sebenarnya permintaan masih sangat tinggi namun tidak bisa kami penuhi karena pengrajin kami saat ini jumlahnya tinggal 40 orangan
818090 padahal permintaan dari belanda atau jerman misalnya mereka biasanya minta 200 unit sekaligus per negara
818091 dengan keadaan seperti ini saya berpikir untuk bikin pabrik namun modalnya cukup besar sekitar rp 300 500 jutaan modal tersebut untuk membeli gudang mesian dan sebagainya
818092 buktinya di tengah kenaikan bbm seperti ini ketika kami menaikkan harga jual permintaan tidak berkurang
818093 namun untuk bikin pabrik kami terbentur modal ingin mengajukan ke bank tapi kami tidak punya agunan lagipula bank juga tidak percaya dengan usaha ini
818094 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
818095 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
818096 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
818097 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
818098 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
818099 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
818100 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
818101 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
818102 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
818103 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
818104 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
818105 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
818106 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
818107 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
818108 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
818109 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
818110 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
818111 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
818112 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
818113 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
818114 student evaluations are one important factor in decisions affecting the career of your instructor
818115 perhaps then professor obamas observation of the way other legal scholars such as robert bork and lani gunier had had their work distorted for partisan political purposes counseled him against publication of his scholarly views too bad for us and for the legal academy more generally the chilling effect on true and important scholarship that has resulted from the last few decades of obnoxious confirmation fights is quite evident in senator obamas prior silence

818136 has muns board of regents acting on the recommendation of the presidential search committee brought any names forward for cabinets the premiers consideration
818137 we have had no correspondence from the board of regents and the presidential committee
818138 the minister became aware of the short list last winter spring through routine contact with the chair of the board of regents
818139 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
818140 i put my heart and soul into the job but if i kept on going my career could have come to an abrupt end i think this decision will prolong my career
818141 i thought it might be time to go in new zealand where my body was working well but my mind was not working well i will always cherish the support ive had but this is a weight off my shoulders
818142 i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
818143 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
818144 i also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen i can be ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and i hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the england team
818145 id like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have always been so supportive and have provided a huge inspiration to me as captain a captain is only as good as his teams and ive been fortunate enough to captain some terrific players and great blokes
818146 hes led from the front and always led with integrity and honesty hes been the best possible ambassador for the england cricket team
818147 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
818148 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
818149 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level
818150 and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
818151 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the teams which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
818152 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team across all forms of the game vaughn is a classy guy
818153 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude

818423 the new testament predicts that the church throughout its history will witness many antichrists matt 24 5 23 24 mark 13 6 21 22 luke 21 8 1 john 2 18 22 4 3 2 john 7 all false teachers who teach contrary to christs word are opponents of christ and insofar as they do so are anti christ
818424 that justifying faith is nothing else than trust in divine mercy which remits sins for christs sake or that it is that trust alone by which we are justified
818425 it is rightly stated that there is a consensus in fundamental truths of the doctrine of justification
818426 is an indispensable criterion which constantly serves to orient all the teaching and practice of our churches to christ
818427 according to scripture and already from the time of the fathers of the church the message of justification has been organically integrated into the fundamental criterion of the regula fidei that is the confession of the one god in three persons christologically centered and rooted in the living church and its sacramental

818431 if any one saith that by faith alone the impious is justified in such wise as to mean that nothing else is required to co operate in order to the obtaining the grace of justification and that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will let him be anathema
818432 if any one shall say that justifying faith is nothing else than confidence in the divine mercy pardoning sins for christs sake or that it is that confidence alone by which we are justified let him be accursed
818433 if any one saith that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified or that no one is truly justified but he who believes himself justified and that by this faith alone absolution and justification are effected let him be anathema
818434 if any one saith that the justice received is not preserved and also increased before god through good works but that the said works are merely the fruits and signs of justification obtained but not a cause of the increase thereof let him be anathema
818435 if any one saith that after the grace of justification has been received to every penitent sinner the guilt is remitted and the debt of eternal punishment is blotted out in such wise that there remains not any debt of temporal punishment to be discharged either in this world or in the next in purgatory before the entrance to the kingdom of heaven can be opened to him let him be anathema
818436 if any one saith that by the catholic doctrine touching justification by this holy synod inset forth in this present decree the glory of god or the merits of our lord jesus christ are in any way derogated from and not rather that the truth of our faith and the glory in fine of god and of jesus christ are rendered more illustrious let him be anathema

818482 there has been a little buzz surrounding john edwards and his alleged affair
818483 because the only source has been the national enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumors or salacious speculations so i am asking you all not to blog about this topic until further notified
818484 we knew some of the other blogs wanted to write about it or were thinking about writing about it and at that point we were like you know we already have our metro desk working on a story and before we just kind of write a whole bunch of stuff about the national enquirer article why dont we give our metro desk a chance to see what they can find thats when they said ok tony why dont you write this letter to your bloggers
818485 most of the time they write about what they normally write about sometimes what ill do is give them some story ideas ill say something like you know i noticed you havent written about this yet have you noticed this or if theyre not sure about a story like some of them were with this edwards story theyll come to me and say what do you think with this specific story there were some blogs that dont normally handle politics that wanted to write about it so thats why they pitched it to me instead of writing to a couple of the bloggers i just wrote to all of them and said why dont we just hold off because all we have is this one source
818486 i was really just reminding the bloggers that they write for the la times and they happen to be using blogging as a publishing platform
818487 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper thats what i was just saying to them that until we have a better source lets hold off on being part of the speculation
818488 what i should have said is that if you find information because these are real reporters if you find any more information or if theres something thats out there that you come across put out by a more reputable source write it up and lets talk about it thats probably one thing that i wish i could have said
818489 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper
818490 apparently the los angeles times is actively investigating the john edwards story and thus far can confirm that
818491 ever since the national enquirer broke the story that former senator john edwards had visited a beverly hills hotel to meet with his alleged lover and love child there has been no shortage of accusations that mainstream media outlets were ignoring the story

818644 jeff would be out there rain or shine it didnt matter
818645 he just wasnt taking it down throwing it over his shoulders and taking it inside he was very purposeful about it
818646 as simple as it is to some people it really is a big deal he doesnt do it for an attaboy
818647 you dont hear of kids taking that kind of responsibility especially with something like that
818648 ive never been recognized for doing something as simple as that
818649 it was one of the best feelings ive had in my life
818650 when theyre coming home i wanted them to see the flag flying high
818651 the marine corps if they continue to achieve the kind of success they have had could meet their growth figures more than a year early
818652 youre over here worrying about the unknown and when you finally get to see them again all the love from when you gave birth just comes right back into your heart
818653 ive seen kids ask for their autographs because these are their heroes
818654 i know theyre tired and theyre overwhelmed but its just so good for them to know that we care and we love them for my own son my heart was going to explode
818655 what i think i learned early on is it doesnt matter how routine it is for us for these guys its their first day back on american soil in months and they need to know theyre supported and theyre loved and appreciated
818656 and its one of those things that you never grow tired of
818657 but our main goal is to get the troops through the line and get them to their flights so they can get home to their loved ones

818664 thats pretty competent basic gunnery they did and two weeks ago they couldnt do that
818665 the guys have been shooting real good the past couple of days
818666 even though we lost him and it still hurts theres a lot of pride
818667 the gift that he gave his brothers was truly that a gift
818668 the marine corps is a very tight and warm family but bath iron works had the same feel to it
818669 we went away with a sense of commitment and pride and warmth from what theyre doing
818670 i think itd be fair to say weve adopted them into the family
818671 theres not a guy that i couldnt call and theyd drop what they were doing and come and help us out
818672 theyre just as protective of my daughter as they would be of their sisters
818673 they gave dan a lot of suggestions to let her new boyfriend know that she had more brothers than he was probably aware of
818674 given the difficulty and cost of finding contacting and obtaining consent from the soldiers numerous representatives

818689 it was a very humbling experience to see how happy the people can be with so little
818690 it really made me appreciate what i have a lot more and showed me how blessed i truly am
818691 coming here and having this opportunity to bring joy to these people really made me realize how much i should appreciate the little things in life
818692 i think everyone should jump at an opportunity like this if they ever have the chance it is just an overwhelming experience

818712 is the answer to the call of local chief executives in safeguarding their areas from terrorist acts
818713 terrorism in mindanao is state initiated therefore it follows that poverty in mindanao is also caused by the arroyo government
818714 the state declared war on terror supposedly aimed to maintain peace in mindanao turned out to be a war of terror intended to protect the us and arroyos financial and political interests she deployed members of the military even in conflict free areas to silence the people who oppose her so called development projects

818868 europe is important the premier league is important the fa cup and the carling cup so we will try to win every trophy and you never know
818869 we will try to win from the first game and then see the situation we started really well and finished really well last season
818870 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition

818881 he had to take the responsibility of leading the line on his shoulders and he was awesome
818882 he played out of position a lot he played on the left and sacrificed himself so many times for the team i know the manager wants to see wayne playing in his more accustomed position just off the front maybe that will happen if we sign a striker and then youll see how dangerous he can be

818997 we are not pressuring the schools that need to be pressured
818998 if theres a school that rates high in educational impact but low on achievement maybe the school should have a summer program with those same teachers who are having such a positive impact
818999 we would have the same number of tests but information that is substantially more useful

819010 we do not waste time and effort on people who cannot help us
819011 we dont question that israel has to protect itself and that maybe it needs to find out something about a person who wants to enter our problem is that they are questioning patients about other people

819243 last night i was thinking about how i consider new york city to be one of the loneliest places in the world so many people surround me when im here but i feel more alone at times than i ever have none of these people knows me thinks about me cares about me etc new yorkers have to desperately try to stand out be an individual and not get lost in the crowd as i sometimes feel i do when im in new york but your photos dont let them do that in the darkness everything and everyone blends together and some of the individuality that the subjects of your pictures and even of new york city itself strive for is lost i love these pictures because they tell the truth but i hate these pictures because they tell the truth to be clear i dont actually hate these pictures at all i think theyre lovely i just hate they way they make me feel regardless of any of your personal intentions behind these photos for me when i look at them i am forced to see new york in the way i hate to huge empty and a little bit lonely

819271 um den frieden an der universit t nicht zu gef hrden

819275 einen alten christlichen bau als solchen aber zu erhalten und auch seine der eigentlichen bestimmung entsprechende nutzung zuzulassen scheint mir wie oben schon gesagt eine frage des kulturellen niveaus
819276 muss der bautr ger verpflichtend eine bau betriebsgenehmigung f r eine christliche kirche in seinem herkunftsland vorlegen
819277 einen alten christlichen bau als solchen aber zu erhalten und auch seine der eigentlichen bestimmung entsprechende nutzung zuzulassen
819278 einem weiteren lakmustest f r die religionsfreiheit in der t rkei
819279 in ihrer verfassung hat sich die t rkei als demokratischer sozialer und laizistischer staat proklamiert also als ein staat in dem eine strikte trennung zwischen kirche und staat verfolgt wird auch ist der islam keine staatsreligion mehr in der t rkei
819280 arrogante menschen gibt es in jeder nation das solltest du doch wissen
819281 was nun die anzahl der kirchen in der tuerkei anbelangt gibt es fuer solche dinge immer historische gruende zum beispiel auch dafuer dass es heute so wenige synagogen in deutschland gibt
819282 es ist die wirtschaft ebenso bei der zuwanderung der t rken nach deutschland wie bei der zuwanderung der deutschen nach amerika zuvor
819283 ein bekanntes beispiel f r pogrome gegen nichtmuslimische minderheiten in der t rkei fand 1955 statt in der nacht vom 6 auf den 7 september 1955 wurde das pogrom von istanbul entfacht in deren folge nahezu 100 000 christen das land verlie en und denen wie in der vergangenheit auch juden armenier und aram er zum opfer fielen ein fanatisierter mob setzte allein in istanbul 72 orthodoxe kirchen und mehr als 30 christliche schulen in brand danach sch ndete er christliche friedh fe und verw stete rund 3 500 wohnh user und mehr als 4 000 gesch fte mord vergewaltigung und schwerste menschenrechtsverletzungen kamen hinzu die polizei sah tatenlos zu
819284 f r die eu kommissionen und europ ischen regierungen ist die alarmierende situation der christlichen minderheiten vorrangig da diese durch die jungt rken
819285 im jahr 2006 startete die internationale gesellschaft f r menschenrechte einen internationalen appell unter dem motto t rkei erst die christen vertreiben dann in die eu
819286 in keiner der kirchen ist die politische einflussnahme so gross wie bei der griechisch orthodoxen
819287 da s der patriarch nach kirchlichem recht priester zugleich aber nach t rkischem recht t rkischer staatsb rger sein muss und die t rkei im ausland studierenden theologen regelm ig die staatsb rgerschaft entzieht

819297 and yes if the state supreme court overturns a conviction for some reason that does mean the execution is off the executive can halt a criminals execution but cannot carry one out
819298 no alito was right cant put the man to death while the state supreme court is still considering how to do it the federal government doesnt have the right to bypass the state court in the matter i think alito is more of a strict originalist and states rights advocate than even i hoped for
819299 were trying to mirror a more grounded reality not a heightened reality
819300 i think theres a political savvy to this show an unflinching approach to the issues of the day and an unapologetic irreverence

819320 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
819321 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
819322 in this kind of year a change election with big issues at stake that sort of campaign is not gonna be in a voice the american people can understand

819335 schefter points out that the decision isnt final and that it could change and has changed already as of right now however favres inclination is to take the money and not run or throw

819346 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
819347 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
819348 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
819349 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
819350 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
819351 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

819354 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

819357 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
819358 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
819359 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
819360 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
819361 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
819362 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

819366 children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
819367 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
819368 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
819369 however we are seriously concerned that even the projected differentials between ved bands remain too small to be effective and in consequence the projected carbon savings are far less than they could be we also believe that both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
819370 the government has not succeeded in tackling inequality and educational failure
819371 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
819372 david cameron has already said he cannot guarantee the future of emas under a future conservative government and this latest attempt by michael gove to undermine them suggests they have a secret plan to cut this vital support for students on low and middle incomes
819373 as an independent evaluation from the institute for fiscal studies showed earlier this year ema has been a real success with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to stay on in education at 16 as a direct result
819374 we will build on this success and from next month every young person on ema will get a firm guarantee of financial support if they go on to university

819408 why is he writing about this this is personal shit that he should keep to himself
819409 it was under a rock we got two of them
819410 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
819411 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
819412 this suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
819413 they were under a lot of pressure critics were firing up especially one on one ted and deansy
819414 so our coaches thats our family too we had to do it for them
819415 that feeling last week in sydney wasnt too pretty personally
819416 we pretty much set a standard that we were going to get up and that we were going to do it for each other and do it for the coaches
819417 im pretty happy with it everyone stood up and put up their hand and played for each other
819418 i got it down definitely but i didnt know how i got there really i might have to do some more speed training
819419 i didnt think i would make it really i was in the right spot at the right time i was pretty lucky really
819420 we know we have to go over to africa its just about enjoying the moment
819421 their final words of inspiration for the all blacks before their crucial bledisloe cup test
819422 talk to each other inspire each other be positive we can win we will win
819423 i just wanna say that if you win thats great but if you lose thats fine a sentence that i learnt in the kung fu panda movie is that yesterday is a history tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift so try your best to win for nz
819424 you are more than just a rugby team and you are more than just players when you don the jersey your country is suffering in the grip of a fierce winter of despair they look to you for hope and inspiration because you are an all black
819425 do not worry it is just a game and you are merely players rugby is not a life or death situation win or lose the world will still go round the sun will still shine your mothers wives and girlfriends will still love you and you can bask in the knowledge that some of us do not even care
819426 there have been at least three marine biodiversity hotspots during the past 50 million years
819427 in each of these cases we think that the emergence of many species and their gradual dwindling can be largely explained by plate tectonics as well as climate change
819428 its clearly something we cant do anything about but the hotspot is more vulnerable than it used to be 6 or 10 million years ago
819429 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
819430 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
819431 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
819432 it acts to make you more alert keep you more awake increases your blood pressure and increases your heart rate and it does tend to offset fatigue all the things that an athlete would like to have
819433 there are a percentage of athletes who are exploiting the fact that it is now not banned and they are getting a performance advantage over their fellow competitors
819434 in some sports it may not be a good thing more is not always better
819435 its unequivocal i can send you 200 articles that show that caffeine does enhance performance
819436 i suspect that most athletes in most events other than those requiring very fine motor activity such as archery or shooting will probably taking caffeine
819437 so the argument became that two cups of coffee might put someone over the limit whos a little gymnast whereas a big weightlifter or rower might have six cups of coffee and not be over the limit yet still get some benefit
819438 so it clearly was being used way above one or two cups of social coffee before an event or over lunch
819439 it was a silly arbitrary amount anyway it wasnt based on any science
819440 its practically impossible to outlaw every naturally occurring food which contains caffeine
819441 any report of potential abuse by athletes seeking to enhance their performance is of concern to wada and will be further investigated as part of the annual update of the list
819442 you will die in 10 days if you dont repost this
819443 it was very hard for me but this is a business i had to make a business decision

819446 its a game of inches now requiring a lot bigger taller players
819447 guess what i can do almost everything but one thing i cant do is be taller
819448 at work people wont swear around me they wont talk about getting drunk if they swear they say sorry aneesa as if i am a nun it makes it easier
819449 quite a bit of ignorance as far as religion is concerned
819450 since 9 11 various sectors of media can be blamed for misrepresenting what islam is and what it stands for people with closed minds make up their minds by reading whats in the media
819451 which is like any other religion which teaches peace and harmony
819452 the purchase of five new tu 204 is also on the agenda
819453 had to rub elbows with the commoners again all day
819454 obviously theyve brought in some new players and i think their confidence is up and ours is down slightly
819455 mick jagger is actually a very good friend of mine he was married and we never had a romance in the way it was written we had a friendship at first and then he got a divorce not because of me i didnt break up his marriage
819456 this is where we are going to demonstrate our technology to the world

819458 greatpoint is showing that creative new technologies are starting to hit the big time
819459 one of our major economic challenges is the high cost of natural gas

819474 indonesia is the only country in southeast asia that has not yet ratified the fctc and the results of this poll clearly show the people of indonesia strongly support stronger tobacco control legislation
819475 with approximately 20 percent of deaths in indonesia related to tobacco now is the time for the government to take action to protect the health of its citizens
819476 it has been proven time and time again that secondhand smoke poses a serious threat to peoples health and has been shown to cause everything from lung cancer and heart disease to sudden infant death syndrome
819477 the poll shows that indonesians clearly understand this with most believing that their right to breathe smoke free air and live healthy lives is more important than allowing smoking in public the only way to provide effective protection from secondhand smoke is by requiring smoke free public places
819478 it is estimated that smokers of 1 5 packs of cigarettes a day are exposed to as much radiation as they would receive from 300 chest x rays a year po 210 has been estimated to be responsible for 1 of all u s lung cancers po 210 may be responsible for more than 1 600 deaths in the united states and 11 700 deaths in the world each year
819479 this study provides another important example of how tobacco companies willfully mislead the public about the dangers of their deadly products and cannot be trusted to tell the truth about their products
819480 the bottom line is that smoking kills and before taking a puff people deserve accurate information about the many poisons in cigarettes including radioactive polonium 210 and the many diseases caused by tobacco use governments must take action to protect their citizens from this deception
819481 waking a sleeping giant the tobacco industrys response to the polonium 210 issue
819482 continue to minimize its importance in smoking and health litigation and remain silent on their web sites and in their messages to consumers
819483 if this proposal goes into effect it will prohibit the use of these misleading numbers and the false marketing behind light and low cigarettes
819484 the proposal will provide further momentum for other countries to reject the iso standards on tar and nicotine levels making it more difficult for the tobacco industry to make fraudulent and misleading claims about the safety of light or low tar cigarettes
819485 smoking can cause cancer heart attacks impotence and harm pregnancy and fetal development
819486 smoking can cause cancer heart attacks impotence and harm pregnancy and fetal development
819487 we call on you to put the health of indonesias children first and either require the withdrawal of all tobacco industry sponsorship from this concert or cancel your appearance we also hope you will speak out publicly about your concern for the health of indonesias children and against tobacco industry use of musicians and artists to promote their products
819488 it is a cynical company with no moral compass that would engage in these practices the sponsorship and promotion of the alicia keys concert in indonesia on its face appears to be a demonstration that philip morris international has not changed at all in its willingness to engage in whatever marketing practices it can get away with including practices that are blatantly and clearly targeted at youth in developing countries
819489 that philip morris international under your leadership is prepared to engage in marketing practices in developing nations like indonesia that you would never engage in in the united states

819502 companies like hot topic or backstreet merchandise are great firms but they represent a very small fraction of the artists out there with merch
819503 indeed most artists with merchandise will never be found in typical retail channels
819504 it is clear that digital music firms are interested in incorporating a merchandise offering but that the hard work of figuring out the market has not yet been done
819505 as i like to say the opportunity is fairly obvious but the execution is where we found things are really a mess
819506 far from regulating the tobacco industry and protecting our health the governments economic development plan lists tobacco as a top 10 industry to promote
819507 in rural and poor areas indonesians spend more money on tobacco than we do on education healthcare and any food item besides rice
819508 while up to 20 percent of deaths in indonesia are caused by tobacco each year our government is more focused on protecting the tobacco companies profits
819509 ratifying the international tobacco control treaty is one of the most important steps indonesia can take to protect the health of its citizen
819510 this lawsuit should send a strong message to indonesian government leaders the fight against the tobacco industry will not stop until strong tobacco control legislation is passed that will reduce tobacco use and save lives
819511 our government cannot stand by and do nothing while the toll tobacco takes on our economy and health becomes more and more clear
819512 children are starting to smoke as young as 5 the number of tobacco related deaths is increasing and the majority of those using tobacco live in poor areas where money would be better invested in food and education it is time for the government to pass the regulations needed to protect the health of our people
819513 laura salgado is a highly deserving first recipient of the judy wilkenfeld award she has proven herself to be a dedicated skillful tobacco control advocate and has worked in challenging circumstances to improve health and save lives laura distinctly demonstrates judys gift of uniting and mentoring people fostering consensus and nurturing those with whom she works

819557 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labour but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
819558 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
819559 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
819560 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country

819577 the relationship between the hebrews and their god during the exodus god gave them the law he led them out of egypt but the law was not binding on god
819578 its clear that for russia any formerly communist country is a threat if it opts for democracy rule of law and human rights
819579 its the first time the russians think they are powerful enough to change borders in post soviet space if they are not stopped they will go to the end
819580 it is not the signal being given but it is taken that way
819581 the united states has always been most effective when it is leading both from power and principle
819582 i dont see how the united states of america can ever back off of that commitment in the search somehow for stability which i am quite certain will be a false stability
819583 one of those critical junctures in international politics because a lot of the old bargains in the middle east have really collapsed
819584 act smartly in that new strategic context rather than being drawn back to the old strategic context in search of i think a stability that no longer exists
819585 new and much more favorable strategic context in the middle east
819586 good enough to overthrow saddam hussein and replace him with a strongman
819587 we cannot lose sight of our very real strategic national interests in this region
819588 becomes a breeding ground for exporting terrorists as it appears it already is
819589 order specialized units to engage in narrow and targeted operations against al qaeda and other terrorist organizations in the region
819590 to keep order and promote stability in the country but only to the extent we believe such training is actually working
819591 to protect the fragile but real democracy and relative peace and security that has developed there
819592 i am optimistic in the medium and long term but it needs five or six or seven or 10 years
819593 of our very real strategic national interests in this region

819599 they are dangerous and clever and good at asymmetric warfare
819600 but i think they have a lot of vulnerabilities and i think we can exploit them
819601 theres no one available at the time to answer your questions all right
819602 it does allow us to reach out to youth groups to talk to dissidents its something the regime wouldnt like
819603 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even nonexistent
819604 there has been some debate over how imminent a threat iraq poses i do believe iraq poses an imminent threat i also believe after september 11 that question is increasingly outdated to insist on further evidence could put some of our fellow americans at risk can we afford to take that chance i do not think we can
819605 the reports essentially validate what we have been saying all along that policymakers statements were substantiated by the intelligence
819606 before his grades were below average and for the first time he made the honor roll he came home he was so proud that he made the honor roll they had the awards ceremony so i wouldnt tell him i was coming when he came out he saw my husband and me sitting in the first row he gave us this big grin but to see him walk up there and receive that piece of paper i mean you could see the joy all over him
819607 this legislation represents an ominous step toward federally sponsored privatization of public education that heavily favors the wealthiest families to the detriment of the majority of public school students
819608 shes in a school where its real family oriented you know that the principal is very much involved as well as the teachers and they really do care so im happy i dont have to worry anymore about someone calling saying she got jumped or things of that nature so really im just happy

819614 the training in the past was training for trainings sake completely not linked with any real job at the end of the training
819615 mr forrest is telling us that hes going to be stomping around the big end of town and putting the wood on the packers of the world and the other big employers to say to them listen weve got to guarantee aboriginal people who successfully complete training weve got to guarantee them a job
819616 there have been big corporate drives for indigenous employment in the past but weve stopped short of guaranteeing the job
819617 it was undoubtedly an ambitious voyage but as your honour will hear it was planned for some time
819618 it may be that exactly what happened to them will remain unknown

819621 he wants to use the office to emphasize open government and preservation of public records for starters he would work to protect consumers one of his good ideas is to transfer the office of public counsel which represents consumers in utility rate matters to the attorney generals office to give it more independence

819629 the very independence that earns steelman antipathy among many organization republicans makes her the better choice for the office
819630 cannot support either of the republican candidates for governor this year
819631 its not the typical one for a politician like getting caught in a hypocrisy or flip flopping no steelmans problem has its roots in her take no prisoners style

819636 la judiciarisation des litiges est souvent pr sent e comme le produit de la tendance croissante des usagers m contents saisir le juge administratif mais le contentieux ne se r sume pas une simple contrainte externe pour ladministration dans certains cas ce sont en effet les institutions et les pratiques bureaucratiques qui influent sur le niveau du contentieux cest ce que se propose de montrer la demi journ e d tude organis e lecole normale sup rieure la suite dune tude men e dans le ressort de deux juridictions

819640 il convient donc de sinterroger cette fois ci de mani re a priori tout aussi contre intuitive sur ce qui conduit des administrations saisir le tribunal administratif pour attaquer des usagers occasion de souligner combien et pourquoi le contentieux en mati re de logement est un contentieux dorigine essentiellement administrative un produit d riv de lactivit de diff rentes administrations qui fonctionnent chacune partir de logiques relativement autonomes et qui concourent sans bien s r en faire un objectif limportance de ce contentieux et son volution en loccurrence l volution du contentieux administratif en mati re de logement est rapporter un ensemble de facteurs structurels li s au fonctionnement m me des caf en interaction avec l volution de la l gislation des attitudes des tribunaux et des relations avec la cnaf facteurs structurels qui ninterdisent toutefois pas une certaine diversit des pratiques en fonction de cultures administratives locales

819673 the numbers are alarming there is an increase of 20 per cent in the reported cases of missing children compared to last year
819674 in previous years children were reported missing on their way home from schools or after playing with friends outside their homes however
819675 i personally am not happy with this especially because they have committed acts of aggression killed iraqis and this has not been resolved yet positively for families of victims
819676 the u s government has the right to choose what contractors it chooses but iraq should also have the right to allow or ban certain contractors from operating on its territory
819677 most importantly the iraqi investigation concluded that blackwater committed a crime at nusour square
819678 the u s informed us that the fbi investigation is still not done and if blackwater personnel are convicted then the contract will be reviewed
819679 and then we decide whether it is consistent with u s goals and policies to continue the contract
819680 we can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to
819681 i am not going to prejudge what the fbi is going find in its investigation its complex i think the u s government needs protective services
819682 i am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen
819683 essentially i think they do a very good job the september 16 incident was a tragedy it needs to be investigated carefully the results of that will come out eventually and we will decide how we will proceed

819687 arent you exploiting thousands of american deaths in both this current war and 9 11 just sell a book
819688 that is my greatest consolation as we speak many people including veterans are purchasing this book witnessing the very references which prove this books biblical promises people are now witnessing biblical prophecies unfold before their eyes concerning 9 11 and iraq freed by a modern eagle amazon com just announced on their web sight that they have sold out this book and must order more
819689 there are no unsatisfied customers who complain of not receiving any thing less than was promised from the author
819690 there are steady reports of people finding far more than what they ever expected possible it would be unforgivable for any author to promise people something to exploit a national tragedy for book sales
819691 i have four children of my own if my book were to become exposed as a manipulation of biblical text such would forever mark my childrens name as well as my own
819692 reading this particular book has made me aware of how christians have come to accept biblical spin and less than honest interpretations when reading books on bible prophecy

819695 during the nearly 4 years of war the department of justice has failed to move aggressively enough in prosecuting fraud in iraq today the inspectors general before us have opened hundreds of investigations but so far the u s justice department has only brought eight criminal cases involving 25 individuals over the last 3 years the crimes in a number of these cases were committed by employees of kellogg brown amp root one of the largest contractors in iraq as i said a wholly owned subsidiary of halliburton in these cases the employees have admitted to receiving kickbacks inflating costs embezzling money and stealing millions from the american people but so far the justice department has brought no legal action civil or criminal against kbr or halliburton
819696 the republican run doj deliberately bottleneck cases that would be harmful to their corporate contributors
819697 last september senator leahy asked why the justice department was not intervening in this category of cases were still waiting for the answer that we all know because the orgy of greed and war profiteering are being enjoyed by friends of the bush administration like halliburton and kbr
819698 i really want to stress what i feel is most important that somebody notifies all the soldiers and contractors who were exposed to this dangerous water at the various bases in iraq
819699 i waited silently for the doj to bring halliburton into court and demand a refund for all the money they had billed our government for providing unsafe water to our troops only to have the doj file motions for extensions month after month i guess what im getting at is this if the doj wont protect the united states government and taxpayers from halliburton who will

819762 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
819763 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed

819771 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
819772 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
819773 im a man i take my consequences i know what i did i think i did the right thing
819774 i wonder why a guy plate umpire tim timmons thought we were going to hit the guy with the bases loaded with a pitch in on the hands this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
819775 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it ill bring octavio dotel ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business

819778 i was just standing on the mound and the umpire came up to me and said youre out of here they might think there is something stemming from before but i didnt think i was being thrown out of the game obviously they thought differently and they make the call
819779 we dont play like that ozzie doesnt play like that this team doesnt play like that

819792 when you hit times like this and reflect back you realize the nfl is bigger than everybody this situation is bigger than everybody its about the national football league then its about the green bay packers and finally its about the individuals i think thats very important and when that gets out of balance problems occur
819793 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically

819801 elite performers in many diverse domains have been found to practice on the average roughly the same amount every day including weekends
819802 if i dont practice for a day i know it if i dont practice for two days my wife knows it if i dont practice for three days the world knows it

819866 i dont know why i make my life so complicated
819867 i had one of those once in high school the pain was indescribable every time i took a wiz i wanted to kill myself
819868 everythings fine im just trying to stay out of trouble ive already gotten a lecture about our behavior
819869 if either of us were in here sucking face with a date they wouldnt say anything
819870 dont worry about it this was a last minute thing i was going to leave them after the movie but i figured youre the one guy i know who wouldnt lose his shit and she thinks youre great so obviously i wasnt mistaken
819871 the two of you are getting bad man in trouble
819872 dont talk to the cbc even if you know anything
819873 the western media are naturally unreliable and they are always looking for chances to bash the chinese dont fall into their trap
819874 if you have watched the interview of the dalai lama aired on the cbc recently and realized how biased it is you wouldnt even think of talking to anyone from cbc
819875 once you know about this its only logical that youd do anything to prevent it
819876 its true that cotton isnt all that natural there are indications that when the agricultural chemicals used in cotton production come into contact with sweat they can irritate the skin and yet cotton is a pleasant fabric it feels nicer on the skin than synthetics in adult fashion synthetic fabrics are its competition but with babies and childrens clothing theres hardly any demand for materials other than cotton and of course organic cotton is a pure product for the environment and also for your skin
819877 yes the dyes and the prints we use contain toxins there simply arent any high quality natural alternatives natural pastel shades are available but we want color were spoiled
819878 undyed clothing is boring but we use dyes that have the lowest possible impact on the environment
819879 tragic every brand skimps on labour costs so youve got overcrowded unlit factories child labour bad sleeping accommodations for the cotton pickers the list goes on its a miserable existence for the workers
819880 its not that straightforward when you get to know those countries a little better you can see those circumstances in context you cant bring everything up all at once to the level were used to imps amp elfs only works with factories that have an sa8000 certificate which guarantees employees certain basic rights such as the right to an independent trade union and safe conditions and forbids child labour and sex discrimination
819881 its not always easy and thats logical there are different interests the production department wants the smoothest possible production process the salespeople want to sell as much as they can those interests do sometimes clash with our ecological and social principles also everything always has to get cheaper production has to economize customers want to pay less youre constantly running up against that thats how it is running a responsible company day to day
819882 and yet i also see those choices as a selling point i believe consumer awareness is changing i see babies and childrens clothing as a good vehicle for informing people about organic materials and responsible production
819883 when youve just brought a child into the world youre occupied with that new life in a very focused conscious way what kind of world is that child going to grow up in when i lived in hong kong i wasnt so socially motivated but when i became a father that changed its not a coincidence that imps amp elfs was born the same year as my eldest daughter
