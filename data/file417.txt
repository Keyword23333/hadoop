4170119 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4170120 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4170121 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4170122 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4170123 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4170124 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4170125 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4170126 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4170127 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4170128 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4170129 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4170130 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4170131 state senator involved in controversy over condos in danger of collapse
4170132 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4170133 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4170174 love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken
4170175 love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than robert redford
4170176 love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day
4170177 i know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones
4170178 when you love somebody your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you
4170179 love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesnt think its gross
4170180 you really shouldnt say i love you unless you mean it but if you mean it you should say it a lot people forget
4170181 es ist durchaus m glich dass nelson am samstag in leverkusen spielen kann
4170182 ich h tte gerne einen spielenden st rmer und einen explosiven dabei
4170183 ich gehe zun chst mal davon aus dass nelson spielen kann
4170184 er wird sich in den n chsten tagen einigen tests unterziehen
4170185 as many of you may know from experience when you are married for a long time and it ends badly it feels good to clean house and get rid of reminders of times with that person and start over again
4170186 almost everything was a reminder in some way or another plus there was a lot of stuff left behind by that person
4170187 i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasize that by doing odd things
4170188 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes i was clumsy and awkward when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4170189 when i went with my parents and brother to see
4170190 its not really racing its just you taking your bitchen car and racing around europe
4170191 is there ever really a reason to pull it shut
4170192 how do we teach people to turn off the lights after they leave a room
4170193 i refuse to believe it is too much to ask from adults
4170194 you dont have to be raised by gentry to understand these basic concepts people
4170195 its categorized as non fiction however 50 of it is totally true
4170196 unless it in insanely egregious comedians should get a pass to say whatever the hell they want
4170197 two years in the court system fighting over child support thanks for bringing it up t
4170198 choose a donation button to copy to your website optional
4170199 frankly we were blown away by both the volume and quality of the names that were submitted
4170200 g8 st was one of the most popular suggestions plus we noticed a far broader trend toward simple easy to remember names
4170201 in the end we felt it was more appropriate to honor the el caminos unique place as part of chevys heritage and not use that nameplate on a pontiac
4170202 one 1 grand prize 2010 pontiac g8 sport truck the actual name of which has yet to be determined
4170203 the approximate retail value of the grand prize is no less than 27 595 and is based on the projected manufacturers suggested retail price msrp of a 2008 pontiac g8 sedan
4170204 i think its only natural that parents are going to act that way initially
4170205 youre talking about something that is probably the most important thing in their life indirectly theyre threatened because their kids have been threatened
4170206 let the kids know that what the teacher has written is important enough for you to read carefully
4170207 going directly to a classroom to question a teacher pulls time away from instruction goes against most school visitation policies and can cause a parent to be permanently banned from being on campus
4170208 you dont want to get in trouble so you dont exactly lie but you dont exactly tell the story as it was
4170209 the teacher said i just thought i knew nancy well enough to tease her she didnt realize that nancy was interpreting it that way
4170210 i always say i dont care what they say about me the first day of school but what they say about me at the last day of school
4170211 if the teacher thinks differently than your parental philosophy your child is learning more than you can teach her
4170212 if something doesnt feel right take it to the principal and ask that they conduct an investigation
4170213 give the school a chance to get to the bottom of the situation and find a solution
4170214 girls here i know are 510 and size 0 i dont think anybodys body is naturally like that
4170215 at some point youve got to exhibit maturity and restraint and i do that constantly
4170216 he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4170217 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up
4170218 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4170219 passiamo sempre pi tempo alle prese con gli strumenti di comunicazione per i quali spendiamo sempre meno
4170220 its quite a compelling activity i didnt like being retired at all
4170221 people will wonder how can i think about going back to that if i was a golfer people wouldnt raise their eyebrows its just dangerous period
4170222 it always was and always will be and you have to be a little bit selfish to do this
4170223 im only returning because its a vocation i wouldnt like to get 10 years down the line when im genuinely too old
4170224 ive probably got more butterflies because i know people are looking at me will he need a walking stick to get across the ring
4170225 hes very down to earth and theres no airs and graces
4170226 the assumption is that inflation is not going to be a concern going forward
4170227 the market thinks that the fed is out of the picture
4170228 and we believe a strong movie deserves a strong playdate
4170229 there were several drivers behind this latest release including significant client input our continued mission to improve software interfaces and ease of use and a focus on delivering technology that provides an obvious return on investment
4170230 equally important several of these new capabilities will open new markets for partners and us particularly with those enterprises seeking to instantiate best practices across their organizations
4170231 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4170232 the challenge for many sellers is determining the right price for todays market conditions there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from record sales and price increase levels of 2007
4170233 this does obviously go against the move of restraining demand but that has been accommodated by a relatively tight monetary stance
4170234 unlike the private sector government staff dont get productivity increases as each year goes by you have to do it through this massive exercise
4170235 its almost cocktail and i dont know if its day enough but its absolutely beautiful
4170236 between the two of you i think you got something really great
4170237 the shape is unfortunate it looks so much cheaper than i thought it would look
4170238 i am concerned with the question of taste because you cant get taste if you dont have it
4170239 welcomed the resilience of the indonesian economy to the global slowdown and financial market turmoil underpinned by strong macroeconomic fundamentals and the highly liquid and well capitalised banking system
4170240 if this rising investment cycle picks up indonesia has the potential for insular growth that will set it apart from its neighbours
4170241 the growth momentum is very strong and the upward trend on employment and poverty reduction is healthy
4170242 the main worry is inflation it will be a couple of months before the central bank and we get it down to single digits again
4170243 we are pleased to have sold this non dilutive form of regulatory capital which will return us to a well capitalized status market conditions are tightening daily and we are glad to have this behind us

4170260 uniquely positioning the company to capitalize on our global product portfolio especially small cars
4170261 ford already delivers the best small cars in europe now its north americas turn and we intend to deliver these small cars profitably
4170262 the company will continue to manage its costs responsibly and improve production efficiencies where possible
4170263 during the second quarter the company reduced production and research and development staff to core levels reduced utive compensation and continues to review supplier alternatives
4170264 i was more nervous than i have ever been ahead of the heat and was disappointed with the way i swam but in my heart of hearts i knew i wasnt capable of winning a medal
4170265 in the warm up i felt awful in the sprints i felt ok but back in there i was just awful
4170266 it was a wonderful honour to carry the flag at the opening ceremony it was possibly the olympic medal for me ive always missed but ive been waiting to get out there and race
4170267 jemma doesnt want to know her results until she gets back from the olympics ive been told to go and pick up her results from school but not to open the envelope
4170268 you know i know it rained the first day but quite honestly i dont understand why we play such a big tournament over 10 days
4170269 according to the investigation the van was at fault and violated traffic rules
4170270 there were a lot of people talking bad about us about how the training camp was a disaster and the high performance programme was no good and theres too much training being done its all a load of rubbish
4170271 ill go back to the team now with another win theres a load of lads into the last eight or the last 16 and things are definitely on the up there is pressure on me to get a medal now but i will just treat it as another fight
4170272 the fortune teller told me if you change your name you will win the gold
4170273 the points didnt go for me today in the last round i knew i wouldnt get the decision unless i knocked him out the scoring here is so bad for an olympic games its unbelievable
4170274 carbon cred works much like a supermarket loyalty card but the rewards are much more far reaching the points you earn can be used to buy green lifestyle products and services to cut your personal co2 emissions
4170275 for example if you were to buy a laptop you earn 35 carbon credits check out the website and youll see that with those credits youd be able to get a freeplay led lantern power chimp mobile phone charger several energy saving lightbulbs a freeloader charger or any other item listed at 35 credits and below earn more credits and the eco friendly gifts get bigger
4170276 after posting disappointing results in our second quarter we made it clear that we would take immediate action to reduce costs and simplify our business and during the third quarter thats exactly what we did
4170277 our results do not yet reflect the impact of the changes we have made however i believe that we have created a more nimble organization that will benefit our financial performance moving forward
4170278 provide any tangible benefit for people who are exposed to germs in crowded places
4170279 that the key ingredients found in airborne will help support a healthy immune system
4170280 were just one of many major consumer brands across america that are under assault by class action lawyers
4170281 while we continued to do a good job containing our operating costs the second quarter was disappointing from a revenue perspective
4170282 due to phone model changeovers two of our larger customers reported lower royalties than in previous quarters
4170283 esquires coffee houses has introduced a new reusable cup sleeve for its take away drinks made from 100 per cent recycled paper in a bid to reduce waste
4170284 to ensure customers reuse their cup sleeves esquires coffee houses has launched a loyalty scheme where the customers who reuse their cup sleeve nine times will be rewarded with a free drink on their 10th visit
4170285 the new sleeve uses a simple concept that has tremendous potential for reducing the waste produced by the takeaway trade i can only hope other chains will adopt similar initiatives in the near future
4170286 as expected the seasonally stronger second quarter resulted in occupancy increases levering our increased rental rates and improving our operating margins
4170287 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets
4170288 while inflation and higher fuel costs are pressuring suppliers retailers and customers worldwide were confident that wal mart is well positioned for this economy
4170289 wal mart continues to execute well and deliver solid results in a challenging economic environment
4170290 financial markets had a positive impact on the investment portfolio overall this quarter as canadian equity markets rose 8 6 per cent on the strength of higher commodity prices and energy stocks
4170291 well above the 4 2 per cent real return required to sustain the canada pension plan at its current contribution rate
4170292 there arent any real rules or guidelines for the process but its plausible it could get approved under the current administration
4170293 the facts are what they are and the facts are on our side
4170294 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4170295 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4170296 in 1994 liu zheng began photographing moments in which archetypal chinese figures are encountered in contemporary incarnations and often in extreme and unexpected situations the resulting series the chinese portrays a society wrestling with the contradictions between traditional culture and modernization the series presents a broad cross section of society including the wealthy the poor transsexuals coal miners opera performers as well as waxwork figures in historical museums from 1991 to 1997 zheng worked as a photojournalist for workers daily one of chinas most widely distributed newspapers in a culture where photography was historically linked with political propaganda and communist ideology rather than a documentary tradition that equated photography with truth he began work on the chinese during an explosive period of change and growth in the contemporary art scene in china catalyzed by national policies of reform drawing on his background zheng utilizes photography as a tool for constructing false reality the lighting and poses in these square format photographs all appear candid but in fact staged tableaux and spontaneous images coexist in the series influenced by both diane arbus and august sander the chinese presents the viewer with a personalized study of chinese culture concentrating on the dark side of its psychology through his photographs zheng performs an intricate balancing act between harsh reality and romanticism between engagement and detachment seeking to reconstitute chinese history in the process
4170297 an agreement for best buy to start selling iphones will help make already strong estimates for apples device sales seem all too modest according to an investment note from lehman brothers
4170298 analyst ben reitzes determines that the large increase in the number of american distribution points that comes with the best buy initiative combined with more than one million iphones sold on the launch weekend alone should result in apple blowing past earlier predictions for the rest of calendar 2008
4170299 we believe our estimate of 3 8 million iphones sold in apple s september quarter is very conservative reitzes says furthermore we believe that initial demand overseas is very strong and will get much stronger we estimate at least 8 3 million iphones could be sold in the december quarter equating to 12 1 million of the new devices trading hands during the summer and fall combined
4170300 we dont like to see advertising that lends itself to vandalize the system
4170301 and although he had full knowledge that the ads would probably be rejected by their own standards
4170302 this is information about a ballistic missile attack this area is being targeted for attack
4170303 portsmouth fc and players agent willie mckay have been charged with breaches of fa rules connected to the transfer of benjani mwaruwari to and from the club
4170304 under the fas football agents regulations agents are prohibited from acting for two different clubs in two consecutive transactions involving the same player clubs are not allowed to use the services of an agent in such circumstances
4170305 it is alleged that mckay acted on behalf of aj auxerre in respect of the transfer of benjani from auxerre to portsmouth in january 2006 and then on behalf of portsmouth in respect of benjanis transfer from portsmouth to manchester city in january 2008 which was the immediately subsequent completed transaction involving the player
4170306 my story continues for those who are interested i think we will have a final decision in the coming days
4170307 i do not like to talk about processes we will only say that we do not rule out a move
4170308 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4170309 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is august 31
4170310 the hispanic consumer wants what everyone else wants in a bank
4170311 inflation is on the higher side and it should peak at 13 5 percent by mid december the best case scenario is 9 5 percent by end march
4170312 the tightening bias of the reserve bank of india should stay
4170313 its a great time to give the guys a break and give them time to re focus on the remainder of fall camp
4170314 the players have done exactly what we have asked them to do i think this provides them a great opportunity to sharpen their focus and prepare for the final eight days of fall camp and then to begin preparing for our first opponent
4170315 in a pandemic which has been dubbed apian flu and mad bee disease there is no shortage of suspects parasites viruses pesticides climate change gm crops and even radiation from mobile phones interfering with bee navigation these have all been cited as the main culprit but without evidence these remain simply theories
4170316 well it looks like i am going to have to tell you it is hold on is that one last little hand i see still up over there in the corner and what is your name then
4170317 ok albert and what do you think it might be then
4170318 go on albert tell us how bees could possibly bring down the human race
4170319 if the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe then man would have only four years of life left no more bees no more pollination no more plants no more animals no more life
4170320 quiet the rest of you can all stop laughing because albert is absolutely right well done boy keep this up and you could make a bit of a name for yourself in biology whats that you say albert physics no stick to what you are good at that is my advice
4170321 this is not an issue of asking them to do more work just to share the information with the public that they already have
4170322 andy johnson will not be able to feature because he had a thigh strain when he came to the club and we dont want to take the risk with that although im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal the following week
4170323 when we started our negotiations he had taken part in a shooting practice at everton just before they left for america and got a strain in his left thigh
4170324 then the problem was that during the negotiations there was a break in the treatment which wasnt advantageous because we werent allowed to treat him
4170325 we started to treat him as soon as we could which was four or five days after the incident but that unfortunately has cost us a week
4170326 had he had continuous treatment im sure he would have been fit for this week but unfortunately that hiatus has cost us
4170327 i have no idea where that story has come from no one has approached us about paul konchesky because it is pretty obvious to everyone we are not interested in the slightest about selling paul konchesky
4170328 and if i was paul konchesky i would be very sad to see my name linked with a 2m transfer when i am a player who is worth a lot more than that
4170329 god only knows where that has come from there must be a reason for it someone must have an agenda and is using pauls name to further it
4170330 paul konchesky is not for sale he is our star left back
4170331 his name has never even been mentioned in the eight months i have been at this club
4170332 based on the records that we have it appears that there was no contamination
4170333 looking further into the records we had a permit that was issued
4170334 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4170335 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4170336 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4170337 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4170338 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4170339 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4170340 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4170341 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4170342 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us
4170343 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
4170344 les agradezco a ellos interscoupe que hayan tenido la visi n de dejarme trabajar el mercado latino sin intervenir mi contrato con ellos es por un disco m s y creo que estar trabajando en eso para el 2009
4170345 hoy en d a no se venden los discos que se vend an hace cinco a os por eso hemos tratado de enfocarnos en otros proyectos tecnol gicos para empatar la pelea
4170346 gracias a todos por el apoyo de todo coraz n gracias mis respetos para todos los compadres y para todas las ladies gracias una vez m s por el apoyo y los quiero mucho
4170347 completely automated public turing test to tell computer and humans apart
4170348 the georgian soldiers had been guarding irans border with iraq
4170349 this will put new pressure on the united states and iraq and in the meantime make it easier for the people who want to cross the border from iran
4170350 they are convinced that russia will not help the united states at the u n security council in getting a new sanctions resolution
4170351 they put together a country operational plan at the beginning of each fiscal year that describes how theyre going to spend that years funding
4170352 fdas only public comment at this time is to acknowledge that ranbaxy is under investigation
4170353 the blogosphere influenced me im out there every day getting hits watching my memes propagate
4170354 people really do care about tagging they really do tag when they get an immediate positive result
4170355 theyre going to anyhow if they want to load bad data into their database they can
4170356 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
4170357 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
4170358 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4170359 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4170360 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
4170361 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
4170362 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them
4170363 maybe one day id write a song and somebody would sing it and then no one would really know that i wrote it
4170364 it would be kind of exciting and i had heard that prince did that and it was just kind of a goal for me
4170365 in marxs bizarre world truth is whatever individuals and communities acting in defense of their interests say it is
4170366 it is this wondrous proposition that truth doesnt exist which holds all the pieces of dr marxs elaborate theory together
4170367 yet he hasnt offered us one scintilla of empirical evidence in its support
4170368 like the great majority of people no doubt like most of you i place marxs amazing hypothesis about the non existence of truth in the same category as a belief the moons inhabited or that planet earth is flat
4170369 science he forgets is based upon the conviction objective truths exist independently of what anyone might want and that its a scientists obligation to determine what they are
4170370 adopting marxs peculiar theory would not only mean abandoning science it would mean discarding its universally spoken language as well
4170371 science honors geniuses individuals who discover fundamentally important features geniuses objective and impartial understandings
4170372 one is left wondering what marx intends when he speaks of what does he suppose an idea which isnt fantasy or myth is if its not an idea thats objectively true
4170373 but central to the belief that reality and our consciousness of it are
4170374 dr marxs paradigm literally makes my head spin and i suspect your head may be spinning too
4170375 to begin with lacking any empirical evidence how the first homo sapien communities thought we can only speculate however i find it reasonable to suppose that like hunters and gatherers today they had voodooists shamans and medicine men whose principal function was to discover the truth however convinced you and i may be that they often failed at the endeavor
4170376 they were religious communities and a belief in objective truth has always been a pivotal feature of holy bible god commanded adam and eve not to eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil truly good and what was truly evil
4170377 when satan told adam and eve if they ignored gods proscription and ate the forbidden fruit they would he wasnt proposing theyd acquire the ability to differentiate between good and evil thats a faculty christianity like other faiths grants to everyone choosing good over evil is considered critical for christians if they would enter into the kingdom of heaven
4170378 capitalist country scientists generally distinguish their industrial world metaphysics from those of nomadic slave and feudal states by proposing
4170379 however unlike dr marx they do not dispute that values too have observer independent objective dimensions
4170380 common sense tells us if they didnt we would not be able to identify them or give them names or point to instances of their application
4170381 marx and i are agreed then that both the values and the interpretations of fact of communities with clashing economic social and political interests will also be in conflict
4170382 where we disagree is that marx proposes all fact value understandings are equally valid and cannot be given an authoritative justification
4170383 being a scientist who believes in objective truth i hold that the facts and values of individuals and communities can be dispassionately identified then defended or opposed
4170384 as i emphasized in my opening remarks an objective look at the world reveals the primary value of a leader is the preservation of his state upon which the lives and well being of his people depend
4170385 which is why i endorse the current u s foreign policy
4170386 no other country has so faithfully defended the democratic values spelled out in the american bill of rights freedom of speech religion and assembly freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures the right to bear arms and the right to a speedy trial by a jury of ones peers when accused of a crime
4170387 understand while i believe it to be wrong i recognize his reasoning is logically consistent just as i recognize ptolemys reasoning about the physical universe was logically consistent but wrong
4170388 google copernicus and youll discover there are still ptolemaists as remarkably there are still a few people who believe earth is flat
4170389 however scientists understand that the ptolemaic system like the flat earth theory
4170390 consider then a few of the empirically indefensible conclusions marx syllogistically drew from his bizarre metaphysics
4170391 having convinced himself all socio economic political consciousness is defensively created accepted modified or rejected it followed that classes are but communities of people who find maintaining their social existence requires them to join forces and deny other communities of individuals the opportunity to do the same
4170392 according to dr marxs relativistic metaphysics if you tell a peasant a worker or a capitalist hes a member of a class and he rejects your designation it is his very rejection tells you that under existing circumstances for him to battle as a member of a peasantry a working or a capitalist class is not the least disruptive way to preserve his social existence
4170393 in writing and in speeches marx quite logically directed his most aggressive attacks not against feudal lords or capitalists but against proudhon feuerbach left hegelians and other absolutist liberals who treating ideas and reality as independent of one another proposed to rescue the masses by bringing them something herr marx argues does not exist
4170394 since the young hegelians consider conceptions thoughts ideas in fact all the products of consciousness to which they attribute an independent existence as the real chains of men the young hegelians have to fight only against these illustions of the consciousness
4170395 marx insisted the masses would acquire an egalitarian consciousness only when defending their social existence made it imperative for them to do so
4170396 on the other hand being a utopian idealist he deemed that magical situation was at hand
4170397 the capitalist order of production and distribution was nearly drained of viability dr marx reasoned and workers would soon find themselves in the desperate circumstances which would turn them into a class
4170398 to quote his wildly exaggerated description of the mid 19
4170399 along with the constantly diminishing number of magnates of capital who usurp and monopolize all advantages of this process of transformation grows the mass of misery oppression slavery degradation exploitation but with this too grows the revolt of the working class a class always increasing in numbers and disciplined united organized by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself
4170400 after becoming a unified proletariat marx enthused the workers were going to raze the capitalist productive distributive system then they would build an egalitarian order in its place
4170401 and they would do these things not because someone won them over to a revolutionary consciousness by bringing them they would do them because they had to in order to survive
4170402 i t becomes evident he again very logically but also very mistakenly concluded that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an overriding law because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery
4170403 i suppose if youre a diehard supporter of dr marxs distorted logic you might protest it was nevertheless found
4170404 consider the fate of marxs linchpin proposition respecting the nonexistence of truth
4170405 in the late 1800s alexander bogdanov a philosopher a physician and a prominent member of the bolshevik party began promoting that epistemological nonsense in russia
4170406 bogdanov argued his relativistic machian interpretation of marxs theory he called it emperiomonism was correct writing three volumes on the subject by the early 1900s bogdanovs popularity among bolshevik leaders had become second only to lenins
4170407 bogdanov the relativist was expelled from the bolshevik party in 1909 and played no role in the russian revolution
4170408 in brief in order to give dr marxs theory relevance lenin had to turn it back into the very kind of objectivist logic marx himself had railed against
4170409 in 1903 fourteen years before the russian revolution lenin wrote
4170410 the history of all countries bears witness that by its own resources alone the working class is in a position to generate only a trade union consciousness
4170411 post 1917 lenins objectivist marxism became to use marxs own terminology the spiritual quintessence of the soviet unions self understanding reality possessed an observer independent form soviet leaders thereafter contended a form which using their absolutist interpretation of marxs arguments their ideas would reflect
4170412 during and after chinas revolution mao tse tung and other chinese communist party leaders embraced the same objectivist dare i say deformation of dr marxs theory
4170413 of course i vigorously disagree with most leninist and maoist depictions of socio economic political reality but at least russian and chinese leaders have had the intelligence to recognize reality exists
4170414 what then has been the fate of dr marxs theory in the west
4170415 with very few exceptions western marxists have given their high priests ideas the same absolutist construction it received in the east
4170416 george novack a popular american trotskyist wrote an entire book distinguishing his marxist conviction truths are demonstrably anchored in objective reality from pragmatist philosopher john deweys view that they are merely utilitarian constructs
4170417 respecting dr marxs most passionate anti objectivist arguments western marxists often felt it was important to explain he hadnt really intended them to be interpreted that way
4170418 it would be a mistake to classify marx as no more than a relativist
4170419 louis althusser a french philosopher who from the late 1960s to the early 1980s spoke for much of the left in france and italy carried the objectivist understanding of marxism further
4170420 perhaps finding it difficult to reconcile the relativism manifest in dr marxs writing with his own absolutist perspective althusser decided most of marxs theory remained to be formulated
4170421 w e so miss the dialectics which marx did not need and which he refused us
4170422 even more problematic althusser proposed marx himself often failed to think like a marxist
4170423 hegel reasoned history moves because communities of people come up with new ideas which prompt them to alter their behavior consciousness leads experience
4170424 he had the process upside down marx insisted history moves because communities of people discover they must formulate then act upon new strategies in order to maintain their social existence consciousness including revolutionary consciousness never leads it follows
4170425 the existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class
4170426 as for marxs eloquent relativistic observations in his one day we will have to show that these eleven deceptively transparent theses are really riddles
4170427 althusser also took a swipe at two prominent european philosophers who were viewing marxs arguments through a relativistic prism writing
4170428 marxist scientists althusser counselled must concentrate on identifying the objectively inessential components of the historical process then isolate the latter in order to understand the former more fully
4170429 since marx had not provided adequate instructions for accomplishing this critical task althusser advised marxists they would need to in carrying out their investigations
4170430 to sum its objectively obvious that with few exceptions marxist political leaders and political theorists east and west have ignored the very essence of dr marxs theory that relativistic epistemological glue which holds all his axioms together
4170431 now id like you to answer a simple question if a self styled meteorologist
4170432 dr marx made that most rudimentary of mistakes the one we scientists continually warn against he allowed his personal values to distort his reading of the world
4170433 more than 160 years have passed since herr marx made his failed predictions unfortunately idealists seem to be unruffled when the world doesnt conform with their analyses and marx has said nothing this evening which suggests hes having second thoughts
4170434 he still proposes realitys form is creative that political theories become true insofar as they constitute the least painful and disruptive strategies for maintaining the social existence of the individuals and communities who call them that
4170435 since the u s war in iraq is the main subject of this debate id now like to direct your attention to the present objective situation respecting the war then ill explain why it is that objective situation exists
4170436 as you know for the past several months the number of u
4170437 polls show the majority of americans agree with mccains blithe appraisal that is they agree to talk of empirical fact that iraqs infrastructure and economy have been destroyed over a million iraqis have been killed 6 million have been severely wounded and 4 million more have been driven from their homes
4170438 imagine that a war occurred here in the united states in which americans suffered a proportionate loss the nations infrastructure highways hospitals power plants bridges and waste disposal systems would be destroyed streams lakes and rivers would be badly polluted eleven million americans would be dead 66 million gravely injured in addition 44 million americans would have been driven from their homes 22 million of them exiled from the country
4170439 is it not obvious to you no people has ever declared
4170440 this is the maximum number of children our consciences will permit us to slaughter this the upper most number of women and old people we would ever terrorize maim or kill this the greatest number of innocent peoples homes we could justify destroying this the largest number of their hospitals we would bomb this the greatest number of their lakes rivers and streams we would pollute beyond these stated limits we will never go
4170441 today americans british iraqis afghanis pakistanis and others are doing it all over again in the middle east
4170442 moreover thousands of years of human history objectively prove our nature as to change the nature of a hippopotomus a pine tree or a stone
4170443 stalinist russia and maoist china gave brutal demonstrations that movements which attempt to do it cause more suffering not less
4170444 im not suggesting leaders shouldnt strive to be good and to make their people good
4170445 but it is critical for him to understand that in the endless struggle between good and evil he will never confront a clear and unqualified choice between the two
4170446 he will always be forced to choose between actions which are better or worse
4170447 defending his state particularly during a time of war makes it imperative that a leader keep his people unified and supportive of his policies
4170448 wise men who want to remove this difficulty therefore have recourse to god
4170449 as the observance of divine institutions is the cause of the greatness of republics so the contempt of it is the cause of their ruin for where the fear of god is lacking it will happen that the kingdom will be ruined
4170450 princes of republics leaders of nations ought therefore to maintain their republics religions well and united
4170451 they ought in all things which arise to foster it and even if they should judge them false to favor and encourage it and the more they understand natural things so much more they ought to do this because this practice has been observed by wise men there has arisen the belief in miracles that are celebrated in religion however false for the prudent leaders have increased their importance from whatever origin they may have derived and their authority gives them credence with the people
4170452 ive already explained why i believe it to be the path of least evil for the cheney bush government to take firm control of the middle easts oil and what it must do to realize that objective
4170453 as i argued was necessary for seizing control of iraqs oil its economy has been destroyed the sunni elite and middle class have been killed or driven into exile
4170454 in my opening remarks i also explained that all people resist seeing themselves as evil regardless of how deeply evil they become that to avoid seeing themselves as evil they will avidly seek to be deceived and for this reason particularly in a time of war a leader must be adept at deception
4170455 by the end of this debate you will have formed an opinion about which of us dr marx or myself most objectively describes the world
4170456 to help you decide im going to close this first rebuttal with a citation from an article by paul craig roberts
4170457 once a conservative dr roberts is now a leading voice of the american left youll recall that marx quoted him in his opening statement
4170458 each of you will be able to judge for yourself how well my theory of politics accords with the events dr roberts describes events he disparages but which i understand and respect
4170459 roberts begins by discussing sami al arian a palestinian professor of computer engineering at the university of south florida who the department of justice charged with conspiracy to assist the cause of islamic jihad
4170460 the charges against al arian were rejected by a jury but the bush regime could not accept the obvious defeat
4170461 i contend roberts is correct albeit naive through a selective use of duplicity and persecution the cheney bush government is successfully molifying unifying americans behind its global strategy a strategy i believe is at once both an imperative and the same men who establish their social relations in conformity with their material productivity produce also principles ideas and categories in conformity with their social relations thus these ideas these categories are as little eternal as the relations they express they are historical and transitory products
4170462 ideas can never lead beyond an old world order but only beyond the ideas of the old world order ideas cannot carry out anything at all in order to carry out ideas men are needed who can exert practical force
4170463 marx often rambles but whenever the smallest part of his theory is questioned his mind immediately acquires the clarity of a dagger
4170464 good evening like my opponent i want to thank everyone involved in bringing this debate about as well as all of you in the audience for your open minded interest and civility
4170465 mr machiavelli presented a truncated materialist logic one diluted with non material assumptions and assertions but given the plethora of which describe human history as a product of lofty aspirations intelligent choices errors and misunderstandings rather than people acting upon their hard and fast socio economic interests i found it refreshing
4170466 we homo sapiens have been around between 200 000 250 000 years and for all but the last 10 000 we lived in hunting and gathering tribes with 20 to 100 members depending upon the available food
4170467 it was only a short 10 millenia ago that we finally began to progress from hunting and gathering to horticulture planting various crops together then to agriculture sowing and harvesting larger tracts of specific grains
4170468 over the course of that critical 10 000 years the populations of our communities grew continually larger hunting and gathering tribes had 20 100 members their semi nomadic horticultural agricultural replacements had hundreds and the latter in turn were succeeded by stationary feudal societies whose populations sometimes numbered in the millions todays capitalist communities are bigger still the u s presently having three hundred million people
4170469 for what portion of humanitys 200 000 year historical journey does mr machiavelli offer the last few hundred years characterized by the existence of principalities and nation states
4170470 it would be hard to formulate a theory of our species social economic and political evolution more truncated than that
4170471 mr machiavellis materialist logic is also badly diluted with idealist propositions
4170472 however immediately thereafter he informed us he would have supported the united states during world war ii saying the u
4170473 anyone whos studied world war ii knows that until 1943 hitler was more wildly popular with germans than either roosevelt or churchill was with their respective populations
4170474 as for japan historians have also documented its peoples enthusiasm from a western perspective a manic enthusiasm for prime minister tojo and emperor hirohito
4170475 when confronted with these material realities american sociologists often conclude the germans and japanese were duped or deluded into giving their leaders such unquestioning support but those are machiavelli would have limited his inquiry to disclosing the of wwii and the natural necessity of the roles played by each of the combatant nations refusing to take sides in a conflict that entailed the slaughter of over 70 million people
4170476 now to anyone whos the least bit objective its obvious that the positive and negative cultural contributions of our species have never been preponderantly eastern or western or the exclusive offerings of particular states
4170477 the german culture which graced the world with kant hegel schopenhauer nietzsche the aachen cathedral and the altes museum is the same german culture that cursed it with adolph hitler and hermann goering the holocaust the extermination of homosexuals and gypsies and the slave labor of millions of east europeans in national socialist factories
4170478 the french culture that contributed descarte voltaire renoir jean jacques rousseau the eiffel tower sacre couer and notre dame is the same french culture which massacred 50 000 huguenots in a six weeks orgy of blood in 1572 its the french culture that killed arabs indiscriminately during algerias 8 year battle for independence torturing children in front of parents and parents in front of their children
4170479 the italian culture of michelangelo and leonardo da vinci is the italian culture which produced pope gregory xiii who congratulated catherine de medici for exterminating the 50 000 calvinist huguenots ordered celebratory bonfires lighted and a gold medalion minted with the inscription slaughter of the huguenots its the italian culture that gave us both the brilliant galileo and the inquisition authorities who forced him to recant his heliocentric vision then put him under house arrest for the remainder of his life
4170480 spains cultural offerings include goya velasquez dali picasso miguel de cervantes the iglesia de montserrat and botanical gardens along with the inquisitions torture racks and the cruelly oppressive 40 year regime of general francisco franco
4170481 russian culture donated tchaikovsky rachmaninov dostoevsky anton chekov st basils cathedral and the cathedral of st michael the archangel it also furnished ivan the terrible and joseph stalin who rationalized and directed the killing of millions
4170482 in addition to confucius lao tsu the compass paper printing gun powder the potala palace the great wall and the forbidden city chinas cultural contributions to humanity include general chiang kai shek who in observed that while reconquering the mainland would mean death for many millions it would be well worth the effort today chinese culture includes the use of brute force to suppress the rights of tibetans as well as millions of its own people
4170483 then there was ancient greece called the fountainhead of western culture because it emphasized the use of reason and introduced our species to democracy ancient greece also waged centuries of bloody war over the control of land and its democracy which lived less than a hundred years was never available to women or slaves and almost every free family had slaves or even to freedmen
4170484 as for hapless iraq in addition to saddam and chemical ali its cultural offerings go all the way back that momentous 10 000 years to the dawn of modern civilization
4170485 on this occasion rumsfeld was at least being sincere as mr machiavelli documented making an omlet of iraq was what the u s was about
4170486 where determining the role the neocons and the u s are playing in the mid east is concerned machiavelli did start with a observation
4170487 common sense as well as all the available evidence indicates our ancestors also paid fealty and fought to defend their various pre national communities besides being equally objective the much simpler proposition that
4170488 it accurately describes the practices of ancestral tribes and other pre national communities as well as those of the feudal and capitalist states with which my opponent seems so exclusively concerned
4170489 the foremost objective of a leader who wishes to maintain his favored status must be the preservation of the community upon which a reproduction of his peoples social existences depends
4170490 common sense and the historical record make it clear any leader who fails to accomplish that feat will be in serious trouble
4170491 having reworded mr machiavellis central axioms to make them not just the behavior of people joined in national communities ill
4170492 those of you unfamiliar with my theory may be surprised to hear i begin by agreeing with my conservative predecessor adam smith that we humans are driven by self interest
4170493 its here that adam smiths thinking and my own diverge sharply
4170494 smith described the populations of capitalist communities as engaged in trying to their socio economic conditions
4170495 dont misunderstand me i am not denying given members of a community will strive to improve their socio economic situations my point is more fundamental
4170496 it therefore follows that insofar as some individuals acquire more of the productive pie other members of the community must receive less and that will be creative of tension conflict enmity rather than amity between them
4170497 which is why politicians always attempt to make pies bigger rather than give more to one social segment by taking from another its also why conservative legislators correctly accuse liberal colleagues who dare to suggest policies expropriative of the wealthy of engaging in the acquisitive efforts of particular individuals will be destructive not creative of community its members are somehow bound together in the here and now its obvious they are not being bound by the attempts of some to gain
4170498 smith theorized theyre held together by an unseen hand i contend that for a materialist the nature of the hand is clear it is nothing other than the shared desire of every community member to reproduce his her social existence and as i will demonstrate it is the members of a community acting upon this shared material objective an objective assumed and unspoken which has driven our species forth
4170499 when hunting and gathering tribes became too large to obtain adequate food in a given territory they initially did what bees and ants do intent on reproducing their primitive social existence some members of the tribe simply swarmed to a new location
4170500 population growth and the desire to maintain social existence gradually led our earliest ancestors to inhabit remote regions of the earth adapting to different climates and different food sources as they moved
4170501 eventually however with tribal populations continuing to increase and the amount of new habitable territory declining fighting began over the control of specific lands judging from the practices of tribes who presently inhabit tropical regions of asia africa and latin america our warring tribal ancestors used a variety of symbols tattoos feathers paints and animistic deities to identify themselves and their causes and to strengthen their resolve
4170502 at various times in various locations reproducing social existence required tribes to turn their enemies into a source of protein their cannibalism was similarly justified made rational with elaborate beliefs ceremonies and incantations
4170503 after hunting and gathering for 190 000 plus years our ancestors approached a critical juncture there were too many people for the earth to feed house and clothe if they continued using that order of production and distribution
4170504 to succinctly describe the oxymoronic situation our hunting and gathering predecessors now faced their quest for a constancy of social existence would force them to radically change
4170505 as war ceased to be the easiest way for hunters and gatherers to reproduce their social existence they began making slaves of enemies rather than killing them establishing nomadic slave communities domesticating animals and practicing rudimentary agriculture
4170506 whereupon a territory which had provided for 20 100 hunters and gatherers could now sustain several times that number and do it at a significantly higher socio economic level providing better food clothing and shelter the problem of overpopulation and consequent violent struggle was momentarily relieved and our species social evolution at long last began
4170507 und dort haben sie es the dialectical materialist nature of humanitys historical progress fundamental socio economic political changes have been the result of an assumed desire for no change under material circumstances which were themselves undergoing transformation principally though not exclusively because of an increase in population
4170508 from hunting and gathering to nomadic slave to feudal and i believe to capitalist each succeeding order of production and distribution has been able to sustain a given number of people at a given socio economic level
4170509 fortunately at the same time each has spawned then nurtured into adolesence a more cornucopian and flexible system which able to socio economically maintain the community and to heal the wounds its parent order had inflicted
4170510 after the city of rome had been built and the surrounding countryside cultivated by its citizens the conditions of the community were different from what they had been before
4170511 throughout much of temperate western europe our ancestors defensive formation of feudal productive orders was brought about by the equally defensive predations of scandinavian vikings in the 8
4170512 they initially raided europes coastal regions in search of silver gold and slaves but central europes fertile land and warmer weather soon led them to establish villages and settle down further destabilizing the lives of those whose territories they invaded
4170513 british historian william stubbs noted that for indigenous central europeans the
4170514 within europes nascent feudal communities everyones life practices became rigidly but protectively defined control of the land was of prime importance serfs worked it with the kings sanction lords owned it but were above doing any physical work the lords were warriors whose principal function was to defend everyone including the monarch and the serfs against invasion
4170515 in addition the lords were sworn to furnish adequate land firewood and housing materials for their serfs on their parts the serfs tasks included animal husbandry crop raising building and maintaining the monarchs and lords dwellings carrying their water making their clothing currying their horses and as the feudal productive order matured following the lords into battle
4170516 all relationships between lords peasants religious authorities and kings were justified and sustained not by monetary exchanges or legal agreements but by enforced by each individuals sense of obligation barter this for that trade rather than currency controlled nearly every other movement of goods
4170517 money lending for interest was considered usury and sinful on the part of borrowers as well as lenders behind it all stood the roman catholic church unified with the state formulating and propagating the appropriate philosophical rationales and pressuring recalcitrants to abide by their obligations lest they suffer punishment at the hand of god
4170518 but like hunting and gathering and nomadic slave communities before them in time they started having difficulty maintaining the social existence of their increasing populations for a few hundred years again like their predecessors feudal principalities states eased the problem by warring with one another
4170519 gradually however taking another progressive step and establishing the more cornucopian capitalist order of production became a
4170520 while its possible that by reducing western europes population by one quarter to one half the bubonic plague
4170521 historian fernand braudel argues the plague aggravated an economic recession which had started 50 years before
4170522 recession was also making europes battles hence its armies grandscale that entailed using hired soldiers cast iron cannon and swords in ever larger quantities all of which likewise had to be paid for with money finally the recession prompted many lords to expand their landholdings in an effort to hang on that too required the use of legal tender
4170523 in order to obtain the necessary funds lords had no alternative to borrowing from the inchoate financiers located in cities which meant usury would have to begin losing its feudal church dictated stigma land holding nobles further undermined their feudal productive orders by sending sons who were unable to acquire personal estates to the rapidly growing cities where they became financiers and merchants as well as engaging in handicraft and rudimentary industrial production makers and sellers of the swords cannon and uniforms the feudal elites so desperately needed
4170524 confronting europeans with the material reality that religious devotion could no longer offer them protection economic recession and plague had also begun eroding the catholic churchs unquestioned authority
4170525 purporting to be jesus earthly intermediary the feudal church had traditionally absolved individuals of their sins for confession and or good deeds such as aiding the poor
4170526 but by the late 13th century feudalisms growing inability to sustain europes population was squeezing the clergy whose numbers were also increasing along with everyone else prompting the church to begin
4170527 machiavelli described how a lack of rain and fertile land led the spanish to conquer new world territories in order to as
4170528 but there was another equally important process at work in spain financiers work shop manufacturers and merchants with jews in the forefront were effecting changes which threatened the countrys feudal structure
4170529 with rare exception jews had not been allowed to become members of europes land owning elite as a consequence they maintained social existence by adopting the indicated industrial world occupations making them urban dwelling leaders of the revolutionary capitalist transformation
4170530 conservatively predictably the landholding elite initially responded to the mounting threat with a cautious antisemitism demanding jews either leave the country or convert to the elites feudal understanding of christianity
4170531 while hundreds of thousands of jews took the second course their everyday practices continued to have the same capitalist order impact as before
4170532 in 1478 acquiescing to pressure being exerted by the landed nobility through king ferdinand and queen isabella pope sixtus iv authored the brutal spanish inquisition
4170533 fourteen years later the king and queen ordered that jews be expelled from the country
4170534 but although the feudal elite could not foresee it spain would soon relieve its developing productive order crisis by exporting excess population to while acquiring huge quantities of gold silver and other mineral riches from the new world
4170535 portugals situation was similar to that of spain insufficient arable land infertile soil and inadequate rainfall and like spain it relieved its feudal order crisis by exporting people and importing new world pelf
4170536 spain and portugals new world successes were rapid ruthless and astoundingly profitable during one period of only a few weeks columbus
4170537 francisco pizzaro had a similar experience when he entered peru after slaughtering 7 000 of atahuallpas warriors in a single night pizzaro agreed to give the inca king freedom in exchange for silver and gold atahuallpa provided him with two and a half tons of gold and five tons of silver as his part of the bargain pizzaro then had him strangled to better secure control of the country
4170538 portugal too reaped and raped remarkable profit during this period
4170539 neither the resistance of native populations nor their disappearance through european diseases to which they had no natural defense proved to be obstacles of great significance flagrant brutality and extermination solved the first the importation of millions of african slaves the second
4170540 with large numbers of their people moving to the new world and establishing the grand fiefdoms no longer available at home their economies infused by stolen new world treasure for the next three hundred years spain and portugals feudal systems again became secure
4170541 but where colonialism and the theft of latin american wealth also african wealth in portugals case would enable the spanish and portuguese land holding elites to preserve their pre capitalist orders such efforts did not work nearly so well for france and england
4170542 because their feudal systems of production began experiencing structural crisis a little later than those of spain and portugal england and france trailed those two countries where attempting to vent excess population in the new world and seize its riches were concerned
4170543 not that the late comers failed to try without exception all of england and frances new world incursions during the 17
4170544 yet however much they prayed god seemed unsympathetic there were no vast stores of mineral wealth waiting to be seized in the unconquered regions of north america in addition the northern territories had a far less hospitable climate and were inhabited by indians who not living in large easily destroyed cities were able to fight back when their own social existences were threatened
4170545 the first shipload of englands jamestown settlers arrived in may 1607
4170546 additional hundreds of colonists reached jamestown over the next couple decades yet where energizing englands feudal economy was concerned the jamestown settlement continued to have little value and the colonists were soon at war with natives
4170547 in 1622 347 of what were by then approximately 1 400 settlers were murdered by algonquians enraged at being driven from traditional lands by the colonizers tobacco farming writer karen lange notes that
4170548 under the circumstances very few english were interested in moving to the new world and frances new world ventures proved even less rewarding
4170549 both countries then tried to ease their feudal order crises with piracy if they could not compete with spain and portugal in stealing new world wealth they could at least profit by robbing the robbers
4170550 the number of french and english who were finding it necessary to take up capitalist world occupations to survive had long been growing the construction of ships needed to export colonists and raid spanish and portuguese vessels the manufacturing of axes plows hammers nails guns clothing etc for provisioning their own as well as ironically spanish and portuguese settlers only accelerated that transformation
4170551 having no less painful and disruptive alternative left for maintaining the majority of its peoples social existence in the mid 17 th century england underwent the capitalist revolution followed by france a hundred years later
4170552 with their capitalist revolutions political power was wrenched from the increasingly decrepit hands of landowners and given to the financiers merchants and industrialists whose hour of authority had arrived
4170553 the privileges the institutions of guilds and corporations the regulatory regime of the middle ages were social relations that alone corresponded to the acquired productive forces and to the social condition which had previously existed and from which these institutions had arisen
4170554 i reiterated my central thesis in the annenkov letter observing
4170555 by producing a drastic improvement in peoples security clothing housing food quality and therefore their health and longevity each generated a more explosive increase in population than its forerunner leading in turn to its own more rapid exhaustion and demise
4170556 hunters and gatherers lived about 17 years rarely more than 20 the average life span of many capitalist country populations is over 75
4170557 demographers estimate that when columbus set sail the total world population was about 400 million at present only a few hundred years after capitalist systems of production began to be erected its over 6 6 billion and rapidly growing
4170558 its also obvious why the changes in productive distributive orders have all been unidirectional
4170559 if the united states decided to return to a feudal existence at least 60 percent of americans would either have to be exiled or killed an estimated 2 percent of the population currently produces over 90 percent of the countrys foodstuffs using sophisticated irrigation systems tractors plows and combines that only a highly advanced industrial economy can provide the foodstuffs are then distributed via trains planes and semis which likewise require a complex industrial order for their manufacture so too with everything else americans enjoy including housing clothing medical care entertainment and travel
4170560 similarly maintaining the social existences of the french or english during the 16 th century would have been impossible if they had decided to raze their feudal productive orders and revert to using nomadic slave or hunting and gathering systems of production
4170561 the transition from hunting and gathering to the nomadic slave mode of production introduced an important new ingredient specific tasks began to be performed by specific individuals as the slave order achieved viability it started turning out goods and services in excess of the amount required to reproduce everyones social existence
4170562 due to the division of labor some individuals the slave masters found themselves in control of that excess
4170563 having a hegemonic status to be preserved the elites then needed special protective devices
4170564 individuals calling themselves marxists sometimes portray elites as duplicitous where the creation and employment of philosophy religion and political institutions are concerned
4170565 to the contrary ive argued elites instinctively and sincerely religio philosophical ideas create those practices which most effectively least disruptively enable them to secure their favored social existences
4170566 for the same reason middle classes and the poor just as
4170567 if non elite members of a community were to reject the elites philosophical vision they would have to confront the elite physically and neither of them would be socio economically sustained
4170568 therefore as long as productive orders have been able to perpetuate reproduce their social existences non elites have reflexively internalized and acted upon the elites perspectives sometimes enthusiastically sometimes under protest depending upon how well they were being sustained
4170569 on this matter our disagreement could not be more complete
4170570 the american elites who defended their favored interests with the argument that settlers of western territories were fighting believed it to be true so too did the settlers respecting that issue no deception whatsoever was involved
4170571 stalin and the soviet bureaucrats who protected their more prosperous social existences and that of the countrys state capitalist elite with the claim they were imprisoning or killing tens of millions of pro capitalist traitors during the great depression were thoroughly convinced that was what they were doing
4170572 so too with the nazis proposition germany was involved in a fateful struggle against a jewish communist conspiracy to dominate the world hitler goering himmler speer and other national socialist leaders were more than willing to lie in the service of what they considered true
4170573 finally american leaders were not lying when they described a threat to u s investments in latin america asia and africa from the 1960s to the late 80s the of communist communism which those with menaced investments employed was anyone or anything which threatens our interests hence for them raping torturing and killing into submission or out of existence individuals who posed the threats was seen as a painful but imperative endeavor a removal of cancer in order to save the patient they often intoned
4170574 if any of you still believe this countrys leaders were insincere about their anti communist crusade i suggest
4170575 during the same period the soviet unions elite employed their own unique interest protective definitions threats to their favored socio economic status which came from the right were repressed as capitalist threats from the left were labelled leftist adventurism and crushed with equal vigor
4170576 in each of these cases elites and their political representatives
4170577 have you never noticed that no one whether politically left right or liberal ideas which when they act upon them as valid result in
4170578 granted however history is made by people acting in community and there are clearly no community exceptions
4170579 similarly the people of self described socialist communist nations have rationalized not imitating che by calling him an elevated status they concede they have not yet personally attained
4170580 in both instances the exceptions are idolized and as all of human history attests when people idolize they never emulate
4170581 if tomorrow everyone began behaving as christ prescribed common sense argues it would mean the end of christianity
4170582 the men who joined che in the bolivian mountains probably him but its illogical to suppose they
4170583 its the reality of our universally shared experience that insofar as groups communities of people have the same socio economic existences to defend the question whether they should permit one another complete freedom of speech press and assembly never arises
4170584 here in the united states conservatives like william bennett ramesh ponnuru and richard mellon scaife dont debate granting each other such license
4170585 neither do their liberal counterparts it would never occur to hillary clinton al gore and ted kennedy to argue the propriety of allowing one another unfettered rights to organize publish and speak
4170586 nor again do individuals on the left michael parenti noam chomsky michael moore and howard zinn for instance
4170587 its the reality of our shared experience that whenever members of one community have found they could no longer preserve their socio economic existences if those in another community were permitted to do so they have readily taken each others lives and with a lot less hesitation theyve denied one another freedom of press speech and assembly
4170588 at such moments stifling any democratic impulses they might have people have begun to oppress and to kill
4170589 u s supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes defended the principle involved when he argued no one should be allowed to
4170590 if you examine the courts application of the holmes proposition you will find that political ideas labelled were invariably ones which if acted upon by the public to whom they were addressed would have been expropriative of the socio economic existences of the people who called them that and the theater was said to be crowded insofar as it appeared likely the broader public might act
4170591 besides protecting the elites hegemonic interests the state of productive system serves everyone by defending from threats both foreign and domestic the order which enables a reproduction of their socio economic conditions
4170592 for the same reason when an exhausted order of production has been razed as its successor begins to acquire viability its self understanding i e its philosophy
4170593 the formal features which attest a philosophy has achieved that importance that it is the living soul of the culture were the same in all times
4170594 it follows that whether a communitys philosophy religion is perpetuated undergoes modification or is discarded entirely in favor of another will be determined by the kind and degree of material change occurring in the situations of those who embrace it
4170595 morality religion metaphysics all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness thus no longer retain the semblance of
4170596 if we judge our species by what we do our answer to that rhetorical question must be yes
4170597 if youve followed my materialist logic of sam harris richard dawkins christopher hitchens daniel dennett and other contemporary hegelians who put ideas in the lead and blame the worlds suffering on religion
4170598 like me most of you will undoubtledly agree with harris that the feudalists were
4170599 however we also know because both common sense and our experience demand it that if today the people of japan france or any other industrial nation decided to restore the feudal order theyd immediately find it necessary to adopt its system sustaining web of beliefs
4170600 if when confronted with this predicament harris dawkins hitchens et al still insist on maintaining their stance it goes from being implausible to being absurd
4170601 were not suggesting the transition from hunting and gathering tribes to nomadic slave communities to feudal and capitalist nations was pre determined by an inflexible universe or a manipulative god
4170602 while our species has reaped ever more wondrous benefits from the last ten millenia of its 200 000 year trip for equally clear hundreds of millions of us have also suffered terrible pain
4170603 at the apex of such tragic moments describing challenges to their interests as a
4170604 being an inveterate optimist ill remind you that while frenzied assaults by defenders of expended orders have proven fatal for countless representatives of nascent systems they have also affirmed every new systems propriety
4170605 as frances feudal system became drained of viability the landed aristocracy for whom preserving feudalism was vital if their socio economic conditions were going to be maintained went on the offensive against upstart pro capitalist order protestants whose rejection of the catholic churchs authority the feudalists considered downright
4170606 a decade later frenchmen who openly challenged the feudal church whether in speech or in writing were being put to death
4170607 the bloodiest struggles attending the exhaustion of european feudalism took place in germany limited and insecure access to the atlantic ocean and none to the mediterranean sea had restricted trade between prussia and other countries regions including africa and the new world as a result the creation of a subcommunity of capitalist financiers craft producers and merchants had not proceeded as far as it had in france
4170608 as a consequence from 1618 48 prussians battled over who would exercise feudal control of the land when the ended more than 9 million germans 20 30 percent of the population had been killed but the strain on the regions feudal socio economic political organization had been momentarily relieved
4170609 not until the unification of germany under otto von bismark in 1871 were capitalist financiers and industrialists finally brought into the ascendant
4170610 the civil war was not fought exclusively as it seemed to many over the moral issue of slavery or such narrow economic issues as tariffs
4170611 the russian revolution of 1917 and the three year civil war which followed ended
4170612 china underwent the same revolution in the 1930s and 40s suffering an even greater loss of life there too the building of an increasingly vibrant though environmentally devastating state capitalist productive distributive order has been the result
4170613 mr machiavelli observed china has 10 billionaires according to the latest that number has now grown to 106 ninety percent of them children of the countrys top 2 900 political authorities
4170614 what does our species 200 000 year socio economic political evolution have to do with the neocons strategy for seizing control of iraqs oil and making the united states imperial leader of the world
4170615 has capitalism like hunting and gathering nomadic slave and feudal productive distributive systems before it been drained of viability has it as i will argue reached its
4170616 is capitalism simultaneously forging its own successor i e is a new problem solving order coming into being within capitalist countries a new way of relating people to one another and to the production and distribution of goods
4170617 if so are representatives of that nascent order beginning to threaten the elites who benefit most from the moribund capitalist system of production and distribution
4170618 are those whose interests are challenged moving toward an oppressive
4170619 to compete not merely with each other but with south korean chinese and indian neo capitalist producers entering the global market u s japanese french german british et al manufacturers must sell ever greater quantities of shirts shoes suits plates pots and pans hand tools refrigerators and blenders tvs cars and motorcycles etc
4170620 selling that greater quantity of goods forces capitalists to engage in a never ending expansion and sophistication of production which in turn requires a writing
4170621 the problem for many third world states today is that when capitalist countries buy their mineral agricultural products and pour in ever larger quantities of shoes shirts pots and pans they cut the throats of millions of poor saudis iraqis pakistanis afghanis indonesians algerians moroccans egyptians and filipinos who survive by hand making shoes and sandals shirts turbans and other items of native attire or by hammering out pots and pans or by forming and firing pottery and plates
4170622 and its not only the poor whose lives are being ravaged
4170623 capitalisms aggressive economic penetration of nonindustrialized countries with tvs cds dvds and movies is also devastating middle class artists and actors replacing their nations traditional tastes with those of japan and the industrial west while providing them like the poor with nothing in the way of alternative occupations
4170624 even highly educated children of mid eastern elites doctors dentists architects chemists and engineers are finding the virulent capitalist invasion leaves no place for them
4170625 the poor cant afford doctors and dentists there arent enough people in the middle class to pay for their professional services and the elites fly to new york london or paris for their own medical dental procedures
4170626 when mid eastern oil sheikhs have palaces and shopping malls constructed in saudi arabia or kuwait when they build airports seaports luxury hotels theaters fantasy playlands and skyscrapers in dubai or a massive water pipeline in the united arab emirates they contract with global corporations like haliburton bechtel fluor parsons kajima and taisei
4170627 those companies have their own architects and engineers they dont hire local professionals they also bring in low paid semi slave workers from the philippines india pakistan and sri lanka who toil 12 hours a day 6 days a week doing the menial labor
4170628 with no less painful option left for maintaining their social existences or that of their nations middle class and poor some educated sons and daughters of mid eastern and asian feudal elites begin formulating plans for expropriating western interests along with their countries western oriented elites and establishing new structures which can sustain them all structures which as in post khomeini iran are in some ways terribly reactionary in others progressive
4170629 moreover its not just capitalist manufacturers and financiers whose activities are devastating third world peoples the agribusinesses of advanced capitalist nations are equally aggressive in eliminating their jobs they are also destroying their environments and impairing their health
4170630 according to investigative reporter john ross new years 2008 may prove to be their doomsday
4170631 ten thousand square miles of amazon rainforest were cleared in 2006 alone the burning of tree stumps and branches spewing 370 million tons of hydrocarbons into the air
4170632 cargill brazils largest exporter of soybeans and sugar provides few jobs nearly all of them extremely low paid many brazilian farmers under contract with cargill have been found to use slave labor
4170633 monsanto cargill and other u s agribusinesses are also destroying the infrastructure of rural india by bribing indian officials theyve succeeded in promoting cotton and rice seeds genetically engineered to produce sterile plants forcing the countrys small farmers to buy new seeds yearly at prices few of them can afford
4170634 nor can indian farmers rely on traditional seeds since their plants cross pollinate with those of monsanto and cargill producing seeds which are also sterile
4170635 adding insult to injury when an agribusiness corporation is able to demonstrate that a farmers seeds contain a gene of its engineered plants it takes him to court and forces him to pay for using his own seeds
4170636 if despite the formidible hurdles u s agribusinesses place in his path an indian farmer has a good crop it must then compete with cotton the same corporations produce in the u s using a 4 billion government subsidy they receive each year to keep the international price of cotton low
4170637 indias farmers once produced all of the countrys edible oils from mustard seed sesame seed linseed and coconut then in 1998 physicist vandana shiva relates monsanto and cargill obtained a ban on indigenous oils today 70 percent of indias edible oils are soya and palm dumped on the country by u s global corporations
4170638 during the past decade the activities of cargill monsanto unilever adm and other agribusiness corporations have led more than 165 000 of indias small farmers to commit suicide many of them the cruelest of ironies by drinking monsantos glyphosphate pesticide
4170639 where cargills soybean production is destroying the amazon rainforest the purchase of massive and growing quantities of palm oil by u s japanese and european capitalist corporations is doing the same thing to the rainforests of borneo
4170640 since 1990 indonesia has razed 61 million acres of its south borneo rainforests planting palm oil trees in their stead and it plans to level and palm tree plant another 61 million acres by 2030
4170641 replaced with palm oil tree plantations malaysias immense north borneo rainforests have almost disappeared along with the orangutan and exotic birds which lived in them
4170642 finally the u s and other capitalist states whose productive orders are approaching the are not only eliminating employment in the third world they are doing it at home as well
4170643 if you have a problem with your computer probably made in china and phone the manufacturer youll speak with a technician living in india
4170644 call your hospital to challenge an expense and you may discuss it with someone in ireland employed by the firm that does the hospitals billing
4170645 doctors and dentists have begun to feel the effect of this and you will receive over 500 hits promoting plastic surgery kidney transplant heart bypass knee hip and shoulder joint replacement at hospitals located in mexico india malaysia the philippines even iran
4170646 youre assured the physicians have received the latest training very likely in the west and that they use the most up to date diagnostic and medical equipment sold to them by japanese or western capitalist corporations
4170647 besides a round trip flight surgery and hospitalization the tour agency will arrange for your recovery in a luxury hotel fed according to your personal tastes and visited regularly by a physician all for a fraction of what you would pay for these services at home
4170648 economist paul craig roberts has countered that proposition citing numerous correspondents who are unable to find
4170649 today roberts adds the jobs of indian guest workers may themselves be on the verge of being offshored
4170650 princeton university economist alan blinder estimates 30 to 40 million american high end service jobs ultimately face offshoring
4170651 regarding the lower end service jobs of middle class americans its fairly obvious whos helping capitalism do them in
4170652 from food chains to walmart to home depot large retail stores have installed significantly reducing the number of employees required for given dollar amounts of sales
4170653 what kinds of low tech jobs is capitalism providing to replace those which disappear drug pusher prostitute police officer prison guard security guard and border guard are among the more important
4170654 over 260 privately operated prisons have sprung into existence offering investment opportunities and modestly paid to americans who are able to justify defining fellow citizens as for using or selling often small amounts of marijuana or cocaine
4170655 fifty five percent of federal prison inmates are incarcerated for drug offenses only 11 percent for violent crimes
4170656 the mi corporations and their employees are major consumers in their communities purchasing real estate
4170657 t he military is deeply involved with disaster relief which brings many more good people into its orbit red cross volunteers state and local government officials and staff vista workers etc northrop is very generous to career services officers in higher education
4170658 military contractors are attentive to every kind of minority organization asians against domestic abuse and the vietnamese american community halliburton the american indian science and engineering society and the national society of black engineers northrop grumman the holocaust museum and the chinese community center ge
4170659 machiavelli tacitly acknowledged the connection between the united states military industrial complex and its foreign policy when he remarked that defending the countrys third world interests from expropriation after wwii led it to drastically increase the production and sale of weapons
4170660 however he offered no explanation for the growing challenge to u s investments in the underdeveloped world
4170661 from the 1960s to the 90s u s corporations with threatened latin american interests had their own novel theory
4170662 as in the middle east today many of the elites sons and daughters were unable to find employment which could socio economically sustain them while particularly in peru northeastern brazil bolivia nicaragua uruguay and el salvador poor indian communities were experiencing a suffering they hadnt known since the 1930s
4170663 as in the middle east today the socio economic injury which children of south americas elites were experiencing prompted the more humane among them to discover empathize with the far greater distress of the poor
4170664 embracing that part of my theory which describes exhausted feudal orders of production being replaced by capitalist systems like the russian and chinese revolutionaries before them they proposed seizing large foreign businesses and using the profit which operating them yielded to industrialize their countries erecting state capitalist systems that would provide employment for their middle class and poor as well as for themselves
4170665 im sure you know the rest of the story so i wont waste time on elaborate detail
4170666 the latin american rebels were menacing major u s corporations and that was sufficient for the u s to identify them as nixon ordered when chiles president salvador allende seized i t t and the u s copper multinationals offering to pay what the expropriated corporations claimed their properties were worth when paying taxes
4170667 with indispensable u s assistance allende was overthrown on september 11 th 1973 and general augusto pinochet a fascist dictator who sincerely believed he was purifying his country of evil seized power
4170668 right wing generals and admirals took control in brazil uruguay argentina bolivia ecuador and paraguay joining with pinochet to identify and assassinate the hot headed youths leading the struggle for change simultaneously suppressing worker peasants movements
4170669 at least 30 000 humanistic young men and women lost their lives in many were brutally tortured and buried or tossed into the sea some alive some dead from helicopters and planes
4170670 during the 1980s central america was similarly bought bullied and butchered back in line an estimated 200 000 poor indians were slaughtered in the process entire villages wiped out
4170671 machiavelli observed the attendant u s stock market losses exceeded 7 trillion
4170672 what he neglected to add is that 82 percent of those stocks are held by the wealthiest 10 percent of americans which meant over 5 7 trillion of the loss was suffered by the rich
4170673 the u s economy was in the doldrums with many large companies hurting badly
4170674 bechtel corporations earnings peaked at 15 1 billion in 1999 then plummeted to 11 6 billion in 2002
4170675 under dick cheneys guidance halliburton merged with dresser industries in 1998 becoming
4170676 but dresser had lost numerous suits for asbestos related deaths resulting in a 43 percent drop in the value of halliburtons stock in 2001
4170677 with the collapse of the soviet union and ending of the cold war u s defense budgets had also fallen throughout the 1990s and employment in the defense industry fell with it more than 2 millions defense industry jobs were lost between 1992 and 2001
4170678 keeping in mind that communities always unify around those ideas which will most effortlessly sustain them with the united states economy depressed and much of its manufacturing base off shored with the largest most profitable remaining industries military industrial in nature what would you expect this country to do
4170679 representatives of the u s elite whose social existences were in jeopardy discovered created an enemy it would require spending from hundreds of billions to incalculable trillions of dollars on military hardware and military conquest to defeat meaning any muslim who stands up against the united states increasingly injurious practices in their countries
4170680 since saddam was a muslim since he sided with the palestinian struggle against israel and resisted u
4170681 in preparation a month before the attack cheney convened an whose members included executives and lobbyists from enron exxon mobil conoco phillips shell and bp america
4170682 for many major u s corporations the remarkable financial benefits coming from the
4170683 following their anti muslim terrorist logic the bush neocons have spread the largess derived from conquering and killing them
4170684 u s mercenaries are benefitting handsomely the state departments corporations dyncorp international triple canopy and blackwater usa have been awarded contracts valued at over 4 billion had been paid more than 400 million for helping sell the iraq war to americans and iraqis and for polishing the image of the u s installed governments of iraq and afghanistan
4170685 from the outset of the war with its economy starved for profit the u s has made a grab and gobble effort to extract it from iraq
4170686 then one month after shock and awe daniel amstutz a former cargil corporation executive was assigned
4170687 before leaving iraq in june 2004 l paul bremer head of the issued a body of orders mandating the kind of make money by driving third world peoples to the wall policies which are causing such deep hatred of the united states throughout most of the middle east
4170688 order 17 grants foreign contractors including private security firms full immunity from iraqs laws
4170689 order 39 privatization of iraqs state owned enterprises allows 100 percent foreign ownership of iraqi businesses unrestricted tax free remittance of all profits and other funds 40 year ownership licenses it permits u
4170690 order 40 turns the banking sector from a state run to a market driven system allowing foreign banks to
4170691 order 49 drops the tax rate on corporations from 40 percent to a flat rate of 15 percent
4170692 except for a diminishing number of first and third world elites 21 st century capitalism is making it difficult to impossible for peoples in both hemispheres to reproduce their social existence and the principal instrument the united states currently uses to hold its capitalist structure together is military industrial expenditure justified by the neocons insane anti terrorist vision
4170693 straddling the earth like a biomechanical beast it inflicts environmental destruction and lethal pollution around the globe and those injuries are done to everyone from wealthy saudi u s and chinese elites to the most destitute communities of afghanistan and sub saharan africa
4170694 the mediterranean sea italys environmental minister said that in thirty years care of the mediterranean sea it has not improved it has worsened
4170695 members of an indigenous tribe from the peruvian amazon are suing the oil giant occidental petroleum in californias superior court
4170696 there are over 3 000 industrial and mining enterprises which release more than one billion tons of wastewater annually containing more than 50 different pollutants
4170697 the indian ocean during a six week expedition during february and march 1999 a team of scientists from the u
4170698 poured into the air by coal burning power plants the coal dust returns to earth as acid rain and acid snow sulfuric acid nitric acid and carbonic acid from cars trucks and factory farm operations are acid rains other main components
4170699 as a result hundreds of thousands of acres of trees in the northeastern u s are either threatened or dying as are forests throughout scandinavia and western europe
4170700 vast tracts of the czech republics jizera mountains forests have perished and acid rain has destroyed so much of germanys famous black forest that its often referred to as dead
4170701 driven by rapid industrial development acid rain is an impending disaster in china india russia and the republic of korea between1990 and 2010 asias sulfur dioxide emissions are expected to triple
4170702 and its not just trees that are being injured by acid rain entering lakes stream and rivers the acid kills insects fish and shore birds virginas native trout streams are succumbing as are many of the lakes streams and rivers of wales their acid content increased by 30 percent in the last few decades affecting everything that lives in or is dependent upon them including humans
4170703 the extraction and cleaning of coal inevitably decimates ecosystems and communities
4170704 big coals representatives have been licking their lips at the prospect of tearing the tops off more u s mountains to sell vast quantities of coal to china whose own coal mining operations result in the deaths of 6 000 miners every year
4170705 what can be done about the global catastrophe ive described the environmental desolation the elimination of social existence sustaining earth protecting employment
4170706 while im open to argument my own answer to that question is nothing until and unless the capitalist order of production and distribution is dismantled and replaced
4170707 alarmed governments around the world have been passing laws aimed at cleaning up streams lakes and seas and regulating acid producing emissions but the problem reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by 50 percent in the northeast u s alone would cost 7 billion yearly if so doing it globally would cost trillions and that would do nothing about all the other environmental devastation
4170708 given its size content and distance from land removing the patch would be a mega billion dollar operation requiring the design and construction of special equipment and a second smaller garbage patch is floating between hawaii and japan
4170709 as for the worlds mounting unemployment european capitalist states have begun following the united states and israels lead labelling individuals whose actions disrupt their injurious practices at home then putting them in jail those who do it abroad and employing military violence to suppress them
4170710 an honest examination of capitalisms contamination of the planets air streams lakes rivers and seas with myriad pollutants from myriad sources the oil mercury arsenic lead cadmium nitrogen cyanide toluene styrene phosphate sulfur dioxide antibiotics and pcbs its mad use of nuclear energy and equally mad proposals to store nuclear waste along with its elimination of jobs in both the first and third worlds can only lead to one conclusion
4170711 the capitalist productive distributive order isnt up to the task of stopping the global cataclysm its creating let alone building a better world
4170712 capitalist states are no more capable of solving the disastrous problems theyre causing than nomadic slave communities could have built houses and chateaux for feudal europe or european feudal communities could have satisfied the need for factories and the clothing weaponry railways steam engines and trains those factories produced
4170713 which brings us to the third of our fundamental questions
4170714 if capitalism has turned into a monster devoid of self control has it like its predecessors also spawned a more effectual successor which many capitalists are having to nurture in order to reproduce their own social existence
4170715 once that question has been posed the answer screams for recognition
4170716 the integrated global community capitalists are defensively building can only be made to function with increasingly sophisticated high technological devices global positioning systems gps robotic machinery computers the internet broadband bluetooth etc
4170717 as the computer and the internet are already demonstrating though an indispensible tool for capitalism high technology is also a revolutionary threat because living and working in the high technology world aborning will require that people take full and free control of their lives and it will require that they share
4170718 the high techies who write capitalisms most complex software programs use an called linux
4170719 the high technology world of freedom participation and sharing johnson depicts doesnt just touch becoming immersed in it and the reproduction of everyones social existence increasingly depends upon its continued evolution
4170720 in 1999 shawn fanning helped lay the foundation of the post capitalist order when he founded fannings objective was to enable anyone with a computer and a little high tech savvy to download and distribute music programs just as quickly replaced it imesh morpheus limewire bearshare and kazaa
4170721 besides circumventing the film and music conglomerates which previously exercised unchallenged and highly profitable control over their industries groups are also undertaking a significant reduction in the corporate advertising to which subscribers are forcibly subjected
4170722 with hundreds of thousands of left right and liberal websites blogs available internet users can circumvent the national international news presented by major media getting news representing the experiences and interests of the people making the news directly rather than news interpreted by corporate executives or political representatives of the elite individuals who have their own sharp axes to grind
4170723 as a result the viewership of corporate controlled evening news programs has as one observer phrased it
4170724 cbs evening news had 19 million viewers in 1980 7 million in 2006 during the same period nbcs evening news viewership dropped from 17 2 million to 8 million abcs from 15 9 million to 8 25
4170725 to make up for a consequent loss in advertising revenue the media increased the number of ads viewers must endure driving more people from the tv to the computer aware those still watching tv tend to be older the media run more ads for drugs to ease remedy every conceivable illness real or imagined suffered by the aged turning additional younger healthier viewers away
4170726 robert scheer has noted rabbis ministers and priests are finding their lives being transformed by the high technology crusade
4170727 in 2006 musician bob ostertag posted all of his recordings on the web where they could be downloaded free ostertags explanation for doing it is worth citing at some length
4170728 when record companies first appeared making and selling records was a major undertaking making recorded music available to the general public required a significant outlay of capital which in turn required a legal structure that would provide a return on the required investment
4170729 to the argument that musicians who do this lose financially ostertag replies
4170730 as with music so too with writing using websites like can freely read or post fiction fantasy and horror stories
4170731 the list of things inviting americans to enter a post capitalist egalitarian world is long and growing
4170732 gps devices that make it possible for property owners to do
4170733 even the financing of national politicians is going high tech egalitarian in the fourth quarter of 2007 maverick republican ron paul set a record for internet contributions receiving 20 million in small donations
4170734 as i noted when discussing the self scanning check out counters in large retail stores it is capitalist industries which must promote such system destroying activities in order to remain competitive
4170735 they manufacture the machines oster uses to record his music and distribute it on the web they make the equipment used to illegally reproduce cds and dvds they encourage public participation in tv programming etc
4170736 there is another community of individuals in capitalist countries whose self sustaining activites have been chipping away at the integrity of the capitalist order the several million members of 100 plus environmental and peace organizations
4170737 like the terrorists they are struggling to make changes which their countries productive distributive systems cannot accommodate
4170738 theoretically of course the u s could stop creating terrorists by destroying the lives and health of third world peoples working with them to build a liveable world instead
4170739 theoretically it could create and install vast pollution removing and pollution controlling systems to restore its streams lakes and rivers to health
4170740 theoretically the u s could solve its energy and traffic congestion problems by financing construction and installation of solar panels on private homes by removing hydrogen from sea water to use as fuel and by building grids of high speed magnetically levitated trains
4170741 until its capitalist productive distributive order is dismantled and replaced i submit the future of the u s is clear
4170742 to keep its economy functioning will require ripping the tops off more mountains for coal drilling for oil in environmentally destructive places building additional life threatening nuclear power plants clear cutting additional millions of acres of national forests worsening the pollution of oceans lakes rivers and streams and poisoning more of its people
4170743 it will also necessitate spending additional trillions of dollars mostly borrowed from china and the middle east on weaponry which in turn will make the existence of a large and continually growing enemy imperative
4170744 which brings me to the last of our fundamental questions have some capitalists therefore begun self protectively moving in the direction of an oppressive
4170745 let me answer with a few quotations which describe where you americans are at rather precisely
4170746 anyone can now be imprisoned indefinitely without charges and denied any judicial review adds jim hightower
4170747 the government can monitor your phone calls read your email and open your snail mail observes matthew rothschild
4170748 were beginning to see who will be the inmates of the detention centers being built in the u s by halliburton under government contract the answer is civil libertarians critics of israel 9 11 skeptics critics of the administrations wars and foreign policies critics of the administrations use of kidnapping rendition torture and violation of the geneva conventions and critics of the administrations spying on americans
4170749 alas explain neocons david frum and richard perle there really is no middle way for americans it is victory or holocaust
4170750 statesmen will invent cheap lies putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked and every man will be glad of those conscience soothing falsities and will diligently study them and refuse to ex amine any refutations of them and thus he will by and by convince himself that the war is just and will thank god for the better sleep he enjoys after the process of grotesque self deception
4170751 in politics nothing happens by accident if it happens you can bet it was planned that way
4170752 i could write for days weeks and years about our machiavellian foreign policy and how it has created every ill that now afflicts us
4170753 there is only that which serves your purpose and that which doesnt
4170754 to destroy america from the inside with their relentless attacks on morality and truth
4170755 continues to act as a mirror and an echo chamber for the dark mood that has fallen over the west
4170756 emanates from our divine creator whose laws are not subject to amendment modification or recission by man
4170757 let me thank all of you for being here in particular i want to thank the american philosophical society for arranging the debate ive been waiting a long while for such an occasion and suffered a lot of undeserved animosity and vilification as i waited
4170758 i intend to accomplish two things this evening prove to you that your neocon leaders are faithful to my philosophy and more importantly convince you that under their direction the u s will win not only in iraq but throughout the middle east
4170759 if youre honest as i speak youll begin to realize im not merely describing individuals whom many of you regard as adversaries im also holding up a mirror and asking you to look at your own face
4170760 youll understand we have a lot more in common than youve heretofore acknowledged even to yourselves
4170761 my opponent has described himself as a materialist a realist whose only concern is with what he calls the natural necessity of historical conditions and events
4170762 i will demonstrate dr marx is nothing of the sort to the contrary hes an idealist whos dangerously preoccupied with the unachievable world of his longing marx once confessed his impractical idealism in an aphorism still popular with leftists
4170763 in the real world of our shared experience people come together to think and act as citizens of nation states
4170764 why do people behave this way again our experience provides the answer only by joining together in national communities which they give allegiance and fight to protect are they able to acquire physical emotional and psychological security find employment build homes feed and clothe their children and raise them to share the values they hold dear
4170765 in other words in the real world war with its attendent brutality and oppression is sometimes imperative if a leader would succeed in defending his state
4170766 having insufficient fertile land for its growing population to own as nobles and work as peasants 15th century spains king ferdinand and queen isabella preserved their state by ordering the violent conquest of new world regions hispaniola jamaica dominica the bahamas trinidad panama the virgin islands honduras cuba puerto rico mexico and peru
4170767 nineteenth century englands leaders used a combination of economic incentive and bloody conquest to obtain the raw materials and markets needed to hold their industrializing state together by 1917 one quarter of the worlds people were under british dominion
4170768 only fifty years after its revolutionary birth a rapid growth in population made the acquisition of more land critical for the united states particularly for the sons of small farmers to preserve their young nation state presidents andrew jackson and martin van buren thereupon authorized the expropriation of native americans
4170769 by 1838 16 000 20 000 cherokees were the only large indian community remaining in the east basing his decision on a fraudulent 1835 treaty president van buren ordered their removal to oklahoma
4170770 leading a militia of 7 000 men general winfield scott oversaw the cherokees 1 200 mile forced march to their new home
4170771 ninety years later as the international economy entered being the wealthiest and most productive industrial nation the u s found it could survive by outcompeting its rivals japan was soon being driven from china and other asian markets while germany suffered the same fate in eastern europe in the early 1930s germanys economy which had never recovered from wwi collapsed
4170772 ordering the stimulation of their nations economies with large scale military spending the leaders of germany and japan predictably chose to employ force so that their states might endure japan occupied manchuria in 1931 in 1939 germany invaded poland early the following year germany conquered norway and france and in mid 1941 it declared war on the soviet union
4170773 by the latter date the war in europe was dealing a fatal blow to japans economy in july 1941 a japanese cabinet planning board reported the war was preventing the importation of machinery from germany and italy or from switzerland through germany or italy which is vitally necessary for the production of strategic materials like germany before it japan was going down for the count
4170774 forced to choose between accepting a destruction of the state or fighting japans leaders undertook an accelerated preparation for war against the u s the competitor whose defensive economic policies were having such a disastrous effect on december 7th 1941 general hideki tojo and emperor hirohito directed the infamous attack on pearl harbor
4170775 nothing ive said should be interpreted as a defense of japan and germany respecting the global conflict that ensued to identify the material reasons for a nations resort to violence is very different from giving it support just as identifying the material origins of an earthquake is different from embracing its devastation
4170776 unlike dr marx being an objectivist i limit my analyses to explaining whats happening and the material reasons why
4170777 that said however as i made clear in my discourses on livy i believe in the greater efficacy of democracy since the united states was more democratic than either japan or germany if forced to take sides during wwii i would have backed the u s
4170778 now to believe in democracy means believing leaders must have the backing of their populations it has always been my position that any leader who fails to gain popular support can not long survive
4170779 however at times like those ive described leaders confront a dilemma
4170780 in order to protect their people they must defend the state to defend the state they must make war to make war successfully they must have their peoples acquiescence if possible their enthusiastic cooperation
4170781 the problem is that making war involves slaughtering and subjugating other humans actions which are universally considered evil it is to our species credit that the people of every nation resist seeing themselves as murderers and oppressors
4170782 in order to gain sufficient popular support for or at least submission to those necessary evils wartime leaders therefore inevitably find that they must lie
4170783 when ordering an attack upon another nation they must lie to defend their countrys reputation lie to get assistance from allies lie to delude their victims as occurred with the cherokees no less important they must lie to soothe the collective conscience of their citizenry unless they lie the forcible domination of another state another people cannot possibly succeed
4170784 fortunately whenever the preservation of the state upon which their lives and fortunes depend is at stake people universally insist upon being provided the requisite protective deceptions
4170785 the americans who settled the west during the 19th century welcomed the justifying lies told about savage and bloodthirsty indians the indians they were exterminating as they found it necessary to seize their land
4170786 when the great depression devastated the world economy in the 1930s most russians embraced stalins fantastic lies about the countrys lies which vindicated holding the soviet state together by killing 7 to 10 million people and enslaving an even greater number of others
4170787 during wwii only a tiny and pragmatically silent minority of germans rejected hitlers utilitarian lie that they were fighting
4170788 to give a final and for most of you a more personal example throughout the 90 years since the russian revolution most americans have reflexively imbibed the remarkable story that the soviet union and subsequently china posed a socialist communist threat to their way of life a lie no less preposterous than that told by the spanish inquisitionists who tortured jews in the name of christ
4170789 at the time dr marx was writing everyone including his detractors understood socialism to mean an equalization of basic income communism the more tender hearted
4170790 as our common experience loudly tells us where apportioning their nations wealth is concerned neither russia nor china has ever been one whit more socialist let alone communist than any other country including the united states
4170791 surely the international correspondents among you have felt the irony of filing reports in which you referred to communist china a country which forbes notes now has 10 billionaires 400 businessmen with personal wealth exceeding 100 million and many thousands of mere millionaires while an army of indigent chinese roams the streets of major cities homeless and hungry
4170792 on the other hand its equally obvious that the incessant lies about a communist menace were critical for rationalizing a military defense of threatened u s industries and investments in asia africa central and south america thereby securing the united states and stabilizing its people lives which of course is why all but a few americans embraced the artifice involved
4170793 while its frequently essential that political leaders lie to others as my student philosopher leo strauss observed particularly in wartime its no less crucial that they do not begin to deceive themselves
4170794 a wartime leader must remain focused on the exclusive objective and associated truth for which he is directing mayhem and telling his lies
4170795 the wartime political leaders objective which he lies to defend ive already told you a preservation of his state his associated truth that objective material understanding which if he can get his people to act upon it through deception will result in the states preservation
4170796 whenever evil must be done to preserve the state an unspoken agreement is made between a leader and his people he will lie to procure their support which requires protecting them from assuming responsibility for the evil
4170797 on their parts the people will either accept the leaders lies as fact or in the case of individuals who are less well served by the states evil acts they will busy themselves with nitpicking demonstrations that particular lies are falacious
4170798 however so long as the state and therefore their lives and livelihoods are being preserved our shared experience tells us they will refrain from seeking the material reasons for the evil being done that is they will not attempt to discover and disclose the leaders personal truth the unique objective vision which is determining his actions and prompting him to deceive
4170799 perhaps the most compelling evidence that the people of every nation prefer comforting fiction to disturbing truth is the universal reluctance to relinquish what were initially pragmatic lies long after their utility has been exhausted
4170800 the majority of japanese have yet to confront the brutality of their countrys attack on nanking in december 1937 two hundred thousand chinese were killed many machine gunned in the street women were
4170801 turkey still adamantly refuses to acknowledge that after its ottoman empire holdings were lost in wwi it maintained itself by massacring one and a half million armenians seizing their properties in order to survive
4170802 very few russians have accepted the breathtaking slaughter of poles lithuanians ukrainians estonians and latvians which the soviet union carried out to preserve its existence during the depression ridden 1930s and 40s
4170803 thirty two years after the vietnam war ended most americans continue to avoid the simple reality that their nation pragmatically defined poor ignorant and uneducated vietnamese laotian and cambodian peasants as communists then butchered over three million of them using every weapon at its disposal rifles bombs napalm cluster bombs 50 caliber machine guns and grenades
4170804 but is it really necessary for me to defend this obvious point robert stinnetts book was published in 2000 using the u s governments official records stinnett documented what admiral robert theobald pulitzer prize winning author john toland and others had convincingly argued two decades before president roosevelt and members of his cabinet not only knew japans attack on pearl harbor was impending they worked to insure that it happened convinced it would unify the public behind what they rightly considered an inevitable war yet today the majority of americans continue to talk of japans surprise attack dismissing as conspiracy kooks those who express the material truth
4170805 its clear from your facial expressions that many of you find my arguments distasteful
4170806 one of the most painful criticisms ive had to endure is that i advocate immorality and evil
4170807 to the contrary ive always insisted the practice of evil should be no greater in dimension and duration than a preservation of the state requires lying killing and related evils are for me strictly means never ends unfortunately they are sometimes the only means by which the states perpetuation and its peoples lives can be secured
4170808 in the hope that you wont misunderstand my position let me be precise if a conquered elites hegemonic way of life can be continued that should always be done and they will thereafter reward the conquerors by helping to keep the masses subdued if the elites favored status can not be sustained one and all of them must be killed for they will never cease plotting a violent restitution of their former authority and rank
4170809 if a subjugated populations way of life can be sustained the velvet glove should always be used in their governance since they will present no tangible threat if their way of life can not be maintained they must either be destroyed or driven from the region because it will not be possible to control them
4170810 do you still find my words disturbing then ask yourself this question should the state be dismantled and its citizenry allowed to suffer socio economic devastation if the alternative is employing violence and deceit if you answer yes please take another look at the real world youll discover when people make that argument they almost always have some other state in mind rather than their own
4170811 to repeat the central tenets of my thesis preserving the state upon which his people depend for their physical economic and social existence must be a leaders foremost objective
4170812 realizing that objective sometimes necessitates making war on another nation
4170813 for all the reasons ive enumerated getting his people to support a war invariably requires a leader to dissemble and deceive
4170814 that said there are two more things a leader must do at such pivotal moments if he would succeed in defending his state
4170815 based upon a clear headed understanding of the material necessity for initiating a war and the wars specific objectives the leader must formulate a strategic plan
4170816 what makes a micromanaged strategy vital whenever a leader takes his state from peace to war this is another question you can give an objective material answer if you examine your own behavior
4170817 your family has no need for a micromanaged plan when following its normal routine however any sharp break with that routine such as a camping trip immediately makes it essential
4170818 you will need to plan your destination date of departure method of travel and length of stay and numerous aspects of the trip will have to be micromanaged in order for it to be a success
4170819 if you determine to go by car someone must assess its mechanical condition you will have to decide whos going to do the driving the approximate amount of fuel and food needed who will prepare the food the kind and quantity of clothing required along with responsibility for a host of other matters like tents bicycles fishing licenses and equipment perhaps arranging for friends or relatives to be visited along the way
4170820 so it is when a states leader determines to take his people to war except that where lies arent normally required for a camping trip as the genuinely candid among you are well aware theyre an integral feature of every nations resort to war
4170821 which brings us finally to the u s war in iraq
4170822 ill begin this part of my discussion by asking the critical
4170823 faced with brutal competition from japan and other industrialized nations which enjoyed significantly lower labor costs by the late 1960s major u s corporations were in serious trouble
4170824 the two leading auto manufacturers initially tried to weather the challenge by cybernating production then by making cars of low cost and consequently low quality in 1971 ford motors introduced the
4170825 but gm and ford were soon made to understand that producing cars of inferior quality would not enable them to hang on very long
4170826 with no alternative remaining if they wished to stay competitive general motors and ford then began outsourcing large parts of their manufacturing operations to low wage countries
4170827 u s manufacturers of nearly every product power tools furniture canned food skis clothing radios and tvs were soon reluctantly taking the same path
4170828 dr marx and his disciples would have us believe capitalists are driven by an insatiable lust for increased profit
4170829 business economists on the other hand consider it axiomatic that corporations hesitate to move their operations abroad until the rising tide of competition is threatening to drown them the activities of general motors ford levis jeans dewalt and milwaukee power tools thomas mccann shoes ibm dell computers hershey chocolate and hundreds of other companies have objectively verified that proposition
4170830 while the outsourcing of manufacture meant millions of american workers were losing their jobs a consequent devastation of the u s economy was prevented by the high technology revolution which occurred during the 1980s and 90s the birth of the internet and an on line global market along with the application of digitalized information to everything from experimental science to education medicine audio communication and movie making quite literally saved the day
4170831 dozens of high tech companies sprung into existence lavishly funded by venture capitalists many were soon included in fortune 500s list of most profitable corporations
4170832 the computer savvy entrepreneurs who founded the high tech industries often became multi millionaires almost overnight as did investors in their novel operations
4170833 in the late 1990s the high tech revolution gave birth to the dot com phenomenon thousands of internet web sites offering products and advice of every imaginable kind health charity the environment pets politics education finance jewelry travel book publishing furniture making and home restoration etc
4170834 venture capitalists and investors again provided hundreds of billions of dollars for these remarkable operations and again sudden fortunes were made
4170835 fitness centers opened in towns and cities across the country occupations like personal trainer landscape artist interior decorator massage therapist and herbal medicine specialist acquired new respect and wider application bike shops and boat yards manufacturers sellers and repairmen of atvs and trailers restaurants coffee shops and jewelery stores travel agents and luxury liner operators orthodontists and cosmetic dentists mini storage owners makers and installers of pools spas and home theaters one and all profitted from the surge of wealth in large cities three four and five thousand square foot homes became common place
4170836 you heard me correctly not seven million dollars not seven billion seven trillion
4170837 but ive only begun to described the united states troubled situation as the 21st century opened
4170838 with the collapse of the dot coms the growth rate of the u s economy plummeted from 3 7 in 2 000 to 0 8 in 2001 in 2002 it was still a modest 1 6
4170839 meanwhile the annual growth rate of chinas industrializing economy had risen from 8 3 in 2001 to 9 1 in 2002 indias economy was also growing at a rate more than double that of the u s 4 1 in 2001 4 2 in 2002
4170840 although a phenomenal increase in trade between the u s china and india was making the three nations economies increasingly interdependent china and india were beginning to pose a challenge to the u s in many countries including in chinas case those of the middle east
4170841 which brings me to the united states paramount concern in that region the concern which led it to attack and occupy iraq and which if your countrys leaders continue to act defensively will soon lead it to saturation bomb numerous targets in iran
4170842 that paramount concern you know as well as i do
4170843 in case you havent noticed the economy of every industrialized nation floats on oil
4170844 a majority of the things industrial countries make use or sell are at least partially made from oil derivatives tooth brushes soaps and soap dishes clothing telephones furniture fertilizers cosmetics lacquers television cases and park benches
4170845 homes are heated with it and cars trains ships and planes are wholly dependent upon its availability at a moderate price
4170846 the pool of oil guzzling industrial nations is also growing and the two most competitive industrializing countries india and china are huge and hungry
4170847 chinas exports soared from 10 billion in 1978 to 278 billion in 2000 sixth largest trading nation in the world with a gdp growth rate thats sometimes double digit its thirst for oil is becoming unquenchable yet except for da qing which produces an estimated one million barrels a day china has no reserves worth consideration
4170848 chinas consumption of oil is growing by 7 percent a year in the year 2003 04 it shot up 19 percent and given the countrys phenomenal growth rate it may well increase by double digits again indias oil consumption is also increasing by more than 5 percent every year
4170849 as you may know the united states per day consumption of oil is 20 7 million barrels more than germany france japan india and chinas combined 19 5 million barrels
4170850 the u s consumes 26 percent of the worlds oil production three times more than it produces and like chinas the rate of its oil consumption and importation continues to grow during the 1980s the u s imported 30 percent of its oil today it imports 50 percent
4170851 unfortunately while the international competition for oil is becoming daily more aggressive the amount of oil thats readily still talking material reality here is in serious decline
4170852 theres been a lot of debate about whether the worlds approaching is at or has already passed that critical stage at which half of the easily obtainable oil has been tapped and production begins to decline
4170853 back in 1956 shell geologist dr m king hubbert was criticized for predicting peak oil production in the u s would occur sometime between 1965 and 1970 it happened in 1970 hubberts predicted peak for world production was 2006
4170854 no one disputes hubberts fundamental thesis about an impending peak oil crisis any longer its a matter of quibbling over the specifics of when
4170855 paul appleby british petroleums chief economist believes the worlds oil output will flatten then
4170856 fredrik robelius of sweden who wrote a doctoral thesis on the subject thinks world wide peak oil production will occur between 2008 and 2018
4170857 other equally informed observers insist peak oil has already happened
4170858 jim buckee who earned a doctorate in astrophysics at oxford university and now heads the canadian oil and natural gas company talisman energy came to that conclusion
4170859 after researching the subject so did t boone pickens the famous investment tycoon
4170860 princeton professor emeritus dr kenneth deffeyes is very specific proposing the peak in world oil production occurred on thanksgiving day 2005
4170861 the point is most oil men and scientists agree that while the world isnt about to run out of oil it is about to run low the peak in worldwide production definitely happening before 2020 in all probability before 2015
4170862 no less alarming the impending crisis in oil production has already begun to strike the worlds leading producer saudi arabia
4170863 university of california professor stuart staniford who edits the highly regarded website
4170864 already half the daily output of ghawar the worlds largest oil field and saudi arabias most productive from which 6 25 percent of the worlds oil is even oil its water
4170865 the largest most productive deposits of high grade readily extracted oil are in three middle eastern countries saudi arabia iraq and iran
4170866 the number of new deposits being discovered is discouragingly small and none contain the huge amounts of low sulphur oil of fields in the middle east
4170867 at the same time many of the worlds major oil fields including those of saudi arabia are showing signs of depletion and becoming increasingly costly to tap
4170868 if the u s china or one or more european state could put the lock on the remaining middle eastern oil it would be able to dominate the world economy outcompeting other nations and or controlling their production respecting a cornucopia of goods including agricultural produce and military hardware
4170869 lets not be timid about describing the united states problematic situation if china or some combination of european industrial countries acquires a monopoly on mid east oil in only a few years time it will be able to wreck the u s economy reducing americans to the poverty and dependence currently suffered by many third world populations
4170870 given the interdependence of the worlds national economies would china or europe ever do such a terrible thing to another country
4170871 the great depression demonstrated how brutally indifferent to one anothers situations nations become when the very survival of the state is in jeopardy
4170872 and the threat of another global depression of the kind that produced world wars i and ii is always with us
4170873 surely none of you are prepared to argue we have international instiitutions in place which
4170874 do you doubt that the u s faces the imminent challenge ive been describing
4170875 in the spring of 2002 investigative journalist jeremy scahill attended the 30th anniversary celebration of the nationalization of iraqs oil during a subsequent interview scahill reported
4170876 these two fields had been allocated to two companies scahill continued one of them french the other russian but because of u s pressure and u n sanctions the russians and the french never began drilling
4170877 tired of waiting for the sanctions removal rashid declared iraq had decided to go ahead with the french russian explorations for which each of those countries was committed to investing billions of dollars
4170878 iraq predicted that by tapping the west qurna and majnoon fields it would be able to
4170879 was this mere wishful thinking on iraqs part or was it a reasonable assumption
4170880 in other words respecting the product most vital for the survival of every industrial nation the u s would then be able to dictate to the rest of the world
4170881 i think we can assume scahills conclusion was apparent to american oil company executives as well as u s neocon leaders
4170882 nine months after rashid made his startling declaration the u s
4170883 now consider the material threat which china the oil parched colossus poses in the middle east
4170884 in reviewing that threat ill simply rely on world press citations
4170885 beijings target is to quadruple its economy by 2020 as it did from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s
4170886 prior to the u s invasion of iraq in march 2003 china made two failed attempts to obtain that countrys oil it negotiated
4170887 the u s severed diplomatic relations with iran in april 1980 following the seizure of 63 american embassy workers the previous year
4170888 this fast growing symbiotic union of the chinese and iranian economies has involved china selling iran ever larger quantities of manufacture in addition to buying its liquid natural gas and its oil
4170889 arab news noted partnerships between iranian companies and south korean french and japanese firms helped make iran the middle easts leading car producer in 2005 with an output totaling china is also reputed to be building an iranian auto plant for the manufacture of a low priced model while the u s stands and watches
4170890 as forecast by concerned observers around the world the reciprocal trade between china and iran is continuing its phenomenal rate of growth
4170891 nor are chinas overtures to the middle east being directed exclusively at iran in november 2003 the united arab emirates observed that trade between china and the seven small states which comprise the uae had grown by 42 8 percent during the first nine months of that year alone
4170892 no less disturbing from the united states and israels perspective for more than 20 years china has been providing iran with the latest weaponry including missiles
4170893 chinas missile trade and cooperation with iran has been a subject of substantial proliferation concern in washington since the chinas missile exports and assistance to iran have generally fallen into the provision of anti ship cruise missiles and related technology and technical assistance for irans ballistic missile program as well as some exports of complete ballistic missiles
4170894 in other words iran has been rapidly moving toward the point at which it willl be able to defend itself against an attempt by another state to take its oil by force
4170895 youll understand im not exaggerating when i say that as the 21st century opened the u s was approaching a fateful juncture
4170896 fortunately unlike most americans being perceptive machiavellians presi er vice president cheney and his neocon subordinates have been able to assemble all the pieces of the puzzle
4170897 the industrial world is heading for a showdown over control of the middle easts oil
4170898 if china or europe were to win the struggle given that international competition for the sale of manufacture is already intense and much of the u s productive base is now located abroad in the event of an international depression it seems virtually certain america would suffer the fate of germany and japan in the 1930s
4170899 however the neocons have recognized that western europe isnt a serious competitor in the battle for middle east oil
4170900 in comparison with chinas european economies are only treading water
4170901 in addition germany and france are able to buy enough oil and natural gas from russia to keep their homes heated their cars and factories running besides eighty percent of frances electrical needs are being supplied with nuclear power not oil
4170902 germany and france would doubtlessly like to profit from the acquisition of large quantities of mid east oil but doing so isnt a dire necessity
4170903 so the conflict over control of the middle easts oil is between those two states and whichever one wins will have the final word when it comes to determining the international practice if an international depression occurred even the survival of the other
4170904 due to the economic interdependence of the two countries the victor will need to consider the interests of the vanquished but which state gives and which receives consideration is going to be of the greatest historical consequence
4170905 you americans are fortunate that several leading neocons are former trotskyists who once naively supposed that when a country commits to dr marxs communist vision it undergoes a utopian transformation
4170906 believing the failure of china and the soviet union to construct free egalitarian and humane socialist systems was of monumental significance they are now dedicated to protecting the united states as it builds a better world
4170907 irving kristol the former trotskyist whos variously referred to as the godfather of the neocon movement expressed these sentiments lucidly writing
4170908 it is not too much to say that the collapse of the socialist ideal is the most striking event in the history of political thought in this century
4170909 optimistic and still devoted to moving the species forward the neocons grasp the importance of the u s winning this struggle
4170910 for over two centuries america has symbolized freedom democracy and economic opportunity to the entire world
4170911 china on the contrary represents religious repression thought control and a heavy handed social economic and political manipulation
4170912 in the u s dissidents are criticized sometimes ridiculed in china theyre imprisoned or shot
4170913 tens of millions of people around the globe dream of becoming american citizens millions risk injury or arrest every year in order to enter the country illegally hundreds dying of heat stroke and thirst in the deserts of new mexico and arizona
4170914 no foreigners dream of moving to china or jeopardize their lives trying to do it
4170915 your neocons realize that more than the future of the united states is at stake the western world whose very way of life values and traditions the u s represents and defends now stands in peril
4170916 they recognize it isnt a question of whether the united states
4170917 however the neocons also understand that china and the u s would both be ill served by a public acknowledgement of the battle their economies are much too interdependent for that
4170918 in addition only japan holds a larger portion of the u s foreign debt than china 644 billion and 350 billion respectively
4170919 considerable pressure to severely restrict these mutually beneficial relations is already exerted by american labor unions and by small manufacturers whose oxen are being gored
4170920 if the u s china conflict over control of middle east oil were openly declared that pressure could become irresistable
4170921 the critical question for the neocons in the year 2000 then was how the u s should go about waging this silent but nonetheless epic battle i e
4170922 unlike during the great depression economic competition will not work
4170923 few american made products can compete with chinese manufacture here in the u s they are even less competitive in the middle east
4170924 as economist robert j samuelson recently observed china doesnt have only 17 percent of its workers have pensions and a mere 14 percent are covered by unemployment insurance factor in its workers low wages and its obvious that china has the upper hand where selling the middle east manufacture is concerned
4170925 nor can the u s compete when it comes to buying the oil given the huge sums of money that must be paid to individuals and institutions who hold oil company stock and stock in corporations like haliburton which are involved with many aspects of drilling shipping and processing oil along with the exorbitant salaries of the executives employed by those firms its clear chinas state operated companies can afford to be far more generous than u s corporations
4170926 to sum the united states fundamental dilemma its survival as well as maintenance of its dominant world position requires that it gain unchallenged control of middle east oil determining which countries obtain what amounts and at what price and that in doing so it receives the lions share of profit coming from the oil
4170927 in november 2002 four months before the u s began bombing iraq the canadian investment firm union securities limited posted a very terse but very accurate description of the problematic situation the neocons confronted writing
4170928 in 1950 the united states supplied roughly 52 percent of the worlds oil production
4170929 beginning in the 1950s defending its third world interests from expropriation has required the united states to radically increase its production and sale of weaponry the arms sales have then helped it compensate for the competitive edge it was losing respecting the sale of manufacture in general
4170930 as a consequence since the 1990s the u s has been responsible for approximately 45 percent of all international arms transactions according to the congressional research service the value of u s arms sales was 18 6 billion for the year 2000 alone
4170931 most of the leading neocons have defense department histories vice president richard cheney served as secretary of defense under president h w bush donald rumsfeld was secretary of defense during both bush presidencies richard perle was assistant secretary of defense for president reagan paul wolfowitz served as deputy secretary of defense under g w bush eric edelman is presently the undersecretary of defense for policy and douglas feith has held various defense department positions
4170932 these men know well that no country least of all china can match the vast array or the sophistication of u s weapons systems reconnaissance satellites b 52 bombers equipped with smart bombs cluster bombs and bunker busters unmanned predators able to track a vehicle in near silence then blow it away with a guided missile black hawk apache kiowa warrior and chinook helicopters avenger and patriot ground to air defense systems abrams tanks bradleys m88a2 hercules armored vehicles depleted uranium tipped anti tank missiles and if needed the latest in chemical and biological weaponry research on which congress granted the national institutes of health 1 76 billion in 2006
4170933 on march 19th 2003 the bush neocons answered union securities rhetorical question they ordered that the shock and awe bombing of iraq begin and to date they have continued to follow my instructions with ingenuity and brilliance
4170934 you will recall my advice to leaders who must take their states to war in order to preserve them
4170935 in 2003 the neocons understood it would be impossible for the u s to preserve the status of the iraqi majority whatever their class
4170936 education to the highest university level and cradle to grave health care was free for most iraqis women enjoyed basic equality drove cars and wore western clothing many were physicians lawyers judges chemists and professors
4170937 for more than 35 years saddam hussein a megalomaniac with a stalinist personality had entertained dreams of doing what egypts gamel abdel nasser was unable to do unify the arab world then use its vast oil wealth to modernize the middle east
4170938 saddam recognized that doing so would be no easy task iraqs population is comprised of a shia majority many of whom are among its poorest citizens a sunni minority from which most of the wealthiest iraqis were drawn a large kurdish minority in the north small rural communities ruled by warlords and other numerically insignificant ethnic or religious populations including chistians with so many divergent groups having divergent interests the baathists industrialization program inevitably did serious injury to one or another of them at various times particularly the shia and the kurds
4170939 whenever any group dared to engage in disruption however mild saddam used abject torture and terror to drive them back in line
4170940 it was evident to the neocons that having taken control of iraq the united states would not be able to cede enough oil money to maintain the cushy life style of its elite body of military officers businessmen lawyers judges scientists physicians politicians and entertainers or the comfortable existence of its large middle class
4170941 protecting the united states own economy would require that much of the profit be used to remunerate its oil corporation stockholders and executives along with the heads of american firms like bechtel and haliburton which would need to operate in iraq in order to maintain the flow of oil and u s domination they in turn would use a portion of their swollen incomes to employ thousands of other americans in building and maintaining private planes sail boats ski lodges and mansions for them and their families at home
4170942 in addition getting france germany japan england and china to submit to u s control of the middle easts oil would make it imperative that they be able to buy sufficient amounts of it cheaply enough to keep their own economies running smoothly given the integration of the global economy the indicated sharing of the take would not be an act of charity it would be a necessity if the u s was going to continue exporting and importing goods profitably
4170943 far more important is the extravagant cost of the instrument the united states finds it must employ to gain control of the middle easts oil china has been using the free market approach well pay top dollar for your oil and natural gas and sell you low priced manufacture in return it offers an arrangement which has no attendant expenses
4170944 however military force the only competitive device available to the u s in this instance is inordinately expensive in september 2002 lawrence lindsey then the presidents economic adviser estimated a war with iraq would cost between 100 and 200 billion it has already cost over 300 billion and estimates of the total price if the war continues for another few years run as high as 2 trillion
4170945 at the moment the u s is putting much of this remarkable expense on the tab with japan and ironically china but eventually someone will have to begin to pay with its economy already under great strain that someone cant be the united states while their plan hasnt started working yet the neocons prewar prediction was that the u s would buy the weaponry used to dominate iraq with profit from iraqi oil when the expenses previously mentioned are included that would leave very little for the iraqis
4170946 where obtaining the middle easts oil is concerned china and the u s might be compared to guests at a pot luck dinner china is able to bring a dish and put it on the table with dishes brought by others and those provided by the host the united states only option is to arrive empty handed and declare everybody away from the table im going to eat not a very friendly approach perhaps but the only one open to the neocons if they would preserve their state and western culture
4170947 under the circumstances the u s had no choice in order to seize control of iraqs oil and profitably determine its distribution it would have to do the following
4170948 annihilate not only saddam the countrys prince but a large section of the iraqi elite the military officers judges doctors lawyers university presidents engineers and chemists who would otherwise disruptively demand a continuation of their favored situations
4170949 kill or drive from the country a few million middle class iraqis whose statuses it would likewise be impossible to sustain
4170950 destroy the economic political and judicial system through which the baathists held power including the symbols of their authority
4170951 raze the infrastructure vital to the countrys existence its electrical grids telephone water and sewage systems its colleges and universities rail lines and bridges this would help to force middle class iraqis out of the country by reducing their living standard to the bare survival level
4170952 then it would be necessary to break the country into several pieces assigning control over each piece to that economically poorest group which would be capable of defending both its own authority and u s dominion over the oil
4170953 surely you can now understand the material truth of my claim that lies arent merely useful when a leader must direct the annihilation of another people in order to save his state they are essential
4170954 consider the insane consequences if the neocons had chosen to be honest prior to the
4170955 we intend to traumatize the iraqi population by ripping out the arteries of their state eradicating its army destroying its hospitals universities highways and bridges its water purification systems and electricity generating plants
4170956 we will make the sunnis and shiites situations so desperate that they turn upon each other to survive
4170957 we are going to urge shia slum dwellers to vent the frustration and rage long smouldering in their hearts by robbing and killing those who have the things theyve been denied the countrys professionals its doctors lawyers chemists and professors
4170958 we are preparing to dispatch more than 130 000 highly trained mercenaries drawn from around the world the coldest most ruthless men we are able find
4170959 simultaneous with cleansing iraq of individuals who might present a troublesome opposition we are going to construct huge heavily fortified military bases from which we will direct an equally necessary destructive conquest of other mid east states sometime in the near future
4170960 in case some of you still dont get it respecting the indispensable function of lies let me end my opening argument with an analogy
4170961 imagine a fisherman who puts his net in the water then throws in bait to attract the fish its called chumming and it works the fish become so intent on eating the bait that it never occurs to them they are themselves about to be caught and eaten
4170962 so it is with the neocon deceptions about iraq like fish feeding on chum liberal opponents of the war have focused on obsessed about the lies successfully distracted from the material realities the lies are told to camouflage
4170963 in short liberal opponents of the war have been using the very neocon lies they claim to reject to evaluate events in iraq a downright mind boggling activity when you think about it in doing so they contemplate failure at every turn the countrywide destruction the raw sewage in baghdads drinking water the suicide bombings with 80 to 100 innocent people killed every day the 4 million iraqis who have abandoned their homes 2 million fleeing to syria and jordan
4170964 all the while vice president cheney employs the neocons material strategy and objectives to judge the same events and with a condescending smile on his face he assures reporters that all is going well
4170965 to cheney its blatantly evident that the mercenaries and american forces are creating the chaotic destruction required for the u s to gain unchallenged control of iraq and its oil
4170966 its equally evident to him the neocons lies are working just as intended
4170967 conservative americans continue to support the war enthusiastically while the liberal opposition fumes and fusses about neocon lies being demonstratively false studiously avoiding any materialist analyses of the war as though just touching the subject might prove fatal
4170968 they write email phone and finance presidential and congressional candidates who urge the u s must withdraw from iraq ignoring the overwhelming material evidence it isnt going to happen no matter who occupies the white house and the congress a point made by retired air force lieutenant karen kwiatkowski who served as a pentagon analyst and desk officer immediately prior to the war
4170969 in defense of that proposition kwiatkowski referred to the four u s
4170970 all four of the bases al asad air base balad air base camp fallujah and camp taqaddum are able to accommodate the largest planes the neocons had them built to serve as launching platforms from which other middle east countries can be monitored and when necessary attacked their function and what can actually be done about them are grand scale material issues the neocons opposition almost never discuss
4170971 then theres the 700 million u s embassy constructed in the heavily secured green zone while no meaningful effort has been made to provide baghdad residents living outside the green zone with basic necessities like potable water and electricity the embassy is approaching completion covering 104 acres an area larger than the vatican its the biggest embassy in the world but its objective purpose and what can or should be done with it are likewise critical material questions about which opponents of the war are silent
4170972 the iraq war opposition also avoids the troublesome material issue of the mercenaries operating and killing in iraq their number equal to that of u s forces
4170973 now im going to tie the only remaining loose thread of my argument
4170974 you will recall that the need for leaders who take their states from peace to war to formulate a clear headed strategy which they micromanage is a central axiom of my theory
4170975 it should be evident the neocons have done both things
4170976 lieutenant colonel kwiatkowski among the few members of the anti war faction who seem to sense whats going on wrote of the
4170977 mark halperin teddy davis tahman bradley matthew zavala paul fidalgo and others have accused cheney of micromanaging the media and indeed he did cheney micromanaged the
4170978 karl rove president bushs senior political adviser was said to micromanage everything that came out of the white house to insure it accorded with the neocons mysterious agenda
4170979 reporter seymour hersh wrote of defense secretary donald rumsfelds obsessive micromanaging and bob woodward elaborated upon in it his book state of denial according to woodward rumsfeld was involved with every aspect of military operations sending out a constant flurry of memoes his subordinates called snow flakes and acquiring the dismissive appellation machiavellian steadfastly refusing to look for their strategic material objective which by definition a machiavellian must have anti war liberals have gone on to accuse the neocons of micromanaging that undiscovered for the liberals non existent objective
4170980 only an idiot would behave that way of course and i assure you the neocons are anything but idiots maddeningly the liberals then project their own inadequacy on the neo cons describing them as
4170981 which brings me back to the matter of why people desire being lied to when preserving the state that sustains them requires the brutalization of another people the lies i observed provide the majority with a justification for the killing while enabling others to engage in make believe resistance puzzled by events dragged complainingly along after the leader who prescribes the necessary evil
4170982 when the killing is finally over those whove played the role of make believe resisters are invariably found to support the results of the destruction with what they comfort themselves are clear consciences and clean hands characterizing them as the best that can be achieved in a bad situation
4170983 some liberal opponents of the iraq war have already begun moving in that direction
4170984 the daily killing and displacement taking place in iraq aims at achieving three iraqi parts which will be sectarian and ethnically pure as a prelude to iraqs partition
4170985 a few anti iraq war liberals have now publicly backed

4171032 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4171033 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4171034 this research will give us information that allows us to identify what treatment is going to be effective in what individual by genotype by obesity and other factors what kind of treatment is going to be effective at keeping an individuals blood pressure down or maybe preventing it from ever getting high
4171035 we think there is a defect in their kidneys in the normal mechanisms that allow them to excrete salt
4171036 when blood pressure goes up due to stress their kidneys ought to get rid of more salt so their blood pressure will come down and they dont
4171037 we have animal model data that says the endothelin system normally functions to help your kidneys get rid of salt
4171038 from our point of view angiotensin promotes sodium retention directly and it also increases aldosterone another hormone which promotes sodium retention
4171039 ultimately you want to know how to treat people with this variation
4171040 there is still a need to figure out why some people respond to some therapies and other dont
4171041 that is not our specific question but these studies will help address that we have to identify what is it about different individuals that make them react more to stress makes them retain more salt
4171042 we are arguing in our study that you might want to treat patients differently depending on whether or not they are obese the angiotensin receptor blocker may be more effective in obese individuals who have angiotensin falling out into their bloodstream
4171043 we also found out that endothelin actually is the stimulus for increasing reactive oxygen species
4171044 when we gave the rats a specific type of endothelin blocker that also blocked the increase in oxidative stress blocked the blood pressure increase and improved recovery
4171045 this early life stressor is being mediated through the endothelin pathway
4171046 we took that to mean their blood pressure could also be hyper reactive sure enough that is what we found
4171047 this has a lot of implications for earlier detection of risk increasing environmental exposures and what you can do about it
4171048 if you cant alter the environment that quickly in life you know now where they are headed and maybe you can preempt it pharmacogenetically
4171049 what we are doing is looking at chronic environmental stress in combination with some bad candidate genes that are stress activated
4171050 if you have a tendency to have high blood pressure or if you are obese we can see the inner layer of the carotid getting thicker than normal people your age

4171052 we the undersigned petition the prime minister to respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
4171053 the irish referendum on the lisbon treaty has resulted in a decisive no vote however politicians across europe are calling for the ratification of the treaty to go ahead the british government are planning to put the lisbon treaty to its third and final reading in the lords next wednesday 18 june this would complete its ratification in the uk we believe that the prime minister should respect the result of the irish referendum and abandon the attempt to ratify the lisbon treaty
4171054 the rules of the treaty and the eu are clear all 27 member states must ratify the treaty for it to come into force there is no question of ignoring the irish vote or bulldozing irish opinion ireland clearly cannot be bound by changes which it has not ratified equally there is no appetite for a return to years of institutional negotiation the eu as a whole needs to find a way forward for all countries that allows the eu to focus on the big policy issues that confront us

4171062 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage
4171063 however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
4171064 it is essential that all farmers ensure that the equipment they are using is well maintained and regularly inspected to prevent similar tragedies occurring
4171065 they must also make sure their employees are trained in safe working practices
4171066 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4171067 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4171068 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4171069 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4171070 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on
4171071 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4171072 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4171073 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab

4171111 the arroyo administration is really asking for it it is courting mass protest actions on a nationwide scale the next month will be crucial in generating momentum versus charter change the filipino people will have to deliver an olympian effort in trying to defeat once and for all arroyos ambitions of staying in power
4171112 no matter how hard malacanang tries to deny its ambitions of a term extension nobody is buying it this government suffers from zero credibility everyone is suspicious of the self serving interests of mrs arroyo
4171113 she lied before about not running in 2004 she lied again regarding election fraud nothing in her track record shows that she wont lie again regarding the 2010 elections
4171114 charter change by whatever mode at this time under the arroyo regime will always be suspect people know that with all her perceived crimes against the people arroyo would not want to step down and lose immunity after 2010
4171115 the anti charter change campaign will be done at the grassroots level in the communities parishes offices schools and factories charter change and term extension will be opposed every step of the way

4171127 thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind gropeth in darkness
4171128 thou shall not prosper in thy ways and thou shall be only oppressed and spoiled evermore and no man shall save thee thou shall betroth a wife and another man shall lie with her thou shall build a house and thou shall not dwell therein thou shalt plant vineyards and shalt not gather the grapes thereof
4171129 thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all the day long and there shall be no might in thine hand
4171130 the fruit of thy land and all thy labors shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see
4171131 the lord shall bring thee and thy king unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shall thou serve other gods wood and stone
4171132 the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very low
4171133 he shall lend to thee vs 44 and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shall be the tail
4171134 for behold in those days and at that time when i shall bring again the captivity captives of judah and jerusalem israelites jews vs 2 i will also gather all nations and bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land of israel vs 3 and they have cast lots for my people and given a boy for an harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink vs 4 what have you to do with me o tyre and zidon and all the coast of palestine middle east will you render me a recompense pay me back repay me and if you recompense repay me swiftly and speedily will i return your recompense upon your own head vs 5 because you have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things vs 6 the children also of judah and the children of jerusalem israelites have ye sold unto the grecians greeks that you might remove them far from their border
4171135 thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter vs 5 whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich and their own shepherds pity them not
4171136 but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore
4171137 who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come
4171138 these two nations and these two countries speaking of judah and samaria shall be theirs edoms in possession and they will possess it whereas the lord was there
4171139 thus said the lord god because the enemy has said aha even the ancient high places are ours in possession
4171140 i know the blasphemy by those who say they are jews i e judahites thus israelites and are not but are a synagogue of satan
4171141 behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee
4171142 strictly speaking it is incorrect to call an ancient israelite a jew or to call a contemporary jew an israelite or a hebrew
4171143 and are not they todays jews the inventors of the chosen people myth
4171144 i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men
4171145 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel
4171146 these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel
4171147 those rumors are just rumors and i dont think theyre going to stop no matter how many times i say no its not happening because somebody will say he said yes his eyes said yes his nose said yes there was a yes iness about him because people want it

4171160 the olympics is a big platform where everyone wants to showcase their best that includes people who are not happy with china its policies actions and pursuits by getting chinas attention or the attention of the whole world they believe they can make their statements and solve their problems whether they are legitimate or not the olympics is simply not the place for them
4171161 in the west a big crowd is fertile land for attention grabbing you can crash parties and make mischief in china when the host is throwing a big party e tiquette demands that guests refrain from outrageous behavior that may upset the host the beijing olympics is like a wedding neighbors do not show up to conduct business but rather to celebrate
4171162 the opening ceremonies of the beijing olympics were a spectacular show
4171163 this highly anticipated and in many ways controversial event there ha d been hardly any good news
4171164 t the narrative from most of the western media has been something like this back in 2001 china promised to behave and improve its human rights records in exchange for hosting the games but has broken its promises there is more repression of tibetans and other minorities more jailing of dissidents more harassment of the foreign press more pollution more censorship in short china is not democratizing
4171165 some of these concerns are genuine and understandable after all the olympics is a great occasion for people from around world to celebrate the human spirit and to bring us all closer together as a global family the host nation is called upon to live up to high expectations china must learn to live with international scrutiny and with protests both inside and outside its borders but the heavy reporting of negative news is painting an incomplete picture
4171166 well informed chinese believe china has made considerable strides in human rights in the past seven years china has lifted some 100 million people out of poverty despite severe limitations there are hundreds of new legislative enactments that protect property rights and workers rights china has abolished a system that restricted freedom of movement among regions and citizens can hold on to their passports to travel abroad the supreme peoples court now reviews all death sentences and china has joined more international human rights treaties
4171167 there are serious problems of implementation and of government interference but these tangible steps are moving china toward the rule of law the government still interferes still rounds up severe critics and has made life harder for foreign reporters since the tibetan crisis in march but chinas progress since 2001 has been largely along the positive trajectory of the past three decades
4171168 do chinese leaders ever wish they had never agreed to stage the olympics probably not but they may well have mixed feelings yet the games have been a right pain too for the chinese leadership the event has turned into an irresistible magnet for human rights activists to protest many issues from tibet to darfur today christian activists were arrested at tiananmen square where hundreds of pro democracy demonstrators were killed in 1989
4171169 t he chinese are notoriously thin skinned when it comes to criticism and will not appreciate bushs words no matter where they were said in chinese eyes what countries do at home is their own business chinese leaders dont pass judgment on others domestic policies and they dont expect other governments to comment on chinas internal affairs this is the doctrine of state sovereignty at its most rigid
4171170 this not only resulted in an unsafe work environment but led to the contamination of the interior of the range
4171171 between 2006 and 2007 violations continued at the range and the plaintiffs continued to complain
4171172 the last incident occurred in july 2007 when a range executive allowed hollywood actor brendan fraser to utilize machine guns at the range using leaded ammunition
4171173 as it was cheaper and worked with these types of guns
4171174 brendan fraser actually complained about the smoke and he was warned to wash his hands face and clothing before returning home
4171175 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy
4171176 rarely did research designs include a comparison group that was otherwise equivalent to women who had an elective abortion impairing the ability to draw conclusions about relative risks
4171177 following discovery of pregnancy and prior to abortion 40 45 of women experience significant levels of anxiety and around 20 experience significant levels of depressive symptoms distress reduces following abortion but up to around 30 of women are still experiencing emotional problem after a month
4171178 the proportion of women with high levels of anxiety in the month following abortion ranged from 19 27 with 3 9 reporting high levels of depression the better quality studies suggested that 8 32 of women were experiencing high levels of distress
4171179 given the state of the literature a simple calculation of effect sizes or count of the number of studies that showed an effect in one direction versus another was considered inappropriate
4171180 the tfmha evaluated all empirical studies published in english in peer reviewed journals post 1989 that compared the mental health of women who had an induced abortion to the mental health of comparison groups of women n 50 or that examined factors that predict mental health among women who have had an elective abortion in the united states n 23
4171181 the analyses presented in table 3 of the article do not incorporate controls for variables identified as significant predictors of abortion higher education and income and smaller family size these associations between pregnancy outcome and depression are troubling since lower education and income and larger family size predicted depression see table 4 without the controls the delivery group which is associated with lower education and income and larger families will have more depression variance erroneously attributed to pregnancy resolution among the unmarried white women 30 of those in the abortion group had scores exceeding the clinical cut off for depression compared to 16 of the delivery group statistical significance is likely to have been achieved with the controls instituted this group is important to focus on as unmarried white women represent the segment of the u s population obtaining the majority of abortions failure to convey the most scientifically defensible information is inexcusable when the data set contains the necessary variables i strongly urge the authors to run these analyses curiously in all the comparisons throughout the article the authors neglect to control for family size without any explanation
4171182 the abortion debate is so highly charged that a state of respectful listening on either side is almost impossible to achieve
4171183 i collected it and took it to the vet for treatment and thats when we discovered it had a very unusual microchip
4171184 i nicknamed it herman the german and set about trying to track the owner down
4171185 i was told to contain the cat and keep it in isolation while defra tried to trace it but they were unable to
4171186 so after four months in isolation i was told the cat could be rehomed
4171187 she barely recognised the cat because shes so fat from lying about in a cage for so long but shes a very happy and very lucky owner

4171214 something tragic happens and there are people who take advantage of it and dont do their jobs they are responsible for taking care of those who didnt do anything wrong that sentence was a slap in the face david was a great person and its really sad theres no accountability no responsibility today the whole situation is unfortunate for what he took away i dont think 21 days is appropriate its a tragedy
4171215 we have to look at the defendant and his background and the facts of the case we consult with family members and make what we feel is an appropriate sentence the purpose of a sentence is rehabilitation punishment and deterrence

4171219 if you eat the foods you truly enjoy and savor them on a daily basis it can help you feel satisfied with less food

4171242 at this time i am announcing my resignation as a coach of baseball and girls basketball at deering high school effective immediately
4171243 after the revelation of recent events involving the deering high school baseball team i feel this is the appropriate decision for me at this point in my coaching career
4171244 first i want to make it clear that i did nothing wrong and this resignation should in no way infer to anyone an admission of improper actions the scrutiny this event has placed on me during the investigation has only confirmed the growing feelings that i have had over the last several years
4171245 coaching two sports at the varsity level has taken a tremendous amount of my time and i no longer feel the rewards meet the energy and work required to meet the expectation levels i set for my teams and myself
4171246 while i have been fortunate enough to experience considerable success as a head coach it is the memories of the players i have worked with that will forever stay in my mind
4171247 this is not the end of my coaching career i simply need some time to re evaluate my goals and to recharge my batteries
4171248 finally i would like to say thanks to all those who have supported me over the years it has been much appreciated

4171314 i never would but theres no point in going on about it because you end up sounding like heather mills i said this i meant that ill have a beer with him one day and itll all be fine
4171315 said i asked the prophet which deed is loved most by allah
4171316 the prophet narrated to me these three things and if i had asked more he would have told me more
4171317 o allahs apostle who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me
4171318 it is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents
4171319 o allahs apostle how does a man curse his parents
4171320 the man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother
4171321 while three persons were travelling they were overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain a big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it they said to each other think of such good righteous deeds which you did for allahs sake only and invoke allah by giving reference to those deeds so that allah may relieve you from your difficulty one of them said o allah i had my parents who were very old and i had small children for whose sake i used to work as a shepherd when i returned to them at night and milked the sheep i used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children and one day i went far away in search of a grazing place for my sheep and didnt return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept i milked my livestock as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads and i disliked to wake them up from their sleep and i also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying from hunger at my feet so this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned o allah if you considered that i had done that only for seeking your pleasure then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky so allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky then the second person said o allah i had a she cousin whom i loved as much as a passionate man love a woman i tried to seduce her but she refused till i paid her one hundred dinars so i worked hard till i collected one hundred dinars and went to her with that but when i sat in between her legs to have sexual intercourse with her she said o allahs slave be afraid of allah do not deflower me except legally by marriage contract so i left her o allah if you considered that i had done that only for seeking your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a wider opening so allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them and the last third person said o allah i employed a labourer for wages equal to a faraq a certain measure of rice and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages but when i presented his due to him he gave it up and refused to take it then i kept on sowing that rice for him several times till managed to buy with the price of the yield some cows and their shepherd later on the labourer came to me an said o allahs slave be afraid o allah and do not be unjust to me an give me my due i said to him go and take those cows and their shepherd so he took them and went away so o allah if you considered that i had done that for seeking your pleasure then please remove the remaining part of the rock and so allah released them from their difficulty
4171322 allah has forbidden you 1 to be undutiful to your mothers 2 to withhold what you should give or 3 demand what you do not deserve and 4 to bury your daughters alive and allah has disliked that a you talk too much about others b ask too many questions in religion or c waste your property
4171323 shall i not inform you of the biggest of the great sins
4171324 to join partners in worship with allah to be undutiful to ones parents
4171325 and i warn you against giving forged statement and a false witness i warn you against giving a forged statement and a false witness
4171326 to join partners in worship with allah to kill a soul which allah has forbidden to kill and to be undutiful or unkind to ones parents
4171327 shall i inform you of the biggest of the great sins that is the forged statement or the false witness
4171328 he orders us to offer prayers to give alms to be chaste and to keep good relations with our relatives
4171329 o allahs apostle buy this and wear it on fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you
4171330 this is worn only by that person who will have no share in the hereafter
4171331 how can i wear it while you have said about it what you said
4171332 i did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear
4171333 o allahs apostle inform me of a deed which will make me enter paradise
4171334 what is the matter with him what is the matter with him
4171335 it seems that the prophet was riding his she camel
4171336 the person who severs the bond of kinship will not enter paradise
4171337 who ever is pleased that he be granted more wealth and that his lease of life be pro longed then he should keep good relations with his kith and kin
4171338 whoever loves that he be granted more wealth and that his lease of life be prolonged then he should keep good relations with his kith and kin
4171339 allah created the creations and when he finished from his creations
4171340 o allah at this place i seek refuge with you from all those who sever me i e sever the
4171341 read in the quran if you wish the statement of allah would you then if you were given the authority do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship 47 22
4171342 the word ar rahm womb derives its name from ar rahman i e
4171343 the family of abu so and so i e talib are not among my protectors
4171344 al wasil is not the one who recompenses the good done to him by his relatives but al wasil is the one who keeps good relations with those relatives who had severed the bond of kinship with him
4171345 o allahs apostle what do you think about my good deeds which i used to do during the period of ignorance before embracing islam like keeping good relations with my kith and kin manumitting of slaves and giving alms etc shall i receive the reward for that
4171346 i came to allahs apostle along with my father and i was
4171347 then i started playing with the seal of prophethood my
4171348 may you live so long that your dress gets worn out and you will mend it many times and then wear another till it gets worn out i e may allah prolong your life
4171349 that garment which she was wearing remained usable for a long period
4171350 they hasan and husain are my two sweet smelling flowers in this world
4171351 whoever is in charge of put to test by these daughters and treats them generously then they will act as a shield for him from the hell fire
4171352 i have ten children and i have never kissed anyone of them
4171353 whoever is not merciful to others will not be treated mercifully
4171354 i cannot put mercy in your heart after allah has taken it away from it
4171355 do you think that this lady can throw her son in the fire
4171356 no if she has the power not to throw it in the fire
4171357 allah is more merciful to his slaves than this lady to her son
4171358 to set up a rival unto allah though he alone created you
4171359 to kill your son lest he should share your food with you
4171360 to commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbour
4171361 o allah please be merciful to them as i am merciful to them
4171362 i and the person who looks after an orphan and provides for him will be in paradise like this
4171363 the one who looks after and works for a widow and for a poor person is like a warrior fighting for allahs cause or like a person who fasts during the day and prays all the night
4171364 the one who looks after and works for a widow and for a poor person is like a warrior fighting for allahs cause
4171365 return to your families and teach them religious knowledge and order
4171366 while a man was walking on a road he became very thirsty then
4171367 this dog is suffering from the same state of thirst as i did
4171368 o allahs apostle is there a reward for us in serving the animals
4171369 yes there is a reward for serving any animate living being
4171370 o allah bestow your mercy on me and muhammad only and do not bestow it on anybody else along with us
4171371 you see the believers as regards their being merciful among themselves and showing love among themselves and being kind resembling one body so that if any part of the body is not well then the whole body shares the sleeplessness insomnia and fever with it
4171372 if any muslim plants any plant and a human being or an animal eats of it he will be rewarded as if he had given that much in charity
4171373 he who is not merciful to others will not be treated mercifully
4171374 gabriel continued to recommend me about treating the neighbours kindly and politely so much so that i thought he would order me to make them as my heirs volumn 008 book 073 hadith number 044 narated by ibn umar allahs apostle said gabriel kept on recommending me about treating the neighbours in a kind and polite manner so much so that i thought that he would order me to make them my heirs
4171375 by allah he does not believe by allah he does not believe by allah he does not believe
4171376 that person whose neighbour does not feel safe from his evil
4171377 o muslim ladies a neighbour should not look down upon the present of her neighbour even it were the hooves of a sheep
4171378 anybody who believes in allah and the last day should not harm
4171379 anybody who believes in allah and the last day should serve his neighbour generously and anybody who believes in allah and the last day should serve his guest generously by giving him his reward
4171380 to be entertained generously for a day and a night with high quality of food and the guest has the right to be entertained for three days with ordinary food and if he stays longer what he will be provided with will be regarded as sadaqa a charitable gift and anybody who believes in allah and the last day should talk what is good or keep quite i e abstain from all kinds of dirty and evil talks
4171381 o allahs apostle i have two neighbours to whom shall i send my gifts
4171382 on every muslim there is enjoined a compulsory sadaqa alms
4171383 he should work with his hands so that he may benefit himself and give in charity
4171384 then he should help the oppressed unhappy person by word or action or both
4171385 then he should refrain from doing evil for that will be considered for him as a sadaqa charity
4171386 o people save yourselves from the hell fire even if with one half of a date fruit given in charity and if this is not available then save yourselves by saying a good pleasant friendly word
4171387 wa alaikum as samu death and the curse of allah be upon you
4171388 be calm o aisha allah loves that on should be kind and lenient in all matters
4171389 o allahs apostle havent you heard what they the jews have said
4171390 do not interrupt his urination i e let him finish
4171391 a believer to another believer is like a building whose different parts enforce each other
4171392 help and recommend him and you will receive the reward for it and allah will bring about what he will through his prophets tongue
4171393 death be on you and may allah curse you and shower his wrath upon you
4171394 be calm o aisha you should be kind and lenient and beware of harshness and fuhsh i e bad words
4171395 havent you heard what i have said to them i said the same to them and my invocation against them will be accepted while theirs against me will be rejected by allah
4171396 what an evil brother of his tribe and what an evil son of his tribe
4171397 o allahs apostle when you saw that man you said so and so about him then you showed him a kind and polite behaviour and you enjoyed his company
4171398 o aisha have you ever seen me speaking a bad and dirty language remember that the worst people in allahs sight on the day of resurrection will be those whom the people leave undisturbed to be away from their evil deeds
4171399 i found it the horse like a sea or it is the sea indeed
4171400 o allahs apostle i have brought it so that you may wear it
4171401 o allahs apostle please give it to me to wear
4171402 it was not nice on your part to ask the prophet for it while you know that he took it because he was in need of it and you also know that he the prophet never turns down anybodys request that he might be asked for
4171403 i just wanted to have its blessings as the prophet had put it on so l hoped that i might be shrouded in it
4171404 time will pass rapidly good deeds will decrease and miserliness will be thrown in the hearts of the people and the harj will increase
4171405 why did you do so or why didnt you do so
4171406 he used to keep himself busy serving his family and when it was time for the prayer he would get up for prayer
4171407 if allah loves a person he calls gabriel saying allah loves so and so o gabriel love him gabriel would love him and then gabriel would make an announcement among the residents of the heaven allah loves so and so therefore you should love him also so all the residents of the heavens would love him and then he is granted the pleasure of the people of the earth
4171408 none will have the sweetness delight of faith a till he loves a person and loves him only for allahs sake b and till it becomes dearer to him to be thrown in the fire than to revert to disbelief heathenism after allah has brought him out of it c and till allah and his apostle become dearer to him than anything else
4171409 how does anyone of you beat his wife as he beats the stallion camel and then he may embrace sleep with her
4171410 today is 10th of dhul hijja the sacred forbidden day do you know what town is this town
4171411 allah has made your blood your properties and your honour sacred to one another i e muslims like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours
4171412 abusing a muslim is fusuq i e an evil doing and killing him is kufr disbelief
4171413 if somebody accuses another of fusuq by calling him fasiq i e a wicked person or accuses him of kufr such an accusation will revert to him i e the accuser if his companion the accused is innocent
4171414 what is wrong with him may dust be on his forehead
4171415 whoever swears by a religion other than islam i e if somebody swears by saying that he is a non muslim e g a jew or a christian etc in case he is telling a lie he is really so if his oath is false and a person is not bound to fulfil a vow about a thing which he does not possess and if somebody commits suicide with anything in this world he will be tortured with that very thing on the day of resurrection and if somebody curses a believer then his sin will be as if he murdered him and whoever accuses a believer of kufr disbelief then it is as if he killed him
4171416 i know a word the saying of which will cause him to relax if he does say it
4171417 i came out to inform you about the night of al qadr but as so and so and so and so quarrelled so the news about it had been taken away and may be it was better for you so look for it in the ninth the seventh or the fifth of the last ten days of ramadan
4171418 if you take this burda of your slave and wear it along with yours you will have a nice suit costume and you may give him another garment
4171419 you still have the traits of the pre islamic period of ignorance
4171420 do i still have ignorance even now in my old age
4171421 yes they slaves or servants are your brothers and allah has put them under your command so the one under whose hand allah has put his brother should feed him of what he eats and give him dresses of what he wears and should not ask him to do a thing beyond his capacity and if at all he asks him to do a hard task he should help him therein
4171422 o allahs prophet have you forgotten or has the prayer been shortened
4171423 it is hoped that their punishment may be abated till those two pieces of the leaf get dried
4171424 the best family among the ansar is the banu an najjar
4171425 admit him what an evil brother of his people or a son of his people
4171426 o allahs apostle you had said what you had said yet you spoke to him in a very polite manner
4171427 o aisha the worst people are those whom the people desert or leave in order to save themselves from their dirty language or from their transgression
4171428 they are being punished but they are not being punished because of a major sin yet their sins are great one of them used not to save himself from being soiled with the urine and the other used to go about with calumnies namima
4171429 i hope that their punishment may be abated as long as these pieces of the leaf are not dried
4171430 whoever does not give up false statements i e telling lies and evil deeds and speaking bad words to others allah is not in need of his fasting leaving his food and drink
4171431 the worst people in the sight of allah on the day of resurrection will be the double faced people who appear to some people with one face and to other people with another face
4171432 by allah muhammad by this distribution did not intend to please allah
4171433 may allah bestow his mercy on moses for he was hurt with more than this yet he remained patient
4171434 you have destroyed or cut the back of the man
4171435 may allahs mercy be on you you have cut the neck of your friend
4171436 if it is indispensable for anyone of you to praise someone then he should say i think that he is so and so
4171437 when allahs apostle mentioned what he mentioned about the hanging
4171438 o allahs apostle my izar slackens on one side without my intention
4171439 you are not among those who out of pride drag their izars behind them
4171440 this is the same well which was shown to me in the dream the tops of its date palm trees look like the heads of the devils and its water looks like the henna infusion
4171441 allah has cured me and i hate to circulate the evil among the people
4171442 the magician lubaid bin asam was a man from bani zuraiq an ally of the jews
4171443 beware of suspicion for suspicion is the worst of false tales and do
4171444 do not hate one another and do not be jealous of one another and do not desert each other and o allahs worshipers be brothers lo it is not permissible for any muslim to desert not talk to his brother muslim for more than three days
4171445 beware of suspicion for suspicion is the worst of false tales and do not look for the others faults and do not do spying on one another and do not practice najsh and do not be jealous of one another and do not hate one another and do not desert stop talking to one another and o allahs worshipers be brothers
4171446 i do not think that so and so and so and so know anything of our religion
4171447 the prophet entered upon me one day and said o aisha i do not think that
4171448 all the sins of my followers will be forgiven except those of the mujahirin those who commit a sin openly or disclose their sins to the people an example of such disclosure is that a person commits a sin at night and though allah screens it from the public then he comes in the morning and says o so and so i did such and such evil deed yesterday though he spent his night screened by his lord none knowing about his sin and in the morning he removes allahs screen from himself
4171449 what did you hear allahs apostle saying regarding an najwa secret talk between allah and his believing worshipper on the day of judgment
4171450 one of you will come close to his lord till he will shelter him in his screen and say did you commit
4171451 shall i inform you about the people of paradise they comprise every obscure unimportant humble person and if he takes allahs oath that he will do that thing allah will fulfil his oath by doing that shall i inform you about the people of the fire they comprise every cruel violent proud and conceited person
4171452 any of the female slaves of medina could take hold of the hand of allahs apostle and take him wherever she wished
4171453 by allah if aisha does not give up this i will declare her incompetent to dispose of her wealth
4171454 i vow to allah that i will never speak to ibn az zubair
4171455 by allah i will not accept the intercession of anyone for him and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow
4171456 i beseech you by allah to let me enter upon aisha for it is unlawful for her to vow to cut the relation with me
4171457 peace and allahs mercy and blessings be upon you shall we come in
4171458 the prophet forbade what you know of deserting not speaking to your muslim brethren for it is unlawful for any muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights days
4171459 i have made a vow and the question of vow is a difficult one
4171460 do not hate one another nor be jealous of one another and do not desert one another but o allahs worshipers be brothers and it is unlawful for a muslim to desert his brother muslim and not to talk to him for more than three nights
4171461 it is not lawful for a man to desert his brother muslim for more than three nights it is unlawful for them that when they meet one of them turns his face away from the other and the other turns his face from the former and the better of the two will be the one who greets the other first
4171462 i do not remember my parents believing in any religion other than
4171463 as you o abdur rahman have married give a wedding banquet even if with one sheep
4171464 the prophet made a treaty of brotherhood between the ansar and the quraish in my home
4171465 o allahs apostle i was rifaas wife and he divorced me thrice and then i was married to abdur rahman bin azzubair who by allah has nothing with him except something like this fringe o allahs apostle
4171466 o abu bakr why dont you reprove this lady from what she is openly saying before allahs apostle
4171467 perhaps you want to go back to rifaa no it is not possible unless and until you enjoy the sexual relation with him abdur rahman and he enjoys the sexual relation with you
4171468 may allah always keep you smiling o allahs apostle let my father and mother be sacrificed for you
4171469 i am astonished at these women who were with me as soon as they heard your voice they hastened to screen themselves
4171470 you have more right that they should be afraid of you o allahs apostle
4171471 o enemies of your souls you are afraid of me and not of allahs apostle
4171472 yes for you are sterner and harsher than allahs apostle
4171473 o ibn al khattab by him in whose hands my life is whenever satan sees you taking a way he follows a way other than yours
4171474 i have been ruined for i have had sexual relation
4171475 where is the questioner go and give this in charity
4171476 shall i give this in charity to a poorer person than l by allah there is no family in between these two mountains of medina who are poorer than we
4171477 o muhammad order for me some of allahs property which you have
4171478 o allahs apostle verily allah is not shy of telling you the truth is it essential for a woman to take a bath after she had a wet dream nocturnal sexual discharge
4171479 there is lack of rain so please invoke your lord to bless us with the rain
4171480 we are drowned please invoke your lord to withhold it rain from us
4171481 o allah please let it rain round about us and not upon us
4171482 truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to paradise and a man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes a truthful person falsehood leads to al fajur i e wickedness evil doing and al fajur wickedness leads to the hell fire and a man may keep on telling lies till he is written before allah a liar
4171483 the signs of a hypocrite are three whenever he speaks he tells
4171484 i saw in a dream two men came to me
4171485 they said the person the one whose cheek you saw being torn away from the
4171486 the best talk is allahs book quran and the best guidance is the guidance of muhammad
4171487 by allah in this division the pleasure of allah has not been intended
4171488 moses was harmed with more than this yet he remained patient
4171489 what is wrong with such people as refrain from doing a thing that i do by allah i know allah better than they and i am more afraid of him than they
4171490 if a man says to his brother o kafir disbeliever then surely one of them is such i e a kifir
4171491 whoever swears by a religion other than islam i e if he swears by saying that he is a non muslim in case he is telling a lie then he is as he says if his oath is false and whoever commits suicide with something will be punished with the same thing in the hell fire and cursing a believer is like murdering him and whoever accuses a believer of disbelief then it is as if he had killed him
4171492 o allahs apostle we are people who work with our own hands and irrigate our farms with our camels last night muadh led us in the night prayer and he recited sura al baqara so i offered my prayer separately and because of that he accused me of being a hypocrite
4171493 o muadh you are putting the people to trials recite wash shamsi wad uhaha 91 orsabbih isma rabbi 87 or the like
4171494 whoever amongst you swears saying by error in his oath by al lat and al uzza then he should say none has the right to be worshipped but allah and whoever says to his companions come let me gamble with you then he must give something in charity as an expiation for such a sin
4171495 verily allah forbids you to swear by your fathers if one has to take an oath he should swear by allah or otherwise keep quiet
4171496 such people as paint these pictures will receive the severest punishment on the day of resurrection
4171497 o people there are some among you who make others dislike good deeds cause the others to have aversion to congregational prayers beware whoever among you leads the people in prayer should not prolong it because among them there are the sick the old and the needy
4171498 whenever anyone of you is in prayer he should not spit in front of him in prayer because allah is in front of him
4171499 you should announce it publicly for one year and then remember and recognize the tying material of its container and then you can spend it if its owner came to you then you should pay him its equivalent
4171500 take it because it is for you for your brother or for the wolf
4171501 you have nothing to do with it the camel for it has its food and its water container with it till it meets its owner
4171502 you are still insisting on your deed i e tarawih prayer in the mosque that i thought that this prayer tarawih might become obligatory on you so you people offer this prayer at your homes for the best prayer of a person is the one which he offers at home except the compulsory congregational prayer
4171503 the strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger
4171504 so they said to that furious man dont you hear what the prophet is saying
4171505 the prophet said haya does not bring anything except good
4171506 i am narrating to you the saying of allahs apostle and you are speaking about your paper wisdom book
4171507 you are very shy and i am afraid that might harm you
4171508 the example of a believer is like a green tree the leaves of which do not fall
4171509 it is such and such tree it is such and such tree
4171510 i told that to umar who said had you said it i would have preferred it to such and such a thing
4171511 a woman came to the prophet offering herself to him in
4171512 she is better than you for she presented herself to allahs apostle for marriage
4171513 facilitate things for the people treat the people in the most agreeable way and do not make things difficult for them and give them glad tidings and let them not have aversion i e to make the people hate good deeds and you should both work in cooperation and mutual understanding obey each other
4171514 o allahs apostle we are in a land in which a drink named al bit is prepared from honey and another drink named al mizr is prepared from barley
4171515 make things easy for the people and do not make it difficult for them and make them calm with glad tidings and do not repulse them
4171516 look at this old man he left his prayer because of a horse
4171517 since the time i left allahs apostle nobody has admonished me my house is very far from this place and if i had carried on praying and left my horse i could not have reached my house till night
4171518 you have been sent to make things easy for the people and you have not been sent to make things difficult for them
4171519 let him come in what an evil man of the tribe he is or what an evil brother of the tribe he is
4171520 o allahs apostle you have said what you have said then you spoke to him in a
4171521 the worse people in the sight of allah are those whom the people leave undisturbed to save themselves from their dirty language
4171522 a believer is not stung twice by something out of one and the same hole
4171523 have i not been informed that you offer prayer all the night and fast the whole day
4171524 do not do so offer prayer at night and also sleep fast for a few days and give up fasting for a few days because your body has a right on you and your eye has a right on you and your guest has a right on you and your wife has a right on you i hope that you will have a long life and it is sufficient for you to fast for three days a month as the reward of a good deed is multiplied ten times that means as if you fasted the whole year
4171525 one half of a year i e he used to fast on alternate days
4171526 who believes in allah and the last day should talk what is good or keep quiet
4171527 whoever believes in allah and the last day should not hurt his neighbour and whoever believes in allah and the last day should serve his guest generously and whoever believes in allah and the last day should talk what is good or keep quiet
4171528 o allahs apostle you send us out and it happens that we have to stay with such people as do not entertain us what do you think about it
4171529 if you stay with some people and they entertain you as they should for a guest accept is but if they do not do then you should take from them the right of the guest which they ought to give
4171530 whoever believes in allah and the last day should serve his guest generously and whoever believes in allah and the last day should unite the bond of kinship i e keep good relation with his kith and kin and whoever believes in allah and the last day should talk what is good or keep quit
4171531 your brother abu ad darda is not interested in the luxuries of this world
4171532 where is the owner of the house i e abu bakr
4171533 we will not eat till the owner of the house comes
4171534 o ignorant boy i beseech you by allah if you hear my voice then come out
4171535 please ask your guests and do not be angry with me
4171536 he has told the truth he brought the meal to us
4171537 as you have been waiting for me by allah i will not eat of it tonight
4171538 by allah we will not eat of it till you eat of it
4171539 in the name of allah the first state of fury was because of satan
4171540 have you been detained from your guest or guests tonight
4171541 we presented the meal to him or to them but he or they refused to eat
4171542 o pleasure of my eyes the meal is now more than it had been before we started eating
4171543 will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man
4171544 o allahs apostle the murder was a thing we did not witness
4171545 then the jews will release you from the oath if fifty of them the jews should take an oath to contradict your claim
4171546 o allahs apostle they are disbelievers and they will take a false oath
4171547 inform me of a tree which resembles a muslim giving its fruits at every season by the permission of its lord and the leaves of which do not fall
4171548 o father it came to my mind that it was the date palm tree
4171549 nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor abu bakr spoke so i disliked to speak in your presence
4171550 you are not more than a toe which has been bathed in blood in allahs cause
4171551 the most true words said by a poet were the words of labid he
4171552 o allah without you we would not have been guided on the right path neither would we have
4171553 what are those fires for what are you making fires
4171554 let my parents be sacrificed for you the people claim that all the deeds of amir have been annulled
4171555 so and so and so and so and usaid bin al hudair
4171556 may allah be merciful to you o anjasha drive the camels slowly as they are carrying glass vessels
4171557 the prophet said a sentence i e the above metaphor which had anyone of you said it you would have admonished him for it
4171558 i will take you out of them as a hair is taken out of dough
4171559 i called hassan with bad names in front of aisha
4171560 dont call him with bad names because he used to defend allahs apostle against the pagans
4171561 a muslim brother of yours who does not say dirty words
4171562 o abu huraira i beseech you by allah to tell me did you hear allahs apostle saying o hassan reply on behalf of allahs apostle o allah support him hassan with the holy spirit gabriel
4171563 lampoon them the pagans in verse and gabriel is with you
4171564 it is better for a man to fill the inside of his body with pus than to fill it with poetry
4171565 it is better for anyone of you that the inside of his body be filled with pus which may consume his body than it be filled with poetry
4171566 by allah i will not admit him unless i take permission of allahs apostle for it was not the brother of who had suckled me but it was the wife of who had suckled me
4171567 o allahs apostle the man has not nursed me but his wife has nursed me
4171568 admit him because he is your uncle not from blood relation but because you have been nursed by his wife taribat yaminuki
4171569 because of this reason aisha used to say foster suckling relations render all those things marriages etc illegal which are illegal because of the corresponding blood relations
4171570 did you perform the tawaf al ifada on the day of sacrifice 10th of dhul hijja
4171571 o allahs apostle my maternal brother assumes or claims that he will murder some man whom i have given shelter i e so and so bin hubaira
4171572 o um hani we shelter him whom you have sheltered
4171573 waihaka may allah be merciful to you o anjasha drive slowly the camels with the glass vessels women
4171574 wailaka woe on you you have cut the neck of your brother
4171575 i think that such and such person is so and so and allah is the
4171576 woe to you who else would act justly if i did not act justly
4171577 no for he has companions who are apparently so pious that if anyone of you compares his prayer with their prayer he will consider his prayer inferior to theirs and similarly his fasting inferior to theirs but they will desert islam go out of religion as an arrow goes through the victims body games etc in which case if its nasl is examined nothing will be seen thereon and if its nady is examined nothing will be seen thereon and if its qudhadh is examined nothing will be seen thereon for the arrow has gone out too fast even for the excretions and blood to smear over it such people will come out at the time of difference among the muslim people and the sign by which they will be recognized will be a man whose one of the two hands will look like the breast of a woman or a lump of flesh moving loosely
4171578 i testify that i heard that from the prophet and also testify that i was with ali when ali fought against those people the man described by the prophet was searched for among the killed and was found and he was exactly as the prophet had described him
4171579 i have done sexual intercourse with my wife while fasting in ramadan
4171580 i have nothing to feed sixty persons later a basket full of dates were
4171581 o allahs apostle shall i give it to people other than my family by him in whose hand my life is there is nobody poorer than me in the whole city of medina
4171582 waihaka may allah be merciful to you the question of emigration is a difficult one have you got some camels
4171583 go on doing like this from beyond the seas for allah will not let your deeds go in vain
4171584 do not become disbelievers after me by cutting the necks of one another
4171585 wailaka woe to you what have you prepared for it
4171586 i have not prepared anything for it except that i love allah and h is apostle
4171587 if this slave should live long he will not reach the geriatric old age but the hour will be established
4171588 o allahs apostle what do you say about a man who loves some people but cannot catch up with their good deeds
4171589 a man may love some people but he cannot catch up with their good deeds
4171590 i havent prepared for it much of prayers or fast or alms but i love allah and his apostle
4171591 i have hidden something for you in my mind what is it
4171592 ikhsa you should be ashamed for you can not cross your limits
4171593 o allahs apostle allow me to chop off h is neck
4171594 should this person be him i e ad dajjal then you cannot over power him and should he be someone else then it will be no use your killing him
4171595 o saf the nickname of ibn saiyad here is muhammad
4171596 if his mother had kept quiet then i would have learnt more about him
4171597 i warn you against him and there has been no prophet but warned his followers against him noah warned his followers against him but i am telling you about him something which no prophet has told his people of and that is know that he is blind in one eye where as allah is not so
4171598 welcome o the delegation who have come neither you will have disgrace nor you will regret
4171599 o allahs apostle we are a group from the tribe of and between you and us there is the tribe of mudar and we cannot come to you except in the sacred months so please order us to do something good religious deeds so that we may enter paradise by doing that and also that we may order our people who are behind us whom we have left behind at home to follow it
4171600 for every betrayer perfidious person a flag will be raised on the day
4171601 a flag will be fixed on the day of resurrection for every betrayer and it will be announced publicly in front of everybody this is the betrayal perfidy so and so the son of so and so
4171602 none of you should say khabuthat nafsi but he is recommended to say laqisat nafsi
4171603 dont call the grapes al karm and dont say khaibat ad dahri for allah is the dahr
4171604 they say al karm the generous and in fact al karm is the heart of a believer
4171605 throw arrows let my father and mother be sacrificed for you
4171606 o allahs apostle let allah sacrifice me for you have you received any injury
4171607 ayibun abidun taibun lirabbina hamidun we are coming back to medina with repentance worshipping our lord and celebrating his our lords praises
4171608 we will not call you abu l qasim nor will we respect you for that
4171609 name yourselves by my name but do not call yourselves by my kuniya
4171610 we will not call you abul l qasim nor will we please you by calling you so
4171611 i will not change the name with which my father has named me
4171612 by that she is giving herself the prestige of piety
4171613 i will not change my name with which my father named me
4171614 yes but he died in his early childhood had there been a prophet after muhammad then his son would have lived but there is no prophet after him
4171615 name yourselves after me by my name but do not call yourselves by my kuniya 1 for i am al qasim distributor and i distribute among you allahs blessings
4171616 name yourselves after me by my name but do not call yourselves
4171617 o aisha this is gabriel sending his greetings to you
4171618 o anjash drive slowly the camels with the glass vessels i e ladies
4171619 the most awful name in allahs sight on the day of resurrection will be that of a man calling himself malik al amlak the king of kings
4171620 the most awful meanest name in allahs sight is that of a man calling himself king of kings
4171621 somebody else i e other than abu az zinad a sub narrator says what is meant by the king of kings is shahan shah
4171622 o man there is nothing better than what you say if it is the truth so do not trouble us with it in our gatherings but if somebody comes to you you can preach to him
4171623 yes o allahs apostle call on us in our gathering for we love that
4171624 o allahs apostle let my father be sacrificed for you excuse and forgive him for by him who revealed to you the book allah sent the truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him abdullah bin ubai as their ruler so when allah had prevented that with the truth he had given you he was choked by that and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed
4171625 o allahs apostle did you benefit abu talib with anything as he used to protect and take care of you and used to become angry for you
4171626 yes he is in a shallow place of fire but for me he would have been in the lowest part of the fire
4171627 take care drive slowly with the glass vessels o anjasha waihaka may allah be merciful to you
4171628 o anjasha drive slowly the camels with the glass vessels
4171629 by the glass vessels he meant the women riding the camels
4171630 drive slowly o anjasha do not break the glass vessels
4171631 we could not see anything and we found that horse like a sea fast in speed
4171632 that word which comes to be true is what a jinx snatches away by stealing and then pours it in the ear of his fore teller with a sound similar to the cackle of a hen and then they add to it one hundred lies
4171633 then there was a pause in the revelation of the divine inspiration to me then while i was walking all of a sudden i heard a voice from the sky and i raised my sight towards the sky and saw the same angel who had visited me in the cave of hira sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth
4171634 i went and behold it was abu bakr so i opened the gate for him and
4171635 open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering paradise
4171636 open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering paradise with a calamity which will befall him or which will take place
4171637 there is none amongst you but has been assigned a place either in paradise and or in the hell fire

4171640 subhan allah o allahs apostle how dare we suspect you
4171641 satan runs in the body of adams son i e man as his blood circulates in it and i was afraid that he satan might insert an evil thought in your hearts
4171642 it neither hunts a game nor kills or hurts an enemy but it gouges out an eye or breaks a tooth
4171643 that one praised allah at the time of sneezing while the other did not praise allah
4171644 allah likes sneezing and dislikes yawning so if someone sneezes and then praises allah then it is obligatory on every muslim who heard him to say may allah be merciful to you yar hamuka l lah but as regards yawning it is from satan so one must try ones best to stop it if one says ha when yawning satan will laugh at him
4171645 if anyone of you sneezes he should say al hamdulillah praise be to allah and his muslim brother or companion should say to him yar hamuka l lah may allah bestow his mercy on you when the latter says yar hamuka llah
4171646 o allahs apostle you said tashmit to that fellow but you did not say
4171647 allah loves sneezing but dislikes yawning so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises allah every muslim who hears him praising allah has to say tashmit to him but as regards yawning it is from satan so if one of you yawns he should try his best to stop it for when anyone of you yawns satan laughs at him

4171655 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step toward ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliance and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4171656 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our produces and services
4171657 airlines everywhere are struggling with the current price of oil but the solution to their problems should not lie in an anti competitive agreement which will inevitably lead to less competition and higher fares
4171658 every regulator that examined the alliance raised serious concerns about the anti competitive nature of the proposal

4171684 it seems likely to me that an augmented reality world that really takes off will out of necessity be one that offers freedom of use closer to that of the internet than of the iphone top down control technologies will certainly make a play for the space but simply wont be the kind of global catalyst for innovation that an open augmented reality web would be an ar world dominated by closed controlled systems will be safe but have a limited impact

4171735 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
4171736 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
4171737 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
4171738 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
4171739 the online thing has been really big for us the youtube videos the myspace all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
4171740 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
4171741 we just kept on hanging on cause we love the jonas brothers so much well do anything for them

4171745 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4171746 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4171747 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4171748 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4171749 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4171750 a core focus but not 80 percent of the book
4171751 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centerpiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4171752 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4171753 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to

4171771 the fear of reprisal is enough to keep anyone from denouncing police corruption even police chiefs are afraid to act for fear that they will be killed

4171777 and they have no hesitancy to attack the agents on the line with anything from assault rifles and improvised molotov cocktails to rocks concrete slabs and bottles
4171778 there are so many agent rockings that few are even reported anymore if we wrote them all up thats all we would be doing
4171779 we call things racism just to get attention we reduce complicated problems to racism not because it is racism but because it works

4171841 it doesnt make sense to try and port the old version when the wii gives you an opportunity to make something that works very differently the key difference is in how you play it you point and the minions go and break and kill things its a very literal connection for the player

4171867 a prenup requiring long term care insurance makes sense for any couple concerned about protecting their assets careers or ways of life
4171868 the bride should be especially concerned since women live longer than men and tend to inherit the care giving chores
4171869 i love the guy but im not signing up to be his nurse or purse
4171870 like millions of other women over 40 sarah knows first hand what caring entails
4171871 she spent countless hours caring for her now deceased stepmother and father and for a friend who died of cancer and now wants a life of her own
4171872 with her husband to be covered by long term care insurance sarahs assets will be protected
4171873 her time and lifestyle will also be protected also she has children and grandchildren whose inheritance will be protected should the need for care materialize she can spend quality time with her husband letting others perform the nursing chores and she can relax knowing that her own financial future will be secure
4171874 by getting married instead of staying single he can get a discount on his long term care policy
4171875 and of course he can also enjoy the benefits sarah enjoys with her policy protection of his own assets and peace of mind knowing he will not burden his children with future care expenses or chores
4171876 he wont have to worry about becoming her nurse or wallet should she require care before he does
4171877 wedding bells should signal wonderful times ahead not cloudy possibilities that can be avoided
4171878 at stake are the livelihoods of men women and families who have lived and grown up with this plant

4171880 newpage might ignore the cries of the families and the community by turning its back on them but it cannot turn away from the legislature we see this as a state wide issue that is not just about working family jobs in kimberly but also the future of jobs and the economy in wisconsin rapids nekoosa and green bay every other town in wisconsin that has good paying paper making jobs
4171881 weve run out of patience with newpages misguided business plan to restructure eliminate and destroy working family jobs for the sole purpose of ceding market share to illegal china imports of coated papers its time to draw the line and fight back
4171882 if newpage wants to exit kimberly lets give competitors an opportunity to make wisconsin paper with a world class union workforce
4171883 we can no longer accept these corporate backroom decisions that give away our livelihoods when we are capable of making a quality product that has customers and demand
4171884 we feel that this game is the ea sports freestyle answer to a great wii party game it explores the lighter side of sports and pulls inspiration from the entertainment spectacles that are so prevalent in pop culture today celebrity sports showdown will bring people to the party with a collection of games and celebirites that appeal to everyone
4171885 it is a greenfields site and will be thus unconstrained in terms of allowing an environmentally sustainable design plus future expansion

4171887 in questo momento chiedo che mi si permetta di morire per liberarmi dalle mie sofferenze so che in francia non c una legge che permette alle quipe mediche di praticare leutanasia questo mimpedisce di vivere in pace bisogna che la legge cambi il problema che lei signor nicolas sarkozy non vuole sentirne parlare io r my salvat le chiedo di metter da parte le sue opinioni personali e di smettere di essere sordo lei pu farlo se il presidente di tutti i francesi

4171891 athletes and businesses have one thing in common we cannot win every single game

4171896 both the central and state governments have followed a silo approach to e government some implementation has taken place but it has tended to be piecemeal and disjointed thereby having little impact
4171897 the biggest challenge before e government is not technology but change management
4171898 we had this game circled for a long time once we found out what the groups were
4171899 it really felt like we needed this game we needed this game just to prove to ourselves that we do mean business and that were ready to try winning this gold medal
4171900 i dont think any team in any sport is unbeatable
4171901 our defense at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter was what turned the game around for us
4171902 that was the difference tonight us not giving up on defensive plays getting back in transition playing pick and roll defense
4171903 maybe two years ago they would have got a layup or a shot on that
4171904 they just dominate us in athleticism they are incredible they are the best athletes of the world
4171905 well put this game behind us and carry this momentum over to spain on saturday
4171906 we are not changing our style because we play against the u s a
4171907 the only difference is that we dont have the pressure we can be smarter than them and beat them
4171908 im doing everything possible to get back to beijing i really want to play there
4171909 we are a young side and the crowd got to us in the first set but then we managed to get used to it
4171910 is about ready to come back to practice so i imagine peyton will be two weeks behind him
4171911 my main goal is to win rookie of the year
4171912 i want to come in and do the same thing adrian peterson came in and did last year i think that is possible
4171913 we had this game circled for a long time once we found out what the groups were
4171914 it really felt like we needed this game we needed this game just to prove to ourselves that we do mean business and that were ready to try winning this gold medal
4171915 i dont think any team in any sport is unbeatable
4171916 our defense at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter was what turned the game around for us
4171917 that was the difference tonight us not giving up on defensive plays getting back in transition playing pick and roll defense
4171918 maybe two years ago they would have got a layup or a shot on that
4171919 they just dominate us in athleticism they are incredible they are the best athletes of the world
4171920 well put this game behind us and carry this momentum over to spain on saturday
4171921 we are not changing our style because we play against the u s a
4171922 the only difference is that we dont have the pressure we can be smarter than them and beat them
4171923 and if we can really let people see that and draw in the fans maybe we can change the state of the sport
4171924 people want to know that theyre watching the real thing
4171925 we have to prevent from choking the life out of the sport
4171926 but i feel that day by day there is no pressure on me
4171927 i just dont want to hear about drugs i dont want to hear about the cheaters
4171928 i just want to hear about the exciting matchups that were getting ready to see with liu xiang and robles defar isinbayeva theres too many exciting athletes competing for us to talk about its time to show the greatness of our sport
4171929 in athletics we will focus on identifying resources recruitment retention and the health of our athletes and of course graduating productive students
4171930 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4171931 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4171932 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4171933 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4171934 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4171935 i think it was the best game weve played until now
4171936 i dont think anyone should get in the way of what i want im not going to feel bad if i go out and race my heart out and end up winning
4171937 the most important thing is being able to separate the two races and just most on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me is the psychological part
4171938 he just loves to get in and race the best and that pushes michael and that pushes aaron peirsol
4171939 i think aaron and michael both know that hes a threat when hes on and i think those are going to be two very exciting races to watch
4171940 thats a swim to get me into the meet a little bit
4171941 its been a long week waiting and watching a lot of ups and downs finally im in the meet and i can relax and do my race a little bit better
4171942 i didnt have much speed the first 50 but i think i came home pretty good i just need to put myself out there a little more in the first 50 and ill be ok
4171943 ill just try to set myself up for a good final and go from there

4171946 saya harus bisa melakukan dari apa yang bisa saja buat sekarang itu terjadi jika seseorang merasa nyaman tetapi jika kamu sedang menghadapi cedera dan harus absen dalam waktu lama maka kamu harus melihatnya secara berbeda
4171947 sebagai pegawai pemerintah kami merasa optimistis target pertumbuhan ekonomi tetap tercapai tetapi memang perlu kerja keras

4171954 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4171955 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4171956 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4171957 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4171958 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4171959 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4171960 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4171961 one could spend all day every day surfing the net for vacancies
4171962 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4171963 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4171964 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4171965 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4171966 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4171967 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4171968 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4171969 it makes a big difference to how you play when your team is winning
4171970 you have that mentality that you are going to win every time you walk out
4171971 so you can go out and express yourself you can do what you want because you feel collectively as a team youre going to win
4171972 i can play whichever way i want because i know weve got good players in the back waiting to come in it gives you the freedom to express yourself
4171973 we have been successful in one day cricket over the last few years we always aim for a trophy and we back ourselves more in one day cricket than we do in five day cricket
4171974 our record shows in four day cricket we are not the best but in one day cricket we play with such pride such passion
4171975 you can see the difference in everybody the way we walk out onto the pitch thats the winning culture for you
4171976 under ronnie irani we won two trophies in successive years in 2005 and 2006 and when you get a taste of that success you want it so badly
4171977 it has helped that not many teams beat us at chelmsford its a fortress and teams come there to get beat we know teams dont fancy us
4171978 i thought playing for england was the biggest day of your career but they reckon playing for your county at the home of cricket in front of a packed ground is the biggest for some because it is something a lot of county cricketers dont see

4171980 when you develop a new test for something it usually has to go through a fairly rigorous examination does it really do what it claims to do
4171981 bruce like most people in the lab derived most of his strains from outside sources
4171982 you have less confidence in how much the fbi is really sharing and how accurate this might be
4171983 to know what challenge youre defending against is terribly important
4171984 if top fbi officials knew in 2005 that the anthrax used in the attacks came from dr ivins lab then why didnt they clear dr hatfill until aug 8 either they were unsure of the scientific evidence against dr ivins or they knew long ago that dr hatfill was not the killer
4171985 i dont want it to reside in the court of public opinion then well end up with something like the lee harvey oswald case
4171986 there will be too many people in whose minds the case is never closed
4171987 you stupid samir you are going to pay almost six dollars for a magazine instead of sending four more dollars and getting the entire year for ten dollars
4171988 we went down into a bunker everything was already burning grad rockets began coming down in great numbers it killed lots of people there was blood everywhere

4172012 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november
4172013 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4172014 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4172015 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4172068 e cantavam o c ntico de mois s servo de deus e o c ntico do cordeiro dizendo grandes e maravilhosas s o as tuas obras senhor deus todo poderoso justos e verdadeiros s o os teus caminhos rei dos s culos

4172145 the only things that can change it will be drugs and genetic engineering so i think drugs will become widely used in 100 years people will laugh at us for trying to ban their use sport is the only activity where there is drug control you can take drugs before playing music in a concert and no one questions it you can take drugs to help you do your job
4172146 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4172147 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4172148 once you actually recover information about your laptop you probably want to take this information to the police

4172158 el mensaje de mosc a todas las partes de la antigua uni n sovi tica fue una advertencia acerca de los esfuerzos por integrarse con occidente y de salirse de la tradicional esfera de influencia rusa
4172159 durante 45 a os hemos hecho grandes esfuerzos para evitar una confrontaci n militar con rusia
4172160 no veo que haya razones para cambiar ahora ese enfoque

4172171 they have both signed the agreement to use our spec instead and will not develop and alternate version
4172172 its a shame that it took the reality of an alternative spec to make this come true intel should have opened it up without this one has to question a monopolist leading a spec like this in the future
4172173 you want one i can probably find some around here
4172174 those things cost a fortune so if you swallow it youll have to um go get it and nobody wants that stop wait dont breathe either if you get that in a lung itll be more surgery for you

4172179 tsk hmm more sighing and frowning how the heck are we going to do this
4172180 okay not great but not all bad it didnt go as planned so theres more rigamorole to go through and were not done like wed hoped but were getting there so its all cool
4172181 incredibly disappointed sore overwhelmed and optimistic three hours in the chair i stopped counting at 20 needles the lab royally fucked up the prosthetics have to start all over and make new ones probably take another month yet sigh but feels like itll be great when its finally done
4172182 if theyre not going to do anything right then there are a lot of us who arent going to go
4172183 they need to be more serious about it and take care of their players if that changes i would definitely consider playing but this is very serious if im going to do my best then i expect the other people involved to do the same if not then ill just sit home and get ready for the season
4172184 that leaves about 3000 fit young dogs who are killed
4172185 i accept that the greater proportion are killed because they are too slow to race
4172186 these alarming findings clearly show that a partially open smoking area is still an unsafe environment where people are exposed to harmful levels of secondhand smoke
4172187 the situation is unacceptable and confirms that the 2007 changes to the law did not go far enough to protect patrons or workers
4172188 nsw should effectively separate smoking areas from working including eating spaces

4172191 its very exciting to get the chance to show everyone in rotterdam what formula 1 is all about
4172192 driving through the centre of the city will certainly be spectacular to watch and very exciting for me as the driver too
4172193 i expect it to be a great show and it will really build the anticipation for the street race in valencia i have never driven at this event in rotterdam before but i won the monaco grand prix a few years ago so i think i can manage
4172194 we are here against the atrocities being committed over the people of kashmir for the last three days we are also here with the demand of the people that the srinagar muzaffarabad route should be opened and i very respectfully appeal to the people that they should act patiently
4172195 there have been lot of atrocities over people of kashmir for the last two days more than 40 kashmiri youths have been killed it was a general perception in the kashmir valley that double standards have been adopted police and army were quite patient in dealing with the violent protests of jammu
4172196 right now the temper needs to be cooled down and mutual trust needs to built in it because neither in the valley nor anywhere else in the country people even expected that jammu will have so much reaction
4172197 after 20 years there has been a flood like this we have suffered a huge loss the government is doing nothing
4172198 im familiar enough with the stages having co driven on the rally a few times
4172199 hopefully well have some better luck this time out and we can win this one thats our aim to get maximum points the titles not out of reach yet
4172200 theres going to be some tough competition for the top spot as always its never easy we always have a good battle with mark gamble and niki bjerg and im sure itll be the same this time out if its wet we should be okay but ulster can be mucky and slippery so its always tricky

4172203 and on the twenty fourth of june 1948 the communists chose to blockade the western part of the city
4172204 they cut off food and supplies to more than two million germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in berlin the size of our forces was no match for the much larger soviet army and yet retreat would have allowed communism to march across europe where the last war had ended another world war could have easily begun all that stood in the way was berlin and thats when the airlift began when the largest and most unlikely rescue in history brought food and hope to the people of this city
4172205 show the marveling multitudes americans british all your allied brothers how strong you are how great you are how your young tree of new unity planted twenty five years ago bears today the golden fruit of victory

4172207 we have warned that america must be defended not by involvement in this war or by steps toward dictatorship or by pursuing a course of imperialist expansion but by preserving peace and expanding democracy on the economic political and cultural levels today we must ask whether the present policy of the administration and the program of big business are not leading us toward war and fascism in the name of resistance to war and fascism
4172208 how best as writers can we resist the drive toward war and reaction which threatens our democratic culture
4172209 this is clear support of the soviet nazi pact by davis a short time before june 22 1941 when germany attacked the soviet union and the communist party line changed from peace to war
4172210 when you the german people tore down that wall a wall that divided east and west freedom and tyranny fear and hope walls came tumbling down around the world
4172211 of say a john mccain mentor who had toed the line for hitler i can tell you that i as a conservative republican would be pretty darned disappointed and would demand some answers i would not turn it into a joke and if mccain did not absolutely convincingly repudiate it i absolutely would not vote for him
4172212 the end result is that the bad guys on the communist far left such as the likes of frank marshall davis continue to get a pass long after theyve departed this world as will those who consider them mentors these were extreme leftists who hurt liberalism who hurt some of the dearest liberal causes davis in death is protected his dirty work covered up by a press who must now protect their anointed one
4172213 the idea that reporters are trying to help obama win in november has grown by five percentage points over the past month the latest rasmussen reports telephone survey taken just before the new controversy involving the new york times erupted found that 49 of voters believe most reporters will try to help the democrat with their coverage up from 44 a month ago just 14 believe most reporters will try to help mccain win little changed from 13 a month ago just one voter in four 24 believes that most reporters will try to offer unbiased coverage
4172214 about november 1950 the communist party in hawaii was reorganized on an underground basis in the new organization party groups were to consist of not more than three members groups were identified by numbers 1 10 rather than by names as formerly
4172215 we find that there is no substance to these claims

4172219 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
4172220 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4172221 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4172222 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
4172223 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4172224 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

4172230 its nice i mean its a lot scarier than london i felt like in england i was very comfortable and sometimes thats not a very good way to be and with paris its very much taking myself out of the comfort zone ive been in paris the past few seasons doing sales but thats a completely different thing
4172231 there are certain magazines who do things and certain magazines who dont and im very aware of that and it really doesnt bother me one little bit and i dont play the game at all ive never been one of those people who tries to schmooze people to do things because its like people do things because they want to do them or because they like what i do
4172232 well its been a big change because progressively weve had more money to play with to make things and thats always a big help but its just something that happens for me i started off quite young and ive been showing for a while and i still think that i have a lot to learn and that i havent necessarily found exactly what im all about yet so the whole idea with doing things is just trying to understand what it is that i want to do

4172240 in 1984 under the government of belisario betancur serious dialogue began between the government and the farc guerrillas to develop a strategic plan to finish the war the up uni n patri tica emerged during this process this movement brought together a whole series of organisations thirsting for and advocating peace it included some guerrilla leaders who had given up arms and embraced political life in the period 1985 to 1990 alone thousands of up activists were assassinated and at any place and any time entire families were wiped out among these three presidential candidates were assassinated in less than 8 months luis carlos gal n bernardo jaramillo jaime pardo leal the result was thousands of exiles and a group of no less importance that took up arms again and rejoined the farc among these were ricardo palmera sim n trinidad an ex banker today imprisoned in the united states different plans were developed to physically eliminate the uni n patri tica operation condor the red ball plan the esmeralda plan the return plan and lastly the coup de grace plan in 2002 the up already in its death throes lost its legal status
4172241 in colombia the military spending is higher than 5 of gdp much higher than the latin american average of 1
4172242 the usa as well as increasing its military presence in colombia has established military bases in ecuador and other countries and has organised manoeuvres in conjunction with various latin american armies such as the caba as exercise 2001 and others most recently in chile
4172243 in reality this military offensive is not a symptom of the strength of the system but a reflection of its profound crisis each time they have more problems maintaining stability and their domination through normal peaceful means including the deception of bourgeois democracy and they are preparing for the possibility that they will have to return to control by military methods
4172244 so long as they can due to the fact that the experience of vietnam is still fresh in the memory of millions of us workers and youth they would use the bourgeois armies of the region with the logistical support of the usa as has happened with the colombian army in the fight against the guerrillas
4172245 the present correlation of forces in venezuela and colombia and throughout the rest of latin america means that if imperialism opts to seek confrontation between the two countries whether with the excuse of the fight against the guerrillas or with a hypothetical destabilisation of the frontier states especially t chira and zulia as a means of opening up an intervention against the venezuelan revolution this would result in the opposite of what they are trying to achieve according to some figures some 5 million people of colombian origin are living in venezuela the majority of these support the revolution in colombia as we have said in spite of all the crimes of the oligarchy the workers movement and the peasants are keeping their heads high and enormous unrest is accumulating among the masses the attempt to use the counter revolutionary colombian regime to crush the revolution would have the effect of opening the door to the revolution in colombia and in all of latin america but for this as with everything else the key point is what policy the leadership of the venezuelan revolution and the colombian left adopt

4172249 its a very seminal period an opportunity to both celebrate 20 years of content and the fact that the source was a leader in chronicling the culture of hip hop
4172250 im on a mission to restore it to the community that gave birth to it and open the door to those that currently enjoy and influence that hip hop culture
4172251 its exciting because we believe that we can do it
4172252 we shared with him what we were trying to do the vision of hip hop and where we thought it needed to go and he thought it was refreshing and clever
4172253 were just going to expand on what the source has always done well
4172254 a core focus but not 80 per cent of the book
4172255 i think that what were trying to do is evolve it as hip hop has evolved and become an international force to evolve it without losing its core essence that was the centrepiece of its earliest beginnings and greatness but it has to evolve just like hip hop has to evolve
4172256 it is a force nobody can deny the force or the power of the source but is it the same as it was five years ago no
4172257 it does not deliver with the same punch that it used to
4172258 if they are true to the dna of the publication
4172259 it left off so much of what is the key ingredients of hip hop and lifestyle now which is lifestyle fashion online new media international aspects of how people embrace content
4172260 if anything we want to restore it restore it to greatness and its no 1 spot

4172267 why do muslim women have to beg for their rights
4172268 my question is why should a woman beg for her rights when god has bestowed rights on women why cannot men give those rights gracefully to women
4172269 because of widespread illiteracy women are simply not aware of the rights that islam has provided them with
4172270 divorce for instance is a long drawn out process yet the practice of triple talaq where men can divorce their wives by pronouncing talaq at one go has ruined the lives of many women who have been left by their husbands sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons like putting extra salt in the food
4172271 for divorced women maintenance should be provided on a reasonable scale

4172283 after 20 years there has been a flood like this we have suffered a huge loss the government is doing nothing
4172284 there is no doubt about the fiscal impact on government finances and on the deficit
4172285 the government will have to resort to extra borrowing or undertake stake sales in state run companies otherwise it is very difficult to bridge the gap
4172286 in tightening monetary policy in july the reserve bank of india has flagged the wage hike as one of the factors justifying a tighter policy stance
4172287 the fiscal deficit target will be under pressure but i dont expect the outlays to have a significant impact on inflation

4172289 the club can confirm that it has received the decision from fifas dispute resolution chamber drc on the claim made against adrian mutu
4172290 chelsea is delighted with the drcs decision to award the club 13 68million in compensation
4172291 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4172292 chelsea will now be following the process laid out in the drcs decision to claim the money from mutu
4172293 im very disappointed at birmingham that they are pursuing this
4172294 we advertised for staff they applied for the job we interviewed them they gave their necessary notice in
4172295 weve not taken anyone from birmingham who didnt want to leave im just disappointed at birmingham for saying weve been poached their staff
4172296 they have reported us to the premier league the premier league have now written us to ask for explanations we can give them full written explanations and the whole case in my opinion will be dropped
4172297 so why bring it up in the first place it doesnt put birmingham in a good light we havent done one thing wrong
4172298 im pleased that weve got steve bruce that was the best bit of business that i ever did and i probably ever will do in football
4172299 i paid 3million for him and hes paid me back so many times already hes done a fantastic job hes got his team together hes happy with his team weve signed the players that he wanted
4172300 it can be very crowded in the valley in the main place but the hermitages are a little bit removed from that
4172301 its simple its sort of celtic the design of the houses of the hermitages their stone the open fire and the rocking chair
4172302 some people need care they come very tired or maybe grieving or heartbroken
4172303 its to provide a space where they can heal and the silence does a lot of that too
4172304 it is something very kind of traditionally irish or maybe the word celtic is often used
4172305 the celtic kind of thing of the body being very important walking barefoot and being in touch with the earth and being out in the elements

4172309 my party has already held its convention without a single taxpayer dollar in its support
4172310 it probably doesnt surprise a lot of people that sen barack obamas party is trying to pry more money out of government after all democrats have perfected the art of using a political crowbar to bust open the treasurys doors but why is sen john mccain supposed maverick and reformer going along with the raid how is he any different than any of the other people who fill washington clamoring for a bailout
4172311 unfortunately too many people spend too much time prying money from the feds
4172312 and both parties are to blame its easier to list the groups that dont get federal handouts than those that fill their pockets every year with a half trillion dollar deficit and a 9 5 trillion national debt we obviously cant afford to have all of these people breaking into the treasury all the time
4172313 but what can be more obnoxious than forcing taxpayers to underwrite other peoples political opinions as thomas jefferson told us to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions that he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical youd think someone who postures as an opponent of special interests and government pork wouldnt expect the taxpayers to subsidize his own very special interest political campaign

4172340 what is interesting is that the public sector in malaysia is moving towards foss independently from any government directive or court violating copyleft copyright infringement
4172341 as powerful as all this cool technology is its also fragile as i learned yet again today

4172357 even in that dirty ass visitors room we were able to sit and build creatively and for a second as we were coming up with ideas it felt just like we were back sitting in the lab

4172360 it seems that this is the week that we come under attack from e mail spammers there have been a number of fake e mails coming in to peoples inbox the latest false rumor is a sick one it says that liz taylor has been murdered
4172361 blockquote gt well we had 134 emails in our inbox this morning asking
4172362 i think its only natural that parents are going to act that way initially
4172363 youre talking about something that is probably the most important thing in their life indirectly theyre threatened because their kids have been threatened
4172364 let the kids know that what the teacher has written is important enough for you to read carefully
4172365 going directly to a classroom to question a teacher pulls time away from instruction goes against most school visitation policies and can cause a parent to be permanently banned from being on campus
4172366 you dont want to get in trouble so you dont exactly lie but you dont exactly tell the story as it was
4172367 the teacher said i just thought i knew nancy well enough to tease her she didnt realize that nancy was interpreting it that way
4172368 i always say i dont care what they say about me the first day of school but what they say about me at the last day of school
4172369 if the teacher thinks differently than your parental philosophy your child is learning more than you can teach her
4172370 if something doesnt feel right take it to the principal and ask that they conduct an investigation
4172371 give the school a chance to get to the bottom of the situation and find a solution
4172372 there is a real chance that safaa may die during the operation
4172373 the liver kidney intestines are all squished to the sides his lungs are very small its hard to believe he is able to breathe
4172374 sometimes when we see other children play he starts to cry
4172375 i dont buy him certain toys like soccer balls because he looks at me and when he throws it far away he cant go and get it even at his age he understands
4172376 i used everything i have to rescue my baby i tried to do something but i cant
4172377 i found out that all the money in the world couldnt save him but i did realize that money could save lives
4172378 the mission is to bring people to hospitals who have life threatening problems and dont have money i dont care where they come from
4172379 the center is almost the only beacon of hope for patients seeking treatment for cancer
4172380 we said we cannot turn a blind eye to these patients they are pleading please help so we cannot just ignore that we dont have the millions to cover so many iraqi patients so we said lets try something else
4172381 in many cases children come with diseases who have just advanced to a level that you cant give any curable treatment
4172382 if you saw the patients months earlier six eight 10 months earlier you can do many other things that now just arent doable
4172383 we tried to get her into a hospital in iraq and the doctor kicked us out
4172384 there was shooting and firing outside we fought with the doctor we fought to get her in i lost all hope
4172385 i was watching my daughter die in front of me slowly and there was nothing i could do
4172386 we dont know what will happen when we open safaas abdomen and we take this tumor out
4172387 safaa has a chance of survival definitely if he survives today so today is the most critical day in safaas life
4172388 this is such a happy occasion you brought happiness into the hearts of parents
4172389 i will tell you the truth tears come to your eyes youre saving a life
4172390 when you look at somebody that had a life threatening problem and you could with money save that life youve got to sit back and say you helped make this world just a little better and thats what its all about
4172391 when demand for homes drops ordinary sellers will take their homes off the market let them sit or reduce their prices in small increments but banks will slash prices to where the homes will sell quickly
4172392 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4172393 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4172394 loan officers are reporting that they are still tightening underwriting standards
4172395 we expect that sales volume which has leveled off some will drop another 10 over the next few months over this credit squeeze
4172396 we believe our ima hybrid system is best suited for smaller vehicles where the fuel efficiency gains are the greatest
4172397 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it and that is our goal for this new hybrid model to make it affordable for a new generation of car buyers
4172398 i dont think a lot of people know that i do write my own music because they have only seen me perform as elvis
4172399 i want people to see me as an artist and actor who can portray anyone at any given moment
4172400 i think people especially my fans have a right to know what i or any artist they have come to love have overcome sacrificed and gone through in life to get to where we are today
4172401 i dont think people realize that we are just as human as they are but the world we struggle to succeed and survive in has such a different outlook of reality
4172402 its more of a love letter to my fans from me

4172412 it provides the superior image quality of optical rear projection with front screens minimal space requirements and ease of installation
4172413 rgpc has always shied away from movs in the past because they are by nature designed to be sacrificial and have a reputation for breaking down and letting surges and other electrical noise flow unchecked through to the connected gear
4172414 but our research and testing has convinced us that the new breed of movs are built to last richard would not allow us to put his name on this product otherwise
4172415 wall street and financial services firms are more and more looking at saas from the crm side of the fence
4172416 in the risk and compliance space weve seen an uptick in vendors offering hosted applications and in financial services firms willing to use such services
4172417 theres a fit for saas because its modular its repetitive and it takes significant intellectual capital to build yet it is not something companies want to waste a lot of money on
4172418 the deployment of client software itself forgetting everything else is very traumatic on top of that these firms have a difficult time developing these massive programs so going to saas providers is efficacious
4172419 with the t2 b universal controller and the zrp 6 remote control processor we are extremely pleased to introduce the next generation of two already highly successful products the t2 and the rp 6
4172420 the latest versions of what were already highly refined and well accepted products are indicative of rtis unwavering commitment to continual improvement and innovation
4172421 the combination of the iremote ts ht msu and intellicontrol ics make a powerful addition to the integrators tool kit

4172439 we did an extensive search to find the right package
4172440 ccl container was the only company that met our requirements in terms of package aesthetics and recyclability and they worked with us very closely to overcome the many challenges associated with a new product launch
4172441 aluminum has the highest recycling rate of any beverage packaging material
4172442 we set out to make m13 the functional beverage brand of choice for discerning consumers and our aluminum bottles have helped us achieve that positioning we like the look and feel of matte finish aluminum and it has given our brand a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace
4172443 we kept pushing the envelope in order to produce the most distinctive package possible ccls technical team never lost patience they came up with creative solutions to meet our particular package requirements at every turn
4172444 we feel our packaging is and will continue to be an integral part of m13s success
4172445 feedback so far has been extremely favorable people tell us they like the clean utilitarian look and the matte finish weve even been invited to enter the bottle in a global packaging design competition
4172446 with many people injured and many more fleeing their homes as a result of the conflict medical and relief supplies are urgently needed

4172488 there was little ice at the north pole a chinese naval squadron sailed right round the arctic in 1421 and found none
4172489 it will be remembered as a remarkable lesson in how fanaticism can temporarily blind a large part of the scientific community and allow unproven results to become mainstream thought overnight the embarrassment that it caused to many scientists working in the field of climatology will not be soon forgotten hopefully new findings to come as remarkable and enticing as they may first appear will be greeted with a bit more caution and thorough investigation before they are widely accepted as representing the scientific consensus
4172490 tremendous variation over the past 6 000 years with climate variability the rule not the exception there are many periods much warmer than today and of course periods much cooler as well comparisons between temperature variations and solar activities indicate that both temperature trends on centennial millennial timescales and climatic events are related to solar variability suggesting that solar variability is possibly a primary driving force that influences temperatures
4172491 people are lying to you they cant lie to me
4172492 but the warming is happening for damnsure and the co2 is going up for damnsure and the results of those things are tracking pretty accurately with the models
4172493 stories about the chinese navy dont help your cause a lot doesnt it bother you at all that many of the people championing this idea of yours are complete nutcases
4172494 temperature response in the climate lags co2 by more than 30 years we expect to be seeing it starting strongly maybe 10 years ago no more and oh looky when did we get the record high temperatures
4172495 an awful lot of records set in the last decade hmmmm
4172496 ad hoc panel consisting of three statisticians the chair of the committe was joe barton republican texas an oilman and known climate change sceptic
4172497 is unprecedented for the last 400 years and potentially the last several millennia
4172498 human activities are responsible for much of the recent warming
4172499 there is nothing in this report that should raise any doubts about the broad scientific consensus on global climate change or any doubts about whether any paper on the temperature records was legitimate scientific work said boehlert november 14th 2006 at 1 09 am
4172500 so lets just stop gabbing on about it its completely pointless and its getting us nowhere
4172501 reg for gods sake its perfectly simple all youve got to do is to go out of that door now and try to stop the romans nailing him up its happening reg somethings actually happening reg cant you understand
4172502 1 the hockeystick has been independently verified by other researchers
4172503 3 it is m amp ms papers that find it hard to pass peer review and get published in science journals not manns
4172504 by the way do you agree with monkton that it is wrong to treat earth as if it is not a black body
4172505 never during the past 10 000 years has the sun been as active in ejecting magnetised plasma as during the past few decades
4172506 may recently have passed its maximum and that it may decrease in coming decades
4172507 richard lindzen says hes willing to take bets that global average temperatures in 20 years will in fact be lower than they are now
4172508 when the data is properly handled the hockeystick is simply there with a pretty damned fuzzy handle what part of this do you fail to understand
4172509 as far as whatever wegmans performing statisticians came up with their relevance is perfectly zero they were asked very specific questions in order to get very specific answers we are talking about professional politicians they only ask questions for which they know the answers
4172510 the problem with the mwp is that it wasnt necessarily and isnt clearly global
4172511 the co2 goes up the temperature goes up just about the amount predictable using the actual instruments and information available to us
4172512 you are clearly not qualified to question the rest of the climate science
4172513 the co2 goes up the temperature goes up you are neglecting the rather crucial fact that the amount of co2 we a talking about is utterly trivial in the overall greenhouse effect and could not possibly account for a significant amount of the recent warming since the lia
4172514 since bristlecone pines respond significantly to co2 levels they are not good proxies
4172515 it has the handle thats shaped the way you think it is
4172516 the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate
4172517 im genuinely surprised at the level of fundamentalism there is no debate there is no argument
4172518 from what ive been reading over the past year the jury still appears to be out but the
4172519 in general we found mbh98 and mbh99 to be somewhat obscure and incomplete and the criticisms of mm03 05a 05b to be valid and compelling
4172520 the error may be easily overlooked by someone not trained in statistical methodology we note that there is no evidence that dr mann or any of the other authors in paleoclimatology studies have had significant interactions with mainstream statisticians
4172521 if corrected brings their data in agreement with manns assessment of the error which is not important in the final result as shown in the wegman analysis presented
4172522 we have been able to reproduce the results of mcintyre and mckitrick 2005b
4172523 the 1990 report was not predicated on a global warming scenario it is clear that at least in 1990 the medieval warm period was thought to have temperatures considerably warmer than the present era
4172524 vathena arc nasa gov is an educational aid for teachers updated last in 1997 and the chart you refer to has no scale whatsoever not real useful
4172525 but telling me that you dont understand how wrong monckton was about black body radiation is a whole nother level of not knowing
4172526 the researchers i worked with were measuring the ice back in 1996 and getting scared
4172527 your problem is that you are overfocused on this one detail and not on the whole question or the bulk of evidence i told you many many posts ago that i didnt really give a rats patootie about the hockey stick
4172528 we got an e mail at about 3pm saying weve passed the trot up were in

4172533 yesterdays newsday column was absolutely despicable and they should be ashamed and embarrassed for having printed it
4172534 jenna wretched words were nothing more than an in print character assassination of rush limbaugh sean hannity and bill oreilly a foray into absurd leftist delusions of links between them and the vile murderer in a tennessee church this past july 27
4172535 this is not a freedom of speech issue this is newsday giving this woman a license to assault these fine men in print accusing them of complicity in murder
4172536 newsday should immediately publish a full retraction and an abject and absolute apology to those defamed by this womans wretched words and ms rugile should never again appear in their pages
4172537 were louis vuitton we dont have pissers in fact we are all mannequins and thus do not ever need to use the bathroom at all
4172538 i like to think that the bulwer lytton fiction contest contributes to the universal improvement of mankind and that the university should respond by giving me large annual merit pay increases i also think that my wife should always do what i tell her and that my cat should stop shedding on my clothes i expect all three to happen about the same time
4172539 california public school students are continuing to make solid steady progress learning the skills and concepts necessary for success in school and in life
4172540 while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4172541 we cannot lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4172542 it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively compete with their peers

4172558 y como ellos no aprobaron tener en cuenta a dios dios los entreg a una mente reprobada para hacer cosas que no convienen estando atestados de toda injusticia fornicaci n perversidad avaricia maldad llenos de envidia homicidios contiendas enga os y malignidades murmuradores detractores aborrecedores de dios injuriosos soberbios altivos inventores de males desobedientes a los padres necios desleales sin afecto natural implacables sin misericordia quienes habiendo entendido el juicio de dios que los que practican tales cosas son dignos de muerte no s lo las hacen sino que tambi n se complacen con los que las practican
4172559 o ignor is que vuestro cuerpo es templo del esp ritu santo el cual est en vosotros el cual ten is de dios y que no sois vuestros

4172561 no te inclinar s a ellas ni las honrar s porque yo soy jehov tu dios fuerte celoso que visito la maldad de los padres sobre los hijos hasta la tercera y cuarta generaci n de los que me aborrecen

4172570 majority of people who are targeted by marketing models are not very dumb
4172571 why the hell are you so dirty get away from my car
4172572 i dont know if you can get this bud its a bit heavy
4172573 right there on the side of car if you can read
4172574 no i hate magicians theyre nothing but cold blooded retards
4172575 dummy what no im not a ventriloquist do i look like a pedophile to you
4172576 son my profession is my hands you wouldnt want me to break this bottle and slice up all the meat in my hands would you
4172577 time is money i got time so hand over the money
4172578 at least we dont have to worry about him bringing girls home when hes older
4172579 steve theyre looking for you down at the music hall show starts in an hour
4172580 the red sox continue to struggle as they lose their 5th straight game at home
4172581 they like pod races they like gambling they like card games they go out and shoot at wamp rats in the canyons there is an entertainment industry but you wont find that out until we get to the live action show in a few years
4172582 animation is an art you either like photo realistic art and you hang that in the museum of modern art or you like something that tries to find the truth behind the realism animation is all about design style ive been making photo real movies all my life
4172583 on revenge of the sith i lamented the fact that i had to jump over the clone wars because it had nothing to do with anakin skywalker hes just another player its too bad because its like world war ii its a huge canvas there to be explored so we decided we would do a little five minute animation series for cartoon network that sort of got me into thinking we could do a regular tv show i got to fill in a blank and go around in a universe that is a little bit more lighthearted
4172584 when the first few shots came back i looked at them and said this is fantastic
4172585 i wanted to develop a character that would help anakin settle down
4172586 at the end of episode ii hes kind of a wild child and he and obi wan arent getting along so the idea was to see how they become friends how they become partners how they become a team one of the ways to do that is that when you become a teacher you have to become more responsible what i wanted to do was take anakin and force him into this thinking now i have to teach somebody now i have to be more responsible it was that juxtaposition i happen to have a couple daughters so i have a lot of experience with that particular situation
4172587 ventress was a character that was actually developed for early concept art of attack of the clones there was this idea that the sith apprentice after darth maul would be a girl that got abandoned eventually in favor of count dooku but the concept art existed the comics books and novels on the clone wars that were done before had utilized that new character when it came time to develop the series we realized that was a big fan favorite so lets draw her out
4172588 its more like indiana jones actually you have themes and things this is bigger we get to go more places the fun part about animation especially is that were allowed to go and do stories about clones we get to know them and find out what they do for recreation and find out what jabba the huts family is all about and do all kinds of things that dont have anything to do with the main character
4172589 when we started the project it was initially a television series
4172590 we needed to be able to work at a pace that was pretty rapid it was hard to get all the actors that would be off on a set you need people available every week you cant really afford multi million dollar actors to do a television series those guys make more during their coffee break
4172591 to be very honest with you i dont really think i need to hire a big movie star to publisize my movie if you like it thats fine i dont need angelina jolie here thats what it comes down to in the end they have two days in the studio and then they have like two weeks doing press they are mainly paid for the press stuff
4172592 again opportunities present themselves i wanted to do the tv series ive got about maybe 15 projects sitting here and i have to say well which one works now it makes sense for me to do these tv things so im doing some television this is one of them
4172593 its on the shelf there one of 50 projects and if i can come up with a story its very hard to come up with a story for that thing its really impossible it has to be real it has to be something that actually happens and it has to be something people know about its a really difficult research project theyre researching now and last time it took us 14 years
4172594 http www dailymail co uk news article 528694 olympics clean chinese style inside beijings shocking death camp cats html
4172595 these cats are being left to die it is very inhumane
4172596 people dont want to keep cats in beijing any more so they abandon them or send them to the compounds
4172597 when we went inside we saw about 70 cats being kept in cages stacked one on top of the other in two tiny rooms
4172598 disease spreads quickly among them and they die slowly in agony and distress the government wont even do the cats the kindness of giving them lethal injections when they become sick they just wait for them to die
4172599 it is the abandoned pets that suffer the most and die the soonest they relied so much on their owners that they cant cope with the new environment
4172600 most refuse to eat or drink and get sick more quickly than the feral cats
4172601 we do not believe any of the cats that go in there survive
4172602 we have tried to negotiate with the government to stop the round ups and to introduce cut price neutering services so that people can afford to keep their pets but they wont listen to us
4172603 they are not thinking about the cats they just want to get results in the quickest way possible by clearing as many cats from the city as they can
4172604 if i dont take them in the government will kill them
4172605 people believe what the government tells them and that is why they are abandoning more and more family pets
4172606 he didnt like dogs so he decided to have dogs killed but there was a bad reaction from the foreign media and they were pressured to stop
4172607 now they have stopped killing dogs but the new victims are cats it is all connected to the olympics
4172608 when women get pregnant the doctor will ask them if they have a cat in the house
4172609 if they reply yes they tell them you must get rid of it it will be bad for the baby
4172610 i keep all the cats in my house and 100 of them sleep in my bedroom at night i am too frightened to let them out if they go outside they will be taken away and killed
4172611 the government is not telling people the truth look at me i live with them 24 hours a day seven days a week and i am very healthy
4172612 there are no cats here go away no one is allowed inside unless you have official permission
4172613 we did it out of love for the children we were worried the cats might harm them these six cats had been hanging around the kindergarten looking for food
4172614 so three male teachers put out plates of tuna in cages for bait trapped the cats and then beat them to death with sticks
4172615 we were very worried the children might try to stroke them and that the cats might scratch them or pass on diseases we had to get rid of the cats and this was the only way to do it
4172616 we understand that with the olympic games the beijing government is eager to show the world the city in a good light
4172617 but capturing and dealing with cats in such an inhumane way will seriously tarnish the image of beijing and the games

4172622 i would not have been able to do that without working in new zealand and i have been trying to do this for years
4172623 when i come back i will go to the bank and settle the loan and start up a backpackers and do this by myself with friends in new zealand who will invest the scheme in new zealand has opened up doors going to new zealand is not only working for money and buying people who are potential investors might want to do joint ventures
4172624 we have very very few people from sanma province in the rse scheme so we would like to see more people there
4172625 we have the land but not the finance for the land and if more and more people go out that will make the difference they want to see your beautiful country get some work and bring some money to their people
4172626 for the season coming up we will have a good model and will expand it to the remote areas where we have hardworking people without experience of city life so we get some real benefits to the rural community
4172627 we are behind them 120 because i dont know where the people would have come from otherwise
4172628 without the 200 people on the scheme we would have cleaned out winz and i have no idea where we would get the others
4172629 vanuatu is very limited in its financial resources and about 80 of the population is in rural areas by exporting labour to new zealand we will help poverty in vanuatu and help people be more positive when the workers return they can start their own business and build their own homes it is already happening
4172630 in terms of traded lamb and sheepmeat australasia is the worlds largest exporter and sheep flocks are declining that means a tighter supply of lamb availability
4172631 this is promising for higher prices in the future particularly for key markets such as europe and north america
4172632 quite frankly i m going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4172633 two of the three opposition parties dont support the government and say we should be defeated mr dion says he doesn t support the government but wont say you know whether he will defeat us or not
4172634 im lucky that im alive today seriously i have a hard time not getting emotional talking about it
4172635 its been a long time coming for me and its been pretty gratifying to have made it this far
4172636 im not going to make any rash decisions im going to enjoy the rest of the olympic experience that a lot of people in the world dont get a chance to do
4172637 and im going to sit down with family and friends and talk about it
4172638 i was going to save this but i really want the world record
4172639 i dont know anybody else thatll say that will say that publicly but i really want to go for the world record
4172640 thats the best i had for today so well move on
4172641 it just didnt happen some days your body just doesnt work my body picked a bad time not to work
4172642 i think the numbers that came out today suggest that demand weakness in the u s could continue
4172643 refiners seem to anticipate demand falling a lot more than it really has
4172644 refinery utilization is now so far behind where it was a year ago that even with the dollar as a strong backdrop it was hard to get excited about supply
4172645 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the united states than ever before
4172646 were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available
4172647 i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action
4172648 fort hays state university does not condone that behavior it is wrong or the language in that video it is inappropriate and too coarse
4172649 however we understand there is this confrontational rapid delivery debate style where people are screaming at one another
4172650 i only hope that the costs are not too high my greatest concern however is that the university our students or anybody else does not suffer too greatly for my mistakes
4172651 think with his own thoughts he would not have punched the windows
4172652 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4172653 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4172654 he was going to come in cut out my heart cut off my eyelids and slash my throat
4172655 well you dont get people who pick a name out of a telephone book and decide theyre going to kill them thats just not rational thought process
4172656 i am in a pretty good workout regimen that i like so it inspired me to keep it up the energy level and the way i feel now is great
4172657 with her its not i want to look good in that dress she wanted to start moving around because she thought it would make her feel better she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
4172658 i think the best thing that ever happen to ben chairman bernanke is he served on the school board in princeton new jersey and im very serious about that what allows him to run a meeting the way he does with harmony and results i think was that training on the school board i ran for the united states senate ive negotiated with the u s congress on behalf of the president twice thats a piece of cake compared to being on a school board

4172662 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4172663 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4172664 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4172665 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4172666 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4172667 bill gwatney was our friend our partys leader and so many times our partys conscience
4172668 our state and our party are better for all that bill gwatney has done
4172669 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend
4172670 there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney

4172675 im not sure how much i believe about difficultly in getting bank financing it seems like cvs cvs didnt have a difficult time and waste management wmi has received positive feedback from banks regarding the rsg offer not to mention the fact that bks is under levered going into a potential transaction bks has 96 83mm in debt and netting out cash has 70 75mm in debt this represents 5 of the company market cap and is only 20 5 of the estimated 2009 ebitda in addition if bks were to buy bgp for 10 share financing the transaction with debt the combined entity would only have a debt ebitda of 2 55x and this is exclusive of any synergies and also uses the current analyst estimated ebitda where the analyst community for the most part doesnt include the 120mm in sg amp a cuts that bgp has announced 60mm this year and 60 mm next year so i find it hard to believe that bks investment bank wouldnt see this and would be reluctant to lend as far as the concern about the length of leases without further detail on the financials of each location according to the 10k over the next 5 years on a cumulative basis bgp domestic super stores have 2 2 4 9 9 6 11 2 14 5 of the leases expiring and more importantly the company has on a cumulative basis 52 4 76 5 88 4 95 1 and 97 3 of the walden stores coming off lease this is important b c the walden business loses money and is drag on cash flow so closing these stores would be a big benefit to a combines entity while many of the super stores overlap with bks stores i would think that a controlled closing of overlapping stores could be achieved the companies share approximately 112 investors below is a list of the top 12 bgp investors who also own a position in bks i would think that pershing square t2 brandywine and hawkshaw all have talked with both companies about the merits of a combined entity shareholders are listed followed by the of share held in borders and then barnes amp noble pershing square capital management 17 5 11 9 deutsche investment management americas inc 6 4 0 6 barclays global investors na california 4 7 2 7 vanguard group inc 3 2 3 1 t2 partners management lp 2 2 0 5 state street global advisors 2 2 2 5 citigroup global markets united states 2 0 0 3 millennium partners 1 4 0 2 brandywine global investment management llc 1 2 0 5 hawkshaw capital management llc 1 1 0 5 northern trust investments 1 1 0 5 lsv asset management 1 1 5 3 while the deal would be looked at by the government i think ultimately the companies would be allowed to combine using the argument that online retailers are serious competition also im not entirely sure what the point of the article is tough b c it goes though all the reasons why it wont happen but states that bks could changes its mind

4172685 i think what weve seen especially with leisure travel is that 3 was the magic number
4172686 locally what weve seen when it comes to leisure travel is that our members that come to see us seem to be taking shorter trips instead of going to say virginia beach theyll instead choose the new jersey shore
4172687 when gas prices around december were over 3 for a time people finally started to change their daily habits
4172688 and thats been even more evident over the last few months when weve seen 4 gas people are carpooling theyre making fewer trips and trying to consolidate errands
4172689 we were looking to save money but i also dont like to drive definitely to save money and its greener and cleaner for the environment
4172690 the cost of maintaining transportation infrastructure does not change based on how many people are using it
4172691 new york is in the northeast where we have an extensive aging transportation infrastructure particularly the highway and bridge system which is heavily punished by the severe weather we have here the costs of maintaining and repairing the infrastructure are largely fixed
4172692 all of those things are rising at the same time that our revenue is declining because people are traveling less
4172693 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
4172694 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
4172695 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
4172696 even with the prices were at now its still very high and people are still going to be looking to reduce the amount of miles driven

4172701 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4172702 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis

4172824 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4172825 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4172826 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

4172828 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4172829 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4172830 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades

4172835 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4172836 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4172837 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4172838 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4172839 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4172840 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4172848 thats where nursing staff took these babies and left them to die
4172849 christ hospital and we now know other hospitals and clinics around the country are involved in an abortion procedure called induced labor abortion
4172850 my experience was that they the babies survive as short as a few minutes to once almost as long as an eight hour shift
4172851 to be clear these were living babies who were left out to die and they were issued both birth and death certificates according to illinois state law
4172852 when she told me what she was doing i couldnt bear the thought of this suffering child dying alone
4172853 and so i cradled and rocked him for the forty five minutes that he lived
4172854 was unmoved and actually opposed the born alive infant protection act
4172855 thought that infanticide was acceptable and voted to protect it some people said that barack obama was uninformed or may not have fully understood the implications of this bill but he voted against it three times thats calculated
4172856 as chairman of the health and human services committee in 2003 he stopped the identical wording from being introduced
4172857 barack obama can play word games but at the end of the day his opposition was responsible for living babies being left out to die and that is indefensible
4172858 his claims have been a staple of old media reports from the beginning but now that stanek has revealed the truth we will have to see if the old media corrects the record or if they suddenly just go mum on the subject like they have so far
4172859 so we are forced to realize that obama knows the truth but is trying to rewrite history and with the willing accomplices in the old media he has succeeded in doing so thus far
4172860 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do
4172861 what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years

4172865 cyprus has its advantages that we are a small country and the demand can easily catch up we are not like spain where there is a need for a saturation period in the market for example
4172866 unlike elsewhere developers here do not start to build unless they sign a contract in most cases what happened in the uk was that many houses were being built while demand was still high and remain unsellable as the demand dropped we do have things going for us

4172872 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
4172873 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
4172874 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

4172926 its a shame that it took the reality of an alternative spec to make this come true intel should have opened it up without this one has to question a monopolist leading a spec like this in the future
4172927 intel and jajah have a common objective to deploy technology building blocks that deliver a richer communication experience for consumers
4172928 the combination of our technologies enables added convenience and energy efficiency for consumers who want the pc to be a genuine two way communication platform for their ip based telephony services

4172943 bank repossessions or reos continued to be the fastest growing segment of foreclosure activity in july posting a 184 percent year over year increase compared to a 53 percent year over year increase in default notices and an 11 percent year over year increase in auction notices
4172944 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale realtytrac now has more than three quarters of a million properties in its active reo database a number that represents approximately 17 percent of the inventory of existing homes for sale reported in june by the national association of realtors
4172945 la pasividad de las grandes fuerzas pol ticas nacionales y la complicidad activa del psoe y el gobierno
4172946 y ojo con lo que empieza a pasar en la comunidad valenciana no han ido m s lejos porque all ni el pp ni el psoe han necesitado los votos de los nacionalistas para gobernar

4172952 im frequently accused of being a liberal or a flack for the democratic party
4172953 we were encouraged to repatriate and were told that the afghan government would give us a house work and other facilities
4172954 we dont have a school here there is no hospital no electricity no transport no work
4172955 our children were going to school in pakistan but there is no school here
4172956 i dont think people will continue to live here because of all the problems we are facing
4172957 its not a job only for the morr various other government and non government bodies must take part in the efforts to help returnees reintegrate effectively
4172958 the dream that you are going to give a piece of land to everyone who comes back was false and should not have been shared because that dream does not exist
4172959 often returnees are allotted land 50km from urban areas in flood plains where returnees have no means of livelihood
4172960 many people are waiting to see hospitals roads schools electricity and other facilities in those areas and then move there
4172961 lets make no mistake about this a deal that does not involve opposition leader morgan tsvangirai the man who won the free and fair election in march is null and void and it seems the old man president robert mugabe is just not ready to hand over power to those that have legitimacy
4172962 we are moving in circles and that makes me sick very frustrated
4172963 there has been a disagreement with one element of the talks which has to do with an agreement with power sharing morgan tsvangirai asked for time out in order to reflect on this matter so that we reconvene them later
4172964 just like in the run off where mugabe contested alone this empty deal is in all essence a zanu pf agreement
4172965 mutambara did not run in the presidential elections and is just too happy to have some relevance in zimbabwean politics
4172966 all my hopes of returning to a normal life in the near future have been dashed by mugabes unwillingness to relinquish power
4172967 prices keep going up as our pockets shrivel there is no electricity no water and unemployment will rise even further as industries close all because of an obsession with power an obsession that benefits a few people at the expense of the majority
4172968 many in formal employment thought that an internationally accepted deal would bring back the spark to their jobs but there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel
4172969 i am convinced that mugabe is living in perpetual fear and the brave face that we see on television masks a man who is in a deep quandary
4172970 even if he mugabe wanted to give tsvangirai some executive powers there are many powerful people within his party who would lose out and these people seem to be pressuring him to deny the mdc leader what rightfully belongs to him and to the people
4172971 after parliamentary elections the opposition won more seats than zanu pf and that was good since it reversed the then ruling partys ability to make decisions based on its majority in parliament
4172972 however with the stance taken by mutambara the opposition is now divided there are some in the opposition who would grab any chance to be in positions of power and i am afraid that mugabe might announce a cabinet that includes members from tsvangirais party a development that could further weaken his party if some of those members decide to accept what is offered
4172973 since january everyone has been talking about elections and nothing has been moving we have gone for too long without a parliament
4172974 and who is tsvangirai to think that he can hold us to ransom after all he is nothing but the mouthpiece of britain and the united states and is responsible for all the suffering we are experiencing today
4172975 legitimate leader of zimbabwe because he won the 27 june run off and led the war against imperialism while he spends sleepless nights trying to find ways of totally empowering the people of this country
4172976 the political leaders acknowledge that none of them on their own with their political parties have the capacity to solve these problems and so they have to work together
4172977 tsvangirai was not happy that he would have presided over a few social and economic ministries while mugabe retained executive powers as executive president while security ministries would have fallen directly under the control of mugabe
4172978 no the talks have not collapsed they can never collapse as long as we have tongues for talking
4172979 landmark the first of its kind to be adopted in the country since the 1990s
4172980 the strategy signals a real moment of opportunity in iraq with greater stability a clear will to recover a growing un presence and better access to many areas
4172981 we will now be able to consolidate achievements and shift focus helping iraq to mobilise its substantial capacity and resources while we work to meet outstanding humanitarian needs
4172982 it brings the whole un organisation together in partnership with iraq and its people to reduce poverty foster growth and consolidate democracy in our country
4172983 iraqs situation is a disastrous one despite the soaring oil revenues
4172984 all iraqis are going through a very deteriorated humanitarian situation with poor public services such as drinking water sewage networks and electricity coupled with damage to their environment
4172985 what has been offered so far by the iraqi government and the international community is only simple help and meets no more than 2 percent of real needs in our view
4172986 we have heard about meetings inside and outside iraq resulting in tens or hundreds of agreements with millions and billions of dollars to help iraqis but we havent seen any improvement in our life

4172998 its so pleasant that so many people came forward and spoke in favor of my nomination
4172999 i hope that i did well to engage in dialogue with the senators in any of their interests i do hope that i will have their full consideration the process seems to be really moving along and im really encouraged by some of the comments

4173002 the only respect we give our veterans is when theyre gone and buried
4173003 were not asking for special treatment were asking for treatment
4173004 its the federal politicians the local politicians republicans and democrats
4173005 anything to get our veterans a little more than they have now
4173006 veterans deserve more than a clinic and a small office
4173007 what we are going to do today is we are going to go in there and hit it hard
4173008 we are going to go ahead and change the ceiling tiles we are going to paint it we are going to clean it we are going to do everything we can to get that dining facility ready
4173009 weve had two days of good weather so im just expecting that if i go back and get a status report from the contractor i know he will give us good news
4173010 i assumed that since they are brand new they would be working well we installed them and to our dismay the batteries werent working
4173011 it is worrying that a number of small firms are walking into stores and buying a consumer version of the technology
4173012 none of the chain stores offer business level solutions with features such as centralised policy management they may not be getting fit for purpose protection
4173013 when you look at the rapid growth of new threats and overlay that on the fact that two thirds have not heard of them it highlights the need for education and there is a role for the channel to play in that
4173014 the reseller channel needs to explain why small businesses should be working with them
4173015 the economic downturn in countries like the uk is one of many reasons
4173016 and with it it doesnt really matter where you are the language barrier is much less
4173017 contracts are being given more insulation with tougher service level agreements and break out clauses

4173021 if north korea were a person it would be wrapped in an old blanket muttering to itself on the sidewalk relief organizations send them boats full of rice since half the f ing country is starving to death and the norkie navy sinks the boats they buy stuff from other countries and dont accept the shipment or they accept it and dont pay for it this is not a policy thats going to produce large streams of foreign revenue
4173022 there are no days in life so memorable as those which vibrated to some stroke of the imagination
4173023 i think its been a long time coming it would have been nice to see the entire 40 percent initially but we know that the government cant really afford it now
4173024 ten percent increments over the next four years thatll do us good itll bring us close enough to the national standard itll help
4173025 this public law reflects our commitment to the men and women who daily place their lives on the front line for the welfare and safety of our island it is a measure that has been long overdue
4173026 its really not fair because our job especially compared to all other other law enforcement is much more technical and much more difficult
4173027 and now we have to revisit this because i dont know if i am in compliance
4173028 maybe youve been misinformed and someone else told you otherwise but that is why we are considered high risk by the u s department of education because we havent been following the guidelines set forth by the federal government
4173029 if you want to take a child to the movies how is that going to address reading language arts and math if you want to take a child to the museum how is that going to address reading language arts and math
4173030 if it does not address teaching and learning we are not going to fund it
4173031 so what you are saying is if they dont have a failing grade in reading language arts or math then they dont qualify
4173032 i hope some more parents come by to pick up the application
4173033 first of all the kids are in a safe environment and at the same time they are given more education opportunities because they are doing things that will help them learn
4173034 i guess this is a sign of the times deed is for latch key kids and parents must work all the time for their kids to qualify
4173035 im planning on putting my kids in deed this year because as a working parent its very hard to have them with me and do my job at the same time
4173036 at least with deed theyre able to do their homework and activities
4173037 to provide a high quality afterschool program that supplements the schools education program though a combination of structure and enjoyable activities
4173038 to create a nurturing environment that promotes a positive home school relationship

4173081 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4173082 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4173083 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4173084 ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
4173085 the only way a democratic party will have the credibility to elect a democrat in november is if the party uses a legitimate process to choose its nominee
4173086 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group
4173087 the problem with running a campaign thats based on cult of personality is that cracks in the grandiose facade of obamas life become very damaging
4173088 thats where you can get a readers attention and have substantial impact
4173089 is nothing but a series of lies that were long ago discredited
4173090 the reality is there are many lie filled books like this in the works cobbled together from the internet to make money off a presidential campaign
4173091 the book is going to change a lot of opinions
4173092 its a different version of the man than hes been presenting
4173093 this is an attempt to perpetuate those politics for four more years
4173094 one of the reasons i wrote this book is to keep obama from getting elected
4173095 as it became clear that he was going to win the democratic nomination for president it seemed irresponsible to stand by as so many were offering admiration piety even worship to of all things a politician because the idea of barack obama as a reformer is a great lie
4173096 one thing weve learned so far with biographies in the 21st century is that every book is going to be one persons take
4173097 man of the people the maverick life and career of john mccain
4173098 has benefited from some exciting events and storylines in the first few days
4173099 has taken these exciting events and made them even more compelling
4173100 great to be able to move between nbcs various channels to be able to pick up different sports
4173101 ton of content but trying to absorb it in some kind of a clean organized way is somewhat daunting
4173102 navigating through these thickets of programming is tough its fantastic so much content is airing but trying to get your arms around it is a challenge
4173103 portfolio of their network seems to be very targeted toward the various events
4173104 would it make sense to cross promote more for example to tell viewers whats ahead on cnbc by someone on usa
4173105 going in you knew the michael phelps story was an important one but with his early success it became a dominant story all phelps all the time is not a bad strategy for nbc at this point
4173106 obsession nbc has had for athlete profiles appears to have disappeared
4173107 to see analysis and commentary about the competition taking place or about to take place rather than a feature
4173108 great way to get both a sports and history education fix simultaneously
4173109 hasnt been too overwhelming on political issues which i think is good because were watching sports programming
4173110 shown just enough of beijing to be interesting in terms of china but its been mostly in the context of the athletes and the athletes touring so i think thats been done very well
4173111 no silver bullet to satisfy everyone when the games are taking place all the way around the world
4173112 every olympics where there is a time difference the broadcaster gets chided for their event selection
4173113 i believe nbc has actually addressed these types of comments very well by offering such a wide variety and tremendous volume of olympic coverage via its broadcast channels and on the web
4173114 by and large theyre working with a very difficult time differential and honestly i think theyre doing the best they can
4173115 i dont believe that most viewers are very concerned about this issue and the web does help by providing broader coverage and up to the minute results for those interested
4173116 should not forget that nbc paid for the right to bring special moments to their media platforms and for the most part people and advertisers today are willing to accept that as part of the business of sports television
4173117 viewers should not have to work so hard to figure out whats live
4173118 a little less of bob costas talking but thats minor
4173119 gives the broadcast something of an aura not too far removed from jim mckay and i am glad nbc keeps him as a prominent part of the team
4173120 arent really shilling for the games and the network and are telling the truth and criticizing officiating where necessary teddy atlas in boxing i think is notable
4173121 the key is finding the right announcers who combine expertise and audience friendliness and i think theyve done a great job with that
4173122 extensive broadcast offerings overcome any criticisms and help satisfy even the pickiest and most hard core olympic viewers
4173123 if the olympics are the benchmark of sports television in the digital age nbc has raised the bar with their coverage of the early part of the games
4173124 maintain momentum as swimming and gymnastics give way to track and field in the second week of the games
4173125 when it was motionless it was actually towed to the bay
4173126 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre
4173127 its not in the same context as the hole in the aeroplane or the grounding of the aircraft
4173128 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4173129 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4173157 by showcasing our extensive range of whole house brands in a disruptive setting we believe we can pay a respectful tribute to fashion where it comes to life each season and still offer an aspirational lifestyle that is inclusive the installation will play off our autumn campaign fallforward providing context for the ideal of designing for the future but living in the moment
4173158 i dont think a lot of people even know about it
4173159 close the lid and a large screw like auger turns and carries the waste to the burn chamber where the propane burner then bakes urine feces and paper into ashes
4173160 that jonathan krinn was no longer associated with the restaurant and that his dad the one who had been doing all the baking of that wonderful bread had left as well
4173161 shouldnt a restaurant like 2941 which is known for the work of its celebrity chef have some responsibility to its patrons to let them know that the chef is no longer there broadway shows with their celebrities always let it be known when the star has left or is being replaced if restaurants trade on the celebrity of their chefs shouldnt they do the same
4173162 we tried to get the word out about our chef change in every way via the posts online food flash a press release e newsletter and even a postcard mailed to 9 000 of our regular customers

4173164 in the instance that a server does not ask you please make it clear that you are not in a hurry going to a movie play etc or do or do not have somewhere to be servers are in charge of reading your table
4173165 but we are not mind readers and if you tell me that you are in a hurry dont either order your steaks well done or complain that you are just finishing your appetizer when your main course comes out that might be the only way we can get you out on time
4173166 ive been curious to understand why most restaurants serve orders for children with a warning that plate is very hot
4173167 this holds true whether the children ordered off a childrens menu or off the regular menu while i understand the need to keep food hot under heat lamps and assume this is why the plate is very hot it would make sense to move orders for children onto cooler plates before serving have you ever tried to keep a hungry 4 year old from touching his plate while eating his chicken fingers it is a nearly impossible task and we frequently end up with hot fingers
4173168 it would cost three times as much as they cost to ship them
4173169 i have it on good authority that neither the lamb nor the chicken had a name
4173170 but do you eat your chicken with your fingers or a knife

4173174 many things have changed at le gavroche over the years but to me the biggest change has been the food culture in britain
4173175 back in the day you could count the number of great restaurants on one hand and the british public wasnt as sophisticated as it is today
4173176 but things really have moved on and today britain has a fantastic culinary offering that is appreciated by the public
4173177 three years back we thought cipla might do it every one of them has had problems

4173179 we considered that although emissions at the refinery might be reduced on a per barrel basis the increased production of the refinery by 325 000 barrels per day would increase the total overall emissions from the refinery

4173183 i have participated in my share of vigorous public debates over issues of great consequence and the public has been free to accept or reject the decisions i made when they walked into a ballot booth drew the curtain and cast their vote i didnt always win but i always respected the process voting is an immense privilege that is why i am concerned about a new development that could deny this freedom to many americans
4173184 instead of a private election with a secret ballot overseen by an impartial federal board union organizers would simply need to gather signatures from more than 50 of the employees in a work place or bargaining unit
4173185 we cannot be a party that strips workers of the right to a secret ballot election we are the party that always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
4173186 and disrupt a tried and trusted method for conducting an honest election

4173201 porque queremos mostrar las terribles consecuencias que de llevarse acaso la m 50 traer consigo en nuestro dibujo los rboles est n secos no hay bonitas casas de madera ni tampoco hay un bonito entorno donde pasear

4173218 nothing astonishes men so much as common sense and plain dealing

4173228 i expect to see more bank failures but they will be smaller banks
4173229 if the order of announcement was that the brokerage houses and the investment banks had access to the fed window prior to the bear stearns situation bear stearns would still be here today
4173230 i think the numbers that came out today suggest that demand weakness in the u s could continue
4173231 refiners seem to anticipate demand falling a lot more than it really has
4173232 refinery utilization is now so far behind where it was a year ago that even with the dollar as a strong backdrop it was hard to get excited about supply
4173233 the assumption is that inflation is not going to be a concern going forward

4173240 we believe our ima hybrid system is best suited for smaller vehicles where the fuel efficiency gains are the greatest

4173245 ruth interesting your comment very astute my problem and for others is such swell ideas must be enthusiastically accepted and then utilized example in sudan a cheap serviceable terracotta charcoal stove burner was being produced as a development project with a bright local sudanese in charge he was selling and giving them away to local house wives they resemble cookers traditionally produced in kenya they are fuel efficient compared to the 10 liter square tin container made into a cooker with a hatchway to feed in wood charcoal or other stuff compared to the pottery stove it is very inefficient but although women readily accepted the new stove the y persisted in using the current one hence i observed the women in the kitchen the answer was obvious the tin had a square cooking area stew pot and tea water could be utilized at the same time even a small third container could sometimes be accommodated the pottery stove was round with space for only one pot the matter is serious as fuel is easily one third of family income i proceeded to develop a more useful economical stove my sudanese colleague became disinterested as he already had project approval from an aid fund for the single burner stove to go back to ask for another fund to further develop an improved version he felt was unacceptable i proceeded to design an improved cooker with another colleague i departed sudan soon after and the delighted worker took the improved ve rsion to his family s kitchen the moral of the story is clear

4173251 many of mr obamas victory rallies have had a shattering intensity about them he stirs the crowds energy but he feeds on it too and in st paul they seemed to inspire him not for the first time mr obamas campaign managers picked an indoor sports stadium as the venue for their rally this time an ice hockey hall in which four tiers of seating towered far above the stage the next time it stages a professional hockey game it is going to seem a little sedate mr obama performed in the middle of a force field of noise which mingled the joy and relief and hope he has kindled in his followers

4173269 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4173270 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4173271 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4173272 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4173273 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4173274 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
4173275 we call this a sea borne aircraft carrier system which will be based on the northern and pacific fleets
4173276 both sides believe that creating a global missile defence system including deploying such systems in certain regions of the world or plans for such co operation do not help support strategic balance and stability and harm international efforts to control arms and the non proliferation process
4173277 some dont like such strategic cooperation between our countries but we understand that this cooperation serves the interests of our people and we will strengthen it regardless of whether others like it or not

4173286 moscow claims it is merely defending the rights of ethnic minorities in south ossetia and abkhazia which have been trying to break from georgia since the early 1990s but its ambitions go far beyond that prime minister vladimir putin appears determined to reimpose by force and intimidation as much of the old soviet sphere of influence as he can get away with
4173287 the united states and its european allies must tell mr putin in the clearest possible terms that such aggression will not be tolerated and that there will be no redivision of europe
4173288 are the flash points of the 21st centurys great game and the issue is who will gain control over the caspian basin the richest depository of strategic resources next to the middle east
4173289 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
4173290 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia
4173291 the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline is only a minor element in a much larger strategic equation an attempt sponsored largely by the united states but eagerly subscribed to by several of its new ex soviet allies to reduce every aspect of russian influence throughout the region whether it be economic political diplomatic or military

4173328 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4173329 it seems to me the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively
4173330 to all parts of former member states of the soviet union about trying to integrate with the west and move out of the long time russian sphere of influence
4173331 had an opportunity to make some very broad points and i think they seized that opportunity

4173348 sebagai mantan deputi gubernur senior bi saya bisa saja bertemu dengan orang orang bi karena pertemuannya di rumah ya saya kasih makan namun saya nasihati mereka seperti saya juga menasihati gubernur bi burhanuddin abdullah untuk mengembalikan dana tersebut tetapi kesempatan itu tidak dimanfaatkan padahal kalau dimanfaatkan sebagai ketua bpk saya berwenang menulis bahwa dana itu sudah dikembalikan dan tidak merugikan negara
4173349 saya tidak pernah dipanggil oleh wakil presiden jusuf kalla jk mengenai hal ini siapa pun tidak boleh mencampuri kegiatan kpk
4173350 ini kasus pertama di perusahaan kami kami menyesalkan kejadian ini atas nama perusahaan seluruh biaya pengobatan pasien kami yang menanggung
4173351 kami sudah sekitar 15 tahun makan pada bu rosmawati di jalan selamat tidak jauh dari pabrik
4173352 pada hari ini kamis 14 8 terdapat 70 pekerja jumlah mereka yang keracunan belum bisa kami pastikan
4173353 meski demikian belum ada seorang pasien pun yang dalam kondisi kritis kami berharap mereka segera lekas sembuh dari sakitnya
4173354 itu artinya harus ada anggaran belanja lain yang dihemat antara lain 10 persen dari subsidi bbm dan listrik itu setara rp 32 3 triliun
4173355 kami ingin memasukkan pada termohon dalam hal ini pemerintah agar sebelum pengujian selesai legal standing nya kedudukan hukumnya jangan dicabut dahulu karena kami dengar pemohon akan segera dieksekusi jika terjadi hal itu akan menjadi pertanyaan konstitusi apakah orang yang sudah meninggal dunia masih memiliki hak konstitusional atau tidak
4173356 secure our nation by employing world class cyberspace capabilities to control cyberspace create integrated global effects and deliver sovereign options
4173357 transfers of manpower and resources including activation and reassignment of units shall be halted
4173358 the air force remains committed to providing full spectrum cyber capabilities to include global command and control electronic warfare and network defense
4173359 the secretary and chief of staff of the air force have considered delaying currently planned actions on air force cyber command to allow ample time for a comprehensive assessment of all afcyber requirements and to synchronize the afcyber mission with other key air force initiatives
4173360 the new air force leaders continue to make a fresh assessment of all our efforts to provide our nation and the joint force the full spectrum of air space and cyberspace capabilities
4173361 a single individual a small group or a nation state can exact damage and destruction similar to dropping a bomb or explosives
4173362 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4173363 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4173364 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4173365 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4173366 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4173367 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4173368 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4173369 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded
4173370 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4173371 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4173372 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4173373 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4173374 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4173375 the similarities between the companies in the bus crash and the one we dealt with are shockingly similar
4173376 basically they started the second company because they ran afoul of the law with the first one so they willingly broke the law to make a profit
4173377 raise those liability limits raise those limits to where you have to be a legitimate company to want to pay these limits number 1 number 2 we have to get more government oversight
4173378 we went down into a bunker everything was already burning grad rockets began coming down in great numbers it killed lots of people there was blood everywhere
4173379 you wouldnt believe that this is a spot where a person was almost killed
4173380 the fire was so bad people werent even left with a handkerchief
4173381 we just finished this house where will we live now
4173382 its estimated there will be a global warming of 1 to 6 degrees by the end of the century and we examined how this could manifest at smaller spatial scales and within shorter time periods
4173383 we identified areas likely to be most responsive to changes in greenhouse gas emissions
4173384 one interesting and surprising result is that we see the same hot spot patterns even at lower greenhouse gas concentrations
4173385 this suggests we may be able to see these hot spots emerging already
4173386 we believe our ima hybrid system is best suited for smaller vehicles where the fuel efficiency gains are the greatest
4173387 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it and that is our goal for this new hybrid model to make it affordable for a new generation of car buyers
4173388 communities had been told the land was theirs now its contested
4173389 they were told by the government go out and prospect
4173390 you dont want to be a hostile element in the environment its an investor choice you see a lot of abuse
4173391 in places like ghana you can do all sorts of things you can take a logging concession you can strip the land and destroy it give nothing back to local communities
4173392 theres been very little effort to make sure that any of that money actually gets down to communities as opposed to being captured by local elites
4173393 carbon markets could be the match that sets it all off
4173394 it will encourage the resolution of disputed land claims a lot of these are not being resolved simply out of inertia
4173395 even in the diamond business consumers and producers found out that people get angry wont buy from conflict areas the oil and gas industry are dealing in commodities which are very hard to trace by and large carbon offsets are much more exposed to public scrutiny subject of legislation
4173396 theres no point in blaming bankers wanting to make profits
4173397 treatment of solar water heaters under the expanded national renewable energy target scheme will have implications for the cost of the scheme the liquidity of the permits market and the amount of electricity generated by renewables in 2020
4173398 the clear intention of this statement is the removal of renewable energy credits from solar hot water
4173399 the effect of breaking this pre election promise would be to increase the cost of solar hot water systems by between 1000 and 1500
4173400 rheem is deeply concerned and surprised that the discussion paper on the expanded scheme should canvass options that include the elimination of solar water heaters from the scheme
4173401 any attempt to retreat on this commitment will leave manufacturers dealers and installers of water heaters with significant stranded investment in a difficult economy
4173402 it was an amazing journey i visited forests witnessed illegal and industrial logging toured pulp mills and paper factories and met many inspiring people who explained the environmental and social impacts of paper manufacture and what we can all do to reduce them
4173403 most people think of paper as a harmless natural product but in fact the paper industry causes three times as much climate change emissions as aviation uses more water than any other industrial product as well as threatening forests and human rights in some producer countries
4173404 fortunately there is a lot that we can all do like recycling and reducing junk mail to lessen our paper footprints
4173405 with a satisfying sense of empowerment that you can crack your paper addiction
4173406 ive been writing away for years with no sign of a book and now three have come along at once
4173407 i was thinking about it the other day and i cant imagine that
4173408 i cant imagine what that guy was going through and how good he was thats just amazing
4173409 there is no place in california where frogs are still thriving
4173410 said in a statement that the company viewed price differences based on sex to be a lawful business strategy and not a civil rights matter
4173411 men cost the club more in part because they are more likely to fail to pay their bills
4173412 courts and civil rights panels in california colorado florida iowa maryland and new jersey have ruled that price discrimination against men is unlawful
4173413 in illinois michigan and washington judges have stated that it can be part of an acceptable business strategy
4173414 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4173415 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4173416 i am not going to provide false promises i am not going to provide false guarantees about there being some simple solution here
4173417 i am trying to turn around a situation which has evolved over many years and we are dealing with the real consequences of climate change
4173418 what we need is an independent forensic audit which details where the water is who controls it and what the best use of the water is

4173440 euh cest a la communaut gaie celle qui pourrait me supporter pas s r que a me rassure

4173442 it looks a little south beach y she doesnt look like shes going to the office
4173443 would near 7 percent in 2008 a 27 year high but taper off next year
4173444 the uncertain external environment may weigh on growth and inflation could become entrenched
4173445 based on market estimates total losses at three singaporean banks may amount to us 0 3 billion about 3 percent of aggregate bank capital
4173446 compared to us 144 billion in the united states and us 123 billion in europe about 15 and 9 percent of aggregate bank capital respectively
4173447 after reaching about 24 percent of gdp in 2007 the current account surplus dropped to around 14 percent of seasonally adjusted gdp in the first quarter of this year as the trade balance shrunk
4173448 since end 2006 official reserves and the forward book have increased by a combined us 73 billion to us 268 billion or about 140 percent of gdp
4173449 while direct exposure to the united states has declined total exposure accounting for trade via third countries has remained stable at about 30 percent of gdp during the last decade
4173450 moreover u s holdings of singaporean securities have risen to about 35 percent of gdp suggesting a channel for adverse balance sheet and wealth effects in the case of portfolio rebalancing
4173451 a 1 percentage point decline in u s growth could lower growth in singapore by about 0 9 percentage point directly and through other trading partners about twice the impact of ten years ago
4173452 a stronger singapore dollar over the near term would support disinflation and anchor inflation expectations at a lower level it would also make room for more fiscal loosening including additional targeted measures to cushion the impact of the rising cost of living once inflation pressures abate the rebalancing of the policy mix could be pursued further by expanding public expenditure on physical and social infrastructures a medium term policy priority for the authorities higher spending can be afforded by ample fiscal reserves which under current policies would continue to rise

4173469 there is an acute food shortage and the situation has been rated as alarming
4173470 if theyre not going to do anything right then there are a lot of us who arent going to go
4173471 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values
4173472 many buyers with long term expectations are getting exceptional value in the current market once the inventory is drawn down price pressure will return because the costs of construction are rising todays buyers are very well positioned to build wealth over time
4173473 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4173474 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4173475 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4173476 prices having fallen sharply and quickly in very distressed markets but most or all of the price declines may have already occurred in these areas since buyers have now returned to those markets
4173477 i dont know if he told the media but it was no secret to us that he was looking for a 100 million to 120 million contract i dont think this franchise is going to give out that kind of money

4173512 its a nice representation of how people are always unwittingly on a conveyor belt taking them through time to their destiny
4173513 these alarming findings clearly show that a partially open smoking area is still an unsafe environment where people are exposed to harmful levels of secondhand smoke
4173514 the situation is unacceptable and confirms that the 2007 changes to the law did not go far enough to protect patrons or workers
4173515 nsw should effectively separate smoking areas from working including eating spaces
4173516 we work really hard to engender trust and loyalty and commitment from netflix members we take this extremely seriously this hurts us that were not serving our members as they expect us to

4173532 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good

4173537 when rory kennedy told her mother ethel kennedy that she was going to make a documentary about helen thomas the former mrs
4173538 she has a compelling personal story she was very determined to be a journalist at a young age
4173539 i think it is also the story of the role of journalism in america and the role of journalism in a democracy
4173540 your decision to invade iraq has caused the deaths of thousands of americans and iraqis
4173541 every reason given has turned out not to be true my question is why did you really want to go to war
4173542 there is a blackout now i believe until the end of his term
4173543 i do share her analysis of what happened in the lead up to the war the press did not do their job adequately the press has changed over the past 30 years helen has remained true to her craft despite the shift
4173544 i never had the potential nobody made a pass at me darn it
4173545 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard
4173546 i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified because i know from just what im hearing that theres an incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like okay its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama
4173547 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans
4173548 you are entitled to your opinions but you are not entitled to your own facts

4173559 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4173560 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4173561 now may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy spirit
4173562 oh your little boys ride the short bus dont they
4173563 oh i had an idea and then i just made it
4173564 the grand jury found that lavalle was in complete control of paying bills and writing payroll and benefits checks by 2001 lavalles salary was 78 000 which was considered a large amount for such a small beaver county non profit agency
4173565 the grand jury found that in 2005 lavalle earned more than 102 000 and in 2006 she earned more than 122 000
4173566 were not going to just pick it up and start it at the front of the assembly line again weve got a process were still going to package it up take it to the dumpster schedule a pickup
4173567 i like the way you modulate your voice too many white preachers drone along in a monotone and thats hard for folks to listen to
4173568 the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but their inward significance
4173569 the eating quality of such product is less than ideal and can be damaging to the industry
4173570 we have no intention for the coming season of putting the same rule in place
4173571 we will look at russia but all the stars lined up better for china
4173572 were dealing with a number of suppliers on a one on one basis at some point we may need to name them but at the moment we are working with those suppliers and making progress
4173573 for them to be prosecuted twice and found guilty on both occasions that to me implies a certain amount of intent
4173574 keeping secret the names of a small minority who offend against the councils pollution rules gives an impression the council is firmly on the side of polluters rather than the wider community and the environment names of the worst polluters should not only be supplied to us the green party they should be listed on the councils website and available to everyone so there is real pressure
4173575 there is a feeling that things are slowing down in general reflected in a slight drop in employment levels and a tight rein on input purchases stocks of finished products are also sitting higher than most manufacturers are comfortable with
4173576 were in a funny stage people are thinking about the election and possible changes thinking about how to get from here to there without having a clear idea about any changes
4173577 when we are coming into an election there is a tendency to defer business decisions even though the result is unlikely to tip their decision one way or another it is an atmosphere of wait and see
4173578 there are factors now riding to the rescue of new zealands manufacturing sector but its part of the rebalancing story however there are that many more existing and emerging issues weighing against any immediate relief for the sector
4173579 the latter might help relieve the raw material cost pressures that were adding to the distress of manufacturing profitability yet we cant get too sanguine about manufacturing prospects at least not for the foreseeable future
4173580 its great to be a part of a project that benefits the local economy while looking after the environment
4173581 the cast and crew really got behind this initiative and we are proud to be a part of the new generation of sustainable film makers
4173582 wolverine was enthusiastic to be involved they were willingly audited and the results were outstanding
4173583 the outcome is you can watch the new movie in the knowledge that it comes with a significantly reduced carbon footprint
4173584 the production made 670 tonnes of waste 615 tonnes or 92 of which was diverted from the landfill saving the film company an estimated 55 000
4173585 lots of people will think shes young but its not an issue i will step up
4173586 people are finally expressing their opinion there is a lot of support for cannabis law reform but some people dont agree with the 4 20 smoke up protest
4173587 it cost our company a lot of money and a lot of grief as the woman was badly injured
4173588 we got the right people to design and build a new winch system which is fail safe if any electrical mechanical or hydraulic mechanism fails the brakes come on and the plane remains suspended
4173589 when he left mr emerson simply didnt have staff with the necessary experience to keep the plane serviced and the hi tech fly by wire ride operational
4173590 i checked with osh in the last six weeks and they said there was nothing untoward they made no requests for upgrades and they had no concerns about safety
4173591 they were actually boiling some solvent on the stove and also he was working on the one pot it blew up in their face
4173592 when they got that odor and then when they went in it appeared to be what looked like a meth lab was set up
4173593 thats extremely dangerous not only to the citizens but the explosion risks that it creates
4173594 between bullitt county and the rest of our state weve had about four explosions at least two people go to the hospital already
4173595 the information security office has a policy of having a good discussion with campus users whose accounts have been compromised rather than issue warnings we discuss what actually happened why it happened what the implications are and how users can prevent anything similar happening again
4173596 to prevent falling victim to these kind of scams the key message for any computer user is that they must treat all their logins and passwords with the same care as any other pin never give it out to any other person
4173597 when you pull up the traps there is this horrible stinking snot everywhere no one ever wanted to work with me but i suppose its paying off now
4173598 youre like a detective and i like that im continually surprised by what we are finding it keeps you on your game
4173599 it is more likely that history would record miag by its actions in destabilising the governance of both companies has in itself been the cause of slowing the progress of industry consolidation
4173600 miags request is simple sff should hold a meeting to vote on consolidation not just the pgg wrightson partnership it is the shareholders right to decide whether sff should pursue consolidation and a national champion
4173601 we have a firm option on the table to be voted on whereas miag requirements are about a process as opposed to a concrete transaction
4173602 we have found 60 of the causeway is so deteriorated that it cant be preserved
4173603 we are in a holding pattern until the conservator gets here
4173604 we trust that advice is good advice and the city is still working towards the conservation of the material
4173605 we dont know what we will do with the 40 if possible we will put it on display
4173606 people think its only an upset tummy it may be for them but if you are already ill in hospital you dont want that brought in
4173607 heres a security with an a rating people are far more conscious of banks raising capital and telecom is another name in the market with a credit rating
4173608 i was not surprised by the demand its a flight to quality and another place with a credit rating for investors to put funds
4173609 it is encouraging the new zealand debt market can still offer significant financing for well rated corporates despite these uncertain times on global capital markets
4173610 we feel the sense of frustration and the anger of others acutely we are often the last people standing between a young person and a life of crime and incarceration and we take this responsibility seriously
4173611 management considered that it would be very difficult to meet the structural changes that would be necessary to meet certification requirements given the physical limitations of the ldh facility
4173612 an interim relief option to be called upon when necessary
4173613 the sdhb formally agreed to this request obviously with the clear understanding that certain modifications would be necessary to achieve this short term objective
4173614 for reasons we cant understand the dhb has chosen not to update the standard or expand the capacity of these elderly care beds for over twenty years
4173615 plan change 24 is set amid increasing national concerns about housing affordability the gap between house prices and incomes continues to grow and home ownership rates continue to fall
4173616 while these trends are reasonable cause for concern they are not automatic grounds for intervention
4173617 indeed the costs of intervention can far outweigh the benefits so one must clearly establish a need before going any further
4173618 one could argue that council has misconstrued high staff turnover as evidence of housing unaffordability when in fact it is a natural consequence of the districts highly seasonal demand
4173619 while there are definite district and nationwide concerns about house prices there is not a clear need for council intervention
4173620 my review suggests that housing affordability issues are nowhere near as serious as council perceives
4173621 rather than identifying all the relevant stakeholders then quantifying or even listing the various costs and benefits that each will face it instead makes a series of sweeping unsubstantiated statements
4173622 i consider this lack of analysis to be quite incredible
4173623 how can a policy with such far reaching effects be supported by a section 32 report that fails to quantify the relevant costs and benefits let alone even describe them
4173624 indeed this evaluation falls well short of the standard required by central government so why should it suffice for local government
4173625 il sentimento pi forte e pi antico dellanimo umano la paura e la paura pi grande quella dellignoto
4173626 i saw the need for bandwidth growing in sweden and internationally and the expectation that high capacity networks will need to be built seemed reasonable
4173627 at that stage the company had two products but nothing had reached volume but the market is finally increasing
4173628 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4173629 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4173630 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
4173631 we have driven the rate of biological extinction the permanent loss of species up several hundred times beyond its historical levels and are threatened with the loss of a majority of all species by the end of the 21st century

4173633 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4173634 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4173635 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4173643 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4173644 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4173645 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we have hoped that he would be true to his word and that those operations will halt
4173646 both sides agree that it is in the best interest of party unity and making sure that everyones voice and vote is honored to make sure her name is put into nomination
4173647 its to honor everyone who worked so hard on both sides

4173686 we are really pleased that scott will be heading this effort to implement the california statewide mls
4173687 scotts impressive accomplishments in our industry extensive experience in devising and employing innovative technologies and proven business acumen will serve calmls and california realtors r well as we develop the calmls vision into the mls of the future
4173688 we are very excited to have scott on board because he brings exactly the right expertise to lead this forward thinking project through its implementation stage and beyond
4173689 his experience in the real estate industry underscores our commitment that calmls will be designed to improve the working lives of real estate brokers and salespeople through technology thats cutting edge and cost effective
4173690 scott has a proven track record of leading large teams of people to achieve superior results hes demonstrated his ability to identify and expand new markets streamline complex systems and create more efficient processes in real estate through even better uses of technology best practices
4173691 the multiple listing service is the bedrock of real estate on which so many of the other important services that realtors provide rests
4173692 california realtorswho sell property in the countrys largest and most diverse state deserve an innovative reliable and flexible statewide system that will allow them to access the data they need in a timely and efficient way im looking forward to leading calmls and to working with c a r management and californias realtors to make the calmls vision of a statewide property centric database a reality
4173693 its absolutely out of the ordinary and shocking to everybody around here both the university and the neighbors
4173694 we are facing the first demand driven agriculture market in modern times
4173695 it is widely believed that a tight global food supply is a long term situation and the demand for potash will continue to increase
4173696 udah sana berangkat jangan sampe sakit lagi kan dulu janjinya ga ada lagi ceritanya
4173697 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4173698 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4173699 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4173700 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4173701 as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4173702 im interested in good relations between the united states and russia
4173703 but in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations
4173704 this is not an attempt to put military assets in closer proximity to inject u s forces into this conflict
4173705 i wouldnt expect a naval ship to be showing up in the black sea until weve determined what precisely the need is
4173706 the reality is the road home program has been a dysfunctional program since its inception
4173707 the solution is not now to impose an arbitrary deadline for those applications
4173708 if we see an overall adverse effect to all homeowners were going to be reconsidering
4173709 our goal is to get people the money they need as quickly as possible
4173710 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4173711 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4173712 the south is a sweet poison i believe faulkner wrote that
4173713 lo avrei provato con ibrahimovic in una squadra che difensivamente sta crescendo
4173714 una squadra sar in campo sottolinea il tecnico portoghese e laltra ad appiano gentile ad allenarsi con preparatori atletici e staff medico cordoba materazzi samuel vieira chivu rivas adriano e dacourt un peccato che adriano non possa giocare si rammarica mourinho ai microfoni di inter channel perch la squadra ha lavorato molto per giocare bene contro lajax ed altrettanto bene questa settimana pensando di poter giocare con il brasiliano in attacco al fianco di ibrahimovic peccato non vederli insieme in una squadra che dal punto di vista dellorganizzazione difensiva sta crescendo molto bene
4173715 tutto il lavoro degli ultimi 15 giorni ora va riposto in un cassetto e aspettiamo che adriano possa ritornare nuovamente in gruppo la squadra comunque sta lavorando bene e abbiamo fiducia nel futuro
4173716 sono le partite che dobbiamo giocare e vincere prima della sosta di campionato una sosta che sar per noi importante perch alla ripresa anche gli infortunati potranno essere in condizione di giocare
4173717 i want to do something that will make a difference
4173718 it made sense to begin our trip here in washington
4173719 because the state is a hub for technology it was a perfect launching pad in starting our efforts to raise awareness of the importance of stem disciplines
4173720 i started out college not knowing what to do and i didnt study very hard didnt do very well
4173721 once i had been out of school for a year and worked for an engineering firm i realized that was something i was interested in i got excited about it and that led to a degree in mathematics
4173722 sometimes it takes someone outside of our normal circle of friends and family to shine a light in our direction and help us along
4173723 as i set out on this bike ride and try to make the learning practical and fun i hope to also show students that it takes commitment and effort both mental and physical to accomplish your goals
4173724 the mautner project improves the health of lesbians bisexual and transgender women who partner with women and their families through advocacy education research and direct service the mautner project envisions a healthcare system that is guided by social justice and responsive to the needs of all people
4173725 i am taking part in full training with the team although im not yet playing the matches i hope that next week i will be able to
4173726 i always thought i would be able to give my contribution to the team then unfortunately i had the operation and i had to stay out for two months and i could not help my team mates
4173727 anyway its better to make mistakes now we are in the preparation period instead of at the start of the season
4173728 from the first match of the season we have to show we are a strong team that wants to reach objectives
4173729 the important thing is that for the start of the season everyone is available i am quite close to coming back but i hope that the other injured players are available to the coach
4173730 did i play well okay then please send a video of the match to dunga
4173731 this is a great club now its up to me to improve with an extra bit of quality and win my place on the national team
4173732 estos son mis principios pero si no le gustan tengo otros
4173733 the only professional virtualisation solution that is freely available as open source software under the gnu general public license gpl why this matters is because its truly free as in freedom
4173734 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4173735 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4173736 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4173737 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4173738 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4173739 he made a map to find his lost spider and then he followed it only it didnt lead to the spider
4173740 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4173741 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4173742 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4173743 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4173744 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4173745 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4173746 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4173747 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4173748 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4173749 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4173750 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4173751 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4173752 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4173753 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4173754 he is coming back right away so that tells you something
4173755 how to use your common sense and remain polite in a human society
4173756 yes for the love of baby jesus we can hear you now
4173757 hey hows it going hows your sea bass isnt the wine delicious
4173758 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4173759 give veterans the option to use a simple plastic card to receive timely and accessible care
4173760 rural veterans greater access to va sponsored care exclusively through provide providers
4173761 the vas specialized health care programs would suffer irreparable impact by the loss of veterans from those programs
4173762 the vas medical and prosthetic research program would lose focus and purpose were service connected and other enrolled veterans no longer present in va health care
4173763 they would lose the many safeguards built into the va system through its patient safety program evidence based medicine electronic medical records and bar code medication administration
4173764 lower quality of care for those who deserve it most
4173765 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
4173766 if other health care providers followed the vas lead it would be a major step toward improving the quality of care across the u s health care system
4173767 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4173768 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4173769 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4173770 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4173771 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4173772 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4173773 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4173774 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4173775 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4173776 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4173777 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4173778 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4173779 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4173780 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4173781 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4173782 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4173783 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4173784 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4173785 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4173786 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4173787 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4173788 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4173789 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4173790 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4173791 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4173792 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4173793 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4173794 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4173795 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4173796 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4173797 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4173798 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4173799 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4173800 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4173801 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4173802 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4173803 high tech innovation job growth telemedicine distance learning rural development public safety and e government
4173804 very few people with dial up took the test because it took too long about 15 percent of americans still connect to the internet with a dial up connection so the median speeds in this report are actually higher than if dial up internet users had chosen to participate in the survey in other words even these dismal statistics paint a rosier picture than the reality
4173805 bring me the sunflower to plant in my garden here where the salt of the flung spray has parched a place and all day to the long and mirroring air let it turn the ardor of its yellow face
4173806 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4173807 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4173808 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4173809 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4173810 we are so happy the whole team were very excited to show a good competition
4173811 a lot of people didnt believe in the german team after we lost the team gold in last years european championships
4173812 the whole team were really helping each other and we have tried to get the best for everybody that was the key to our success
4173813 the fact that financials are on the mend is part of whats giving the market buoyancy today
4173814 the only hope that this market has is that with the commodity prices having come down fairly substantially over the last month or so that trend will continue if it continues it will go a long way in helping the fed not have to raise rates
4173815 participate in everything from how they develop vehicles to they communicate with you
4173816 we had a really staggered preparation after the european championship
4173817 there is little coordination between different sections of the team
4173818 he has to get the team to play successful good football as we are used to
4173819 the club has done everything to make his job comfortable juergen has turned many things upside down now we need the results otherwise the changes and the investment are useless
4173820 the data are higher than expected and should push treasury rates higher although with energy and other commodity prices having come down the markets may discount some of these data as old news
4173821 still the level is holding above 400 000 and it seems to reflect mostly labor market weakness
4173822 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4173823 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4173824 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate
4173825 in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services
4173826 may be extremely valuable and significantly increase stockholder value as a separate business
4173827 in the range of a couple of million to one in favor of it being them
4173828 but theyre not necessarily the implications people think they are for example some believers are going to say well this challenges the resurrection i dont know why if jesus rose from one tomb he couldnt have risen from the other tomb
4173829 the historical religious and archaeological evidence show that the place where christ was buried is the church of the resurrection
4173830 contradicts the religious principles and the historic and spiritual principles that we hold tightly to
4173831 i dont think that christians are going to buy into this
4173832 but skeptics in general would like to see something that pokes holes into the story that so many people hold dear
4173833 on a scale of one through 10 10 being completely probably a one maybe a one and a half
4173834 the names on the caskets are the most common names found among jews at the time
4173835 i dont think the james ossuary came from the same cave
4173836 if it were found there the man who made the forgery would have taken something better he would have taken jesus
4173837 when i make a f in deal i want to make sure that i know exactly what im doing and what im sayin is a few investments in my district
4173838 legitimately when i say legitimately im talking about so these bastards up here cant say to me jesus christ ah this happened then he someone else in order to get immunity so he doesnt go to jail he starts talking and fingering people and then the son of a b all falls apart
4173839 after weve done some business then i might change my mind
4173840 yesterday feb 1 democrat congressman frank topper thompson called and told me that murtha was ready to go
4173841 during january that he was not ready to do business but would be willing to do so in the future
4173842 congressman murtha of pennsylvania would be willing to enter into an agreement similar to that of the other congressmen
4173843 hitler had been brought up as a catholic and was impressed by the
4173844 i am convinced that i am acting as the agent of our almighty creator
4173845 my feelings as a christian points me to my lord and savior as a fighter
4173846 finally they made the mistake of attacking the catholic church and split their forces instead of concentrating them
4173847 the leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category
4173848 from political considerations he restrained his anti clericalism seeing clearly the dangers of strengthening the church by persecution
4173849 the best thing is to let christianity die a natural death when understanding of the universe has become widespread christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity christianity has reached the peak of absurdity and thats why someday its structure will collapse the only way to get rid of christianity is to allow it to die little by little christianity the liar well see to it that the churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the state
4173850 christianity is an invention of sick brains one could imagine nothing more senseless nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the godhead into a mockery when all is said we have no reason to wish that the italians and spaniards should free themselves from the drug of christianity lets be the only people who are immunised against the disease
4173851 the f hrer is deeply religious but deeply anti christian he regards christianity as a symptom of decay
4173852 mak ing different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category
4173853 to derive the greatest possible advantage for his movement from those old sources of power
4173854 what the hitler government envisioned for germany was clearly set out in a thirty point program for the national reich church drawn up during the war by rosenberg an outspoken pagan who among his older offices held that of the fuehrers delegate for the entire intellectual and philosophical education and instruction for the national socialist party
4173855 1 the national reich church of germany categorically claims the exclusive right and the exclusive power to control all churches within the borders of the reich it declares these to be national churches of the german reich
4173856 5 the national church is determined to exterminate irrevocably the strange and foreign christian faiths imported into germany in the ill omened year 800
4173857 7 the national church has no scribes pastors chaplains or priests but national reich orators are to speak in them
4173858 13 the national church demands immediate cessation of the publishing and dissemination of the bible in germany
4173859 14 the national church declares that to it and therefore to the german nation it has been decided that the fuehrers
4173860 18 the national church will clear away from its altars all crucifixes bibles and pictures of saints
4173861 my story is the story of every person of faith a mix of contingency and eternity
4173862 the more i discovered about that long endeavor the more amazed i was by it yes you will cite the terrible parts of its history parts i have not shied from myself but you have missed so much more the more i questioned and asked the more history and theology i engaged in the more i used
4173863 why would i want to forget all of that precious inheritance the humility of mary the foolishness of peter the genius of paul the candor of augustine the genius of francis the glory of chartres cathedral the haunting music of tallis the art of michelangelo the ecstasies of teresa the rigor of ignatius the whole astonishing ravishing panoply of ancient christianity that suddenly arrived at my door in a banal little town in an ordinary family in the grim nights of the 1970s in england
4173864 why would a human being not look at the unclean glass he is born with and ask what is this that i have been given
4173865 as a simple piece of historical inquiry its an astonishingly unlikely turn of events
4173866 that is an empirical question and it merits an empirical answer
4173867 sure hes not ideal but were at war and hell wage it
4173868 its time to split with our friends the unions and the democratic party and put our kids first
4173869 and while were at it why dont we talk about some humanitarian reforms
4173870 why are you running from us like youre running from your responsibility to this little girl
4173871 oh youre going to be deadbeat on the ground if you dont shut up
4173872 it devastates me because i dont feel like i have a dad i just feel like hes a man
4173873 people need to know that if theyre not going to meet their court ordered obligation to pay child support there are going to be felony consequences criminal charges
4173874 why dont you do a story about fathers rights and the state of wisconsin and how screwed up it is

4173885 when demand for homes drops ordinary sellers will take their homes off the market let them sit or reduce their prices in small increments but banks will slash prices to where the homes will sell quickly
4173886 the biggest home sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4173887 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4173888 loan officers are reporting that they are still tightening underwriting standards
4173889 we expect that sales volume which has leveled off some will drop another 10 over the next few months over this credit squeeze
4173890 bogus doorstep sellers will stop at nothing to part you from your money
4173891 it is permissible for a muslim to kill an apostate a convert from islam

4173897 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4173898 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4173899 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4173900 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4173901 the people behind this effort want to make south dakota the first step in a long term campaign to mount a legal challenge to roe vs wade
4173902 it seems desperate to me that they would hold a press conference in washington d c
4173903 people in south dakota dont like it if they think someone nationally is trying to tell them what to do
4173904 it is a cynical effort i believe by anti choice groups to simply use the state of south dakota and the voters of south dakota to do their ultimate goal
4173905 which is to challenge the fundamental right of women in this country that supported the right decision to make these personal decisions
4173906 the first ballot measure was designed for south dakota and south dakota only
4173907 this time it is designed to go to the supreme court
4173908 terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
4173909 a lot of people just want change right now and sen obama represents more change
4173910 but mccain and george w bush are not the same kind of republican
4173911 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4173912 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
4173913 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4173914 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
4173915 how many military units u can set up to defend civilians and peacekeepers
4173916 this is not 1968 where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4173917 our troops are doing this their troops are doing that
4173918 this is exactly the reason we need someone like john mccain in the white house
4173919 it almost seems like bush is trying to start another war
4173920 countries in the 21st century respect the sovereignty of other countries
4173921 president saakashvili of georgia seized on the announcement to say that tbilisi airport and poti port would be placed under us military control a claim the pentagon swiftly denied
4173922 the cease fire is a sham and eu memberstates which have signed oil gas delivery contracts with russia dont want to take a stance freedom amp democracy bartered for dubious contracts
4173923 all the decisoin makers are away great moment attack small country
4173924 choose russia as she is today or the soviet union as it was 30 years ago
4173925 russia should not be trusted its history speaks too loud
4173926 why americans always think that their decision is always right and the others would have to obey their wills even some of them are obviously wrong like in this incident to be continued as out from msg size
4173927 wall street and financial services firms are more and more looking at saas from the crm side of the fence
4173928 in the risk and compliance space weve seen an uptick in vendors offering hosted applications and in financial services firms willing to use such services
4173929 theres a fit for saas because its modular its repetitive and it takes significant intellectual capital to build yet it is not something companies want to waste a lot of money on
4173930 the deployment of client software itself forgetting everything else is very traumatic on top of that these firms have a difficult time developing these massive programs so going to saas providers is efficacious

4173961 means more than just a correction from an unusually strong first quarter
4173962 recent leading indicators have all pointed to a sharp slowdown in the second half manufacturing output has slowed sharply in recent months indicating that the prolonged period in which the german industry appeared to be immune against the toxic mix of global slowdown strong currency and very high germanys most important trading partner countries we think recession is now also possible in germany

4173967 the vertebrae cover artwork ultimately visualizes the lyrical concept of this album you have the vertebrae in the centre of the picture symbolizing the humanitys potential strength and at the same time it is stripped and thus also fragile the veins that makes the rune shape makes the connection between the mind and the flesh the actual composition of the artwork is a continuation of our cooperation with the wonderful and talented artist truls espedal we once again managed to get a thousand ideas visualized in one brilliant piece this time we have also added some colour to the usual bleakness making it both more beautiful and dangerous
4173968 enslaved have established themselves amongst the leaders of progressive experimental metal bands with the masterpieces isa and ruun their new album vertebrae stands nothing short of their previous on the contrary vertebrae is a travel through the history of the band looking both back to the roots of grim black metal and into the future of progressive melancholy ala tool and pink floyd mixed by joe baressi tool and mastered by george marino led zeppelin metallica the album sounds nothing less than amazing
4173969 there were several drivers behind this latest release including significant client input our continued mission to improve software interfaces and ease of use and a focus on delivering technology that provides an obvious return on investment

4173988 ive got more than 1 200 items and its anything that i find a bit peculiar rather than something that would have been successful or other people would collect i dont collect sewing machines or typewriters
4173989 its things that perhaps nobody else would be bothered with but in some way helped normal people with their lives like the self pouring teapot or the dynamo torch
4173990 a lot of the items could still be produced today even the self pouring teapot
4173991 why would you want to do that why not just blow on it and it displaces half your coffee
4173992 britain was a phenomenal nation of inventors but things have changed
4173993 nowadays its got to be manufactured abroad and the system of selling has become quite difficult i think 1851 to 1951 was the golden age
4173994 inventors are all quite vulnerable and naive at the beginning we really need advice so its great to have somewhere to go
4173995 you have to be pretty determined and it helps if you have some basic skills

4174001 comprise similar components used in overlapping ranges of concentrations as those claimed
4174002 it would have been prima facie obvious to optimize the viscosity range of the known compositions by routine experimentation
4174003 compositions disclosed by evans inherently possess the same viscosity as the instantly claimed invention
4174004 evans compositions comprise similar component s used in overlapping ranges of concentrations
4174005 inherency may not be established by probabilities or possibilities the mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient
4174006 t he examiner must provide some evidence or scientific reasoning to establish the reasonableness of the examiners belief that the functional limitation is an inherent characteristic of the prior art
4174007 the discovery of an optimum value of a variable in a known process is normally obvious
4174008 composed of several elements is not proved obvious merely by demonstrating that each of its elements was independently known in the prior art
4174009 in order to determine whether there was an apparent reason to combine the known elements in the fashion claimed
4174010 it can be important to identify a reason that would have prompted a person of ordinary skill in the relevant field to combine the prior art elements in the way the claimed new invention does
4174011 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
4174012 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
4174013 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate

4174031 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage
4174032 however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear

4174108 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4174109 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans

4174113 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4174114 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie

4174184 but when you confessed to me everything came rushing back ive never had a problem with gays its just that i was unsure about myself ive been thinking over various things like our jobs our future stuff along those lines but i realised that those things were irrelevant it was just about us i dont know if what i feel for you is more than friendship im sorry

4174186 ill be your girlfriend for one week after that ill give you my answer is that okay
4174187 the fda has reviewed the trial results and the analysis and has validated both
4174188 while this may be an interesting statistical debate it has no bearing on the performance

4174196 we appreciate the frustration of viewers its a minority who have been affected by these enhancements
4174197 dmol the company that runs the engineering behind freeview completed the technical changes for the uk last week and to date weve received a total of 1 200 calls
4174198 the boxes affected were manufactured four to five years ago and together with the manufacturers were doing all we can to help viewers find the best value replacement
4174199 freeview says around 1 of boxes 230 000 sold since 2002 are affected
4174200 we both work nights and weve come home at midnight to find we had no freeview to watch at that time of night which we depend on quite often
4174201 the old one was about 40 three or four years ago
4174202 we were really quite annoyed the first thing we knew about it was today
4174203 no one said anything at all about changing the transmission or anything
4174204 so we thought that the box had suddenly stopped working
4174205 it wasnt until my wife was speaking to friends at work that two or three others had the same problem and someone said that theyd switched something over with the transmitter and certain boxes werent going to work anymore
4174206 it seems the majority of the older models were no longer being used or had been replaced
4174207 having said that we have done everything we can to help those people who have been affected
4174208 thanks for relying me i am so bored that nobody wanna say hi to me

4174211 individuals with adult adhd are twice as likely to use substances twice as likely to smoke cigarettes more likely to be unemployed or underemployed also more likely to be divorced or separated
4174212 on the average adhd adults had 22 days of time out of role per year the out of role corresponds to time that you are not doing your responsibilities
4174213 i got rid of the post it notes and i have a big white board that kind of helps me to keep everything organized
4174214 to make these kind of comments against a group of people who are so loving and so caring i was very very offended by that
4174215 we need to go together forward not by spreading hate but by understanding and building bridges
4174216 this culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom

4174223 the issue of race is there in political campaigns and not just this one people talk in code it is the 800 pound gorilla in the room that is ignored by mutual agreement so it never gets dealt with head on
4174224 it is very difficult to have a frank conversation about race even when you tiptoe around the periphery it can degenerate into a shouting match
4174225 blacks feel like they have more responsibility for exposing and discussing racism whites generally feel that they dont want to be involved
4174226 the code is used to remind people that the opponent is black one of the reasons why people talk about it in muted terms is because its an old racial taboo particularly in the south
4174227 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
4174228 this has become an increasingly difficult and complex job as more imports from more nations are now sold in the united states than ever before

4174230 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4174231 the crew realizes how much he has suffered for us theres no way this movie would have ever been finished without his involvement when people want to see giant fighting robots on screen battling for the future of their planet and ours that cannot be done without shia labeouf
4174232 let me ask you this would you go see this movie for the intense special effects robot cgi and transforming action no of course you wouldnt people only go to see the transformers movies for shia not for the robots robots are fucking gay as shit shia is the real draw here not optimus past his prime or megacock
4174233 the person who submits his interpretation to the judgment of the magisterium of the church must of course interpret the words in the magisteriums judgment but being under the authority of the magisterium means that if necessary he submits even his interpretation of the magisteriums judgment to the magisterium
4174234 act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law
4174235 but if some people have more interpretive authority than others then on what grounds do they have more ecclesial interpretive authority if the answer is that their interpretation of scripture agrees with ones own interpretation of scripture then again the illusion of authority is exposed
4174236 how could burning of houses or destruction of properties be committed right before the very eyes of supposed government law enforcement entities why is it that if the victims of crimes injustices and human rights violations are muslims then the government law enforcers could do nothing practically even given the fact that the commission of such atrocities is unfolding right before their very eyes
4174237 we hope that dilg secretary ronaldo puno national defense secretary gilberto teodoro and vice governor manny pi ol will not condone this alleged crime committed by people under their authority
4174238 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
4174239 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4174250 el ejecutivo envi un proyecto en sinton a con muchos pa ses que apoyan el transporte p blico en momentos de alzas hist ricas de los combustibles en el mundo y ha comprendido que se requiere una pol tica nacional de subsidio al transporte
4174251 se rompi la ortodoxia centralista y se logra contener y rebajar entre un 10 y un 20 la tarifa para regiones
4174252 con esta ley se transparenta el financiamiento del sistema de transporte se acaba el by pass v a pr stamos de dudosa recuperabilidad y se reinstala el poder legislativo como el espacio para buscar acuerdos
4174253 el gobierno tiene la obligaci n de sincerar que la tarifa de 380 no puede seguir congelado y se iniciar un aumento gradual
4174254 una cosa es el aporte nacional que conlleva el proyecto y otra cosa es la p sima gesti n con que se pens implement y proyect el transantiago en la regi n metropolitana
4174255 en los pa ses desarrollados hay pol ticas nacionales de subsidios pero cada regi n y zona metropolitana maneja su sistema de transporte

4174258 with the bases loaded and no outs we may score eight or we may score three but everything you take into the next game is important
4174259 im not good at waiting and neither are my guys but im glad they called it when they did

4174263 in teen titans clock king pushed his terror titans trying to get them to capture the entire teen titans team so that he could sell the heroes to the dark side club a sort of underground fight club run by people who believe theyre the avatars of the new gods
4174264 in terror titans clock king has taken up a more active role in the dark side club and has brought his team of teen legacy villains along for the ride
4174265 he plans to further push and test his team and he also has plans for ravager who left the teen titans at the end of 60
4174266 its about destruction both for destructions sake as well as for the purpose of rebuilding and its also about a whole lot of young metahumans beating the crap out of each other
4174267 joe bennett said hed only draw the title if there was lots of blood and i think ive accommodated him pretty well so far
4174268 theres far more moral ambiguity to deal with and i also just really enjoy writing people who are capable of terrible things
4174269 we wont be tying in directly but the aftereffects of this story will immediately be felt in teen titans we will also bring the dark side club concept from seven soldiers and final crisis into its next evolutionary step and thats the central locale for the story but no one needs to have read any of that nor even the terror titans arc in teen titans to get whats going on here
4174270 hes unpredictable hes manipulative and he clearly has a lot of secrets he lives in a state of perpetual precognition making him damn near impossible to surprise
4174271 he lives in a dimension where time intersects but doesnt age anything so he could be very very old for all we know all this adds together to make a highly intelligent immensely powerful and thoroughly insane character
4174272 i wouldnt call rose a villain she marches to the beat of her own drum sometimes that beat puts her on the side of the angels and other times it turns her into a hardened killer
4174273 sure as readers will learn from the outset rose is pretty clear about why shes come to the dark side club its to do with her own precognition and how it seems to resonate with clock kings
4174274 dont expect her to play nice with the terror titans nor anyone else for that matter
4174275 at the start of 2 5 the readers will get to see the origin story of each character and give you more of a sense of who they are and why theyre part of this band of sociopathic killers
4174276 joe brings energy amazing emotion and wonderful clarity in his layouts
4174277 hes also breaking down a lot of the fight scenes himself per his request so were doing certain pages plot style where ill describe the action and hell decide how he wants to display it it makes a lot of sense since id probably only hamper him visually
4174278 the teen titans will be gaining a few new members in the months to come but that will happen in teen titans itself
4174279 of course it wouldnt be a shock to anyone if at least one character in this miniseries winds up signing up at titans tower
4174280 were roughed out through june 2009 right now so lets see theyre will be new and old and downright ancient theyre will be red and blue and green theyre will be changes and upgrades and enemies and teammates where theyre least expected

4174285 instead of speaking softly and wielding a big stick as teddy roosevelt recommended the american policeman has been loudly lecturing the rest of the world while waving an increasingly unimpressive baton the events of the past few days serve as a reminder that our ideological ambitions have greatly exceeded our military reach particularly in areas like the caucasus which is of only peripheral importance to the united states but is of vital interest to russia
4174286 i looked over and saw a couple people coming in and out of the house i knew they didnt live there so it didnt look right so i went back to my house grabbed my phone and called police
4174287 when i looked in the house one of the other guys had a white t shirt on and he was holding a gun to the lady and the little boys head and hollering at them for them to give him the cash
4174288 i cant wait to find a new house to live in i know that it definitely aint going to be around here

4174298 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4174299 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4174300 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4174301 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4174302 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4174303 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4174304 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
4174305 based on the records that we have it appears that there was no contamination
4174306 looking further into the records we had a permit that was issued
4174307 the worship of animals trees spirits of the dead even stones
4174308 that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
4174309 we are much more worried by georgian imperialism than russian imperialism
4174310 it is closer to us and we feel its pressure all the time
4174311 it was worse than a crime it was a mistake
4174312 instead of speaking softly and wielding a big stick as teddy roosevelt recommended the american policeman has been loudly lecturing the rest of the world while waving an increasingly unimpressive baton the events of the past few days serve as a reminder that our ideological ambitions have greatly exceeded our military reach particularly in areas like the caucasus which is of only peripheral importance to the united states but is of vital interest to russia

4174324 cant say it had any direct influence other than a film that i have watched countless times but only once on screen a midnight show at 8th st playhouse which my best friend and i could only get in by bringing his mom the place was filled with bikers and one next to me yelled out during a scene say it like it is joe word is the band didnt like the film when it came out and the lead ray gange punched out one of the directors after seeing it but i think thats only because it showed too much truth

4174335 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4174336 we would hope that he would be true to his word
4174337 the provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place and that means that military activities have to cease
4174338 the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively in a way that went far beyond reasserting the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia
4174339 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not
4174340 we are just watching the situation there are still snipers out there certain groups have gotten through and the provocations are continuing
4174341 we will settle things with everyone and right now establishing peace is the main issue
4174342 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4174343 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4174344 michigan has a lot of personal history for me and i m always glad to go there
4174345 a little bit of this a little bit of that

4174349 me dwight and carlos boozer people didnt think we could rebound and that wed get beat outside we just have to keep pushing and show how we can get it done
4174350 we believe our ima hybrid system is best suited for smaller vehicles where the fuel efficiency gains are the greatest
4174351 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it and that is our goal for this new hybrid model to make it affordable for a new generation of car buyers
4174352 if you get 35 000 people in the stands in the cfl youre making a profit
4174353 im sure toronto can handle that and two or three games from the nfl
4174354 i think it will be great entertainment for the toronto community and i think everyone wants to see the nfl play because we all watch the games on sunday
4174355 i think it will be great for the city here
4174356 while we have reports that president bush had some kind of conversation with putin at the olympics it is hard to say at what level messages are being delivered to the powers that be in moscow and i think if the u s is going to be effective we have to let the russians know directly that we think this is not acceptable behavior in the 21st century
4174357 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4174358 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4174359 our evidence based study says the test you ordered is not needed so were not paying for it
4174360 those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves
4174361 i freed thousands of slaves i could have freed thousands more if they had known they were slaves
4174362 is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
4174363 a christian man is the most free lord of all and subject to none a christian man is the most dutiful servant of all and subject to every one
4174364 the mccain plan represents bush economics on steroids it has 3 4 trillion more in tax cuts than president bush is proposing largely directed at corporations and the most affluent sen mccain would implement these cuts without proposing any meaningful steps to simplify taxes or eliminate distortions and loopholes in addition sen mccain has floated over 1 trillion in new spending increases but barely any specific spending cuts

4174374 but his great grandparents were from germany so that lineage got the michigan native on the german team
4174375 a member of the german nation in the sense of this law is whoever has in his or her homeland avowed adherence to the german nation to the degree that this avowal is confirmed by definite characteristics such as ancestry language education and culture
4174376 persons of alien blood artfremden blutes in particular jews are never such members of the german nation even if they have hitherto described themselves as such
4174377 for most of the germans from russia russlanddeutschen getting a german great great great grandfather inserted into their family tree was surely only a matter of some rubles
4174378 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4174379 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit
4174380 ahmedinejads visit has symbolical meaning with this visit iran gives the world the message that it is not possible to isolate iran
4174381 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and to the zone of conflict towards south ossetia
4174382 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4174383 i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother dina lohan taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4174384 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4174385 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4174386 i was just focused on doing my best in beijing

4174388 courage demonstrates that both treatment strategies can have a profoundly positive effect on patients health status and suggests complementary roles optimal medical therapy as first line therapy with pci reserved for patients who do not have a response or who have severe baseline symptoms
4174389 you can say to patients you wont be at increased risk if we dont put a stent in that blockage right now
4174390 it is difficult to assert that a pci first strategy should clearly be adopted routinely in patients with stable angina

4174410 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development
4174411 based on what happened in the first half of the year creas market analysis shows a record high national average residential price by the end of 2008 but with a much more modest increase than was recorded in 2007
4174412 however since the declines were mostly in the western cities where prices were not too long ago appreciating at a double digit pace we remain confident that the extent of the slowdown nationally will remain measured
4174413 the company will continue to manage its costs responsibly and improve production efficiencies where possible
4174414 during the second quarter the company reduced production and research and development staff to core levels reduced executive compensation and continues to review supplier alternatives
4174415 selamat datang para petinggi demak bintoro dan para wali agung di padepokan saya desa khendarsawa
4174416 maafkan seandainya andika dipaksa harus turun dari punggung kuda dan berjalan menaiki anak tangga padepokan yang tidak sedikit mungkin langkah andika tersita dan melelahkan
4174417 meski pun kami dipaksa harus berjalan kaki bukanlah soal karena sesulit apa pun menuju padepokan ini akan kami lakukan yang jelas bisa menemui andika
4174418 bukankah setelah kesulitan ada kemudahan mungkin saja bagi andika semua belumlah bisa bertemu kemudahan dengan segera bisa jadi kesulitan yang berikutnya
4174419 people get very emotional as there is a lot of volatility out there so when they see a headline number they hit for a sell button fairly quickly
4174420 some relief may be in the offing given indications that gasoline prices moved lower in august
4174421 however the annual rate of inflation is likely to remain above 5 5 per cent through the third quarter which will likely keep the federal reserve wary thus we expect that the central bank confronted with the dual and offsetting risks of stronger inflation and weaker growth will keep the fed funds unchanged at two per cent through the middle of next year
4174422 based on what happened in the first half of the year creas market analysis shows a record national average residential price by the end of 2008 but with a much more modest increase than was recorded in 2007
4174423 the combination of higher prices and increased gasoline consumption has raised the portion of income consumers allocate to gasoline to 3 8 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 from 2 9 per cent in 2002
4174424 the increase in spending on gasoline since 2002 was offset by the drop in the share of income devoted to purchasing autos from 6 2 per cent to 5 3 per cent the drop for autos entirely reflects lower prices as canadians increased vehicle purchases over the last six years

4174539 the resolution obama voted for would not have increased taxes on any single taxpayer making less than 41 500 per year in total income or any couple making less than 83 000 the 32 000 figure is approximately the taxable income of a single person making 41 500 per year after all deductions and exclusions
4174540 2008 individual income tax rates standard deductions personal exemptions and filing thresholds
4174541 the top two income tax brackets would return to their 1990s levels of 36 and 39 6 including the exemption and deduction phase outs all other brackets would remain as they are today
4174542 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners thats why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 not income taxes capital gains taxes dividend or payroll taxes
4174543 if you are a family making less than 250 000 my plan will not raise your taxes not your income taxes not your payroll taxes not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes
4174544 it is true that those like myself who are in the top 5 percent were going to see a tax increase im going to roll the bush tax cuts back to the levels they were in the 1990s
4174545 including all tax returns that had a positive agi those taxpayers with an agi of 145 283 or more in 2005 constituted the nations top 5 percent of earners
4174546 i have paid for every element of this economic agenda by ending a war thats costing us billions by closing tax loopholes for corporations by putting a price on carbon pollution and by ending george bushs tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of americans
4174547 so i put forward a very specific plan those kinds of progressive tax steps while closing loopholes and rolling back the bush tax cuts to the top 1 percent simply restores some fairness and a sense that were all in this together as opposed to each of us being in it on our own
4174548 if we kept the payroll tax rate exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
4174549 even as barack obama proposes fiscally responsible tax reform to strengthen our economy and restore the balance that has been lost in recent years we hear the familiar protests and distortions from the guardians of the broken status quo many of these very same critics made many of these same overheated predictions in previous elections they said president clintons 1993 deficit reduction plan would wreck the economy now they are making the same claims about sen obamas tax plan which has even lower taxes than prevailed in the 1990s including lower taxes on middle class families lower taxes for capital gains and lower taxes for dividends
4174550 clinton promised not to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his social programs in fact he repeatedly promised a middle class tax cut
4174551 on many issues he insists on having it both ways
4174552 on august 10 1993 pres clinton signed into law the largest tax increase in u s history the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 obra93 is constructed to collect 241 000 000 000 in new taxes on personal income corporations and gasoline over the next five years
4174553 the income tax boost accounts for more than half the revenue raised by the 1993 clinton package two smaller elements accounting for about a fifth of the revenue pinch the middle class the gas tax and a tax boost for social security recipients earning more than 34 000
4174554 obama started his campaign saying his plans would not increase taxes for people earning less than 250 000 but he found himself in an apparent contradiction by saying he would tax all income to fund social security not just income up to 102 000 as is now the case
4174555 so now obamas plan calls for no social security tax on income between 102 000 and 250 000 but all income above 250 000 would be taxed for social security
4174556 prior to june 13 2008 obama had kept open the possibility that he would impose the 12 4 percent social security tax on income as low as 97 500 the annually adjusted ceiling in place in 2007
4174557 while obama has suggested imposing the 12 4 percent tax on all income above 97 000 per year edwards would only impose it on those making more than 200 000 per year income between 97 000 and 200 000 would continue to be exempt from social security taxes under the edwards proposal
4174558 if we kept the payroll tax rate exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
4174559 under current law income up to 102 000 a year is taxed for social security obama would create a doughnut hole by not imposing new social security taxes on income between 102 000 and 250 000 his aides said income exceeding 250 000 would be taxed at a rate of 2 percent to 4 percent rather than the 6 percent tax that people pay toward social security on income below the 102 000 cutoff which is matched by their employers paying a 6 percent tax employers would probably pay an additional tax but the total tax paid by both employee and employer would not exceed 4 percent of the amount of income earned over 250 000
4174560 if you are a family making less than 250 000 my plan will not raise your taxes not your income taxes not your payroll taxes not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes
4174561 in terms of capital gains ive suggested we might go back up to 20 percent because
4174562 well what ive said is i certainly would not raise it higher than it was under ronald reagan but the fact is that im mindful that weve got to keep our capital gains tax to a point where we can actually get more revenue but thats not something thats going to affect the average person with a 401 k when people start talking about how well there are you know millions of americans who own stock most of them own stock in 401 k s where their taxes are deferred and they pay ordinary income taxes when they finally cash out
4174563 individual income and tax data by state and size of adjusted gross income tax year 2006
4174564 how do you plan to change the tax code when it comes to capital gains how high will that 15 percent rate go
4174565 well you know i havent given a firm number heres my belief that we cant go back to some of the you know confiscatory rates that existed in the past that distorted sound economics and i certainly would not go above what existed under bill clinton which was the 28 percent
4174566 the top capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 would return to 20 the lowest rate that existed in the 1990s and the rate president bush proposed in his 2001 tax cut

4174588 casino revenues for the three months ended june 30 2008 increased 345
4174589 i spoke for thirty minutes and what formally i had felt in my mind without knowing it somehow was now proved by reality
4174590 each of us turned to his circle of friends in order to move the one or the other to visit one of these meetings the success was a miserable one i still remember how in the first period i myself once carried out about eighty of these bills and how in the evening we waited for the masses of the people that were to come with one hours delay the chairman had finally to open the meeting we were again seven men the old seven
4174591 who was then chairman of the local group of munich was a simple workman as a speaker equally little important and for the rest he was not a soldier he had not served with the army also during the war he was not a soldier so that he whose entire nature was weak and uncertain lacked the only school which made it possible to turn uncertain and weak characters into men
4174592 the reds in the year 1920 in many parts of germany a national meeting that dared to direct an appeal to the great masses and to extend an invitation publicly to visit it was simply impossible the participants at such a meeting were dispersed and driven away with bleeding heads the mere name german workers party had an irritating effect terror is not broken by power of mind but by terror subject brest litovsk and versailles four gentlemen appeared as speakers i myself spoke for almost an hour and the success was greater than on the occasion of the first demonstration an attempted disturbance was at once nipped in the bud by my comrades the disturbing individuals were thrown downstairs with their heads knocked about
4174593 on the whole the entire winter of 1919 20 was one single fight to strengthen the faith in the victorious power of the young movement and to increase it to that fanaticism which then in the form of faith is able to move mountains
4174594 but a man who in this world does not succeed in being hated by his adversaries seems to me of little value as a friend
4174595 but it makes no impression whatsoever on such a quack that in a peoples assembly a demosthenes can be silenced if only fifty idiots supported by their talk and their fists wont let him speak
4174596 a man who knows a thing who realizes a given danger and who sees with his eyes the possibility of a remedy has the damned duty and obligation to work not in silence but to stand up publicly against the evil and for its remedy
4174597 propaganda influence on the great masses concentration on a few points continuous repetition of the latter self assured and confident wording of the texts in the form of apodictic assertion greatest persistency in spreading and patience in awaiting the effect
4174598 at 7 30 the opening was to take place at 7 15 i entered the banquet hall of the hofbrauhaus at the platzl in munich and my heart nearly burst with joy the enormous room for then it appeared to me like that was overfilled with people shoulder to shoulder a mass numbering almost two thousand and above all those people had come to whom we wished to appeal far more than half of the hall seemed to be taken by communists and independents after the first speaker had finished i took up the word a few minutes later interrupting shouts came down like showers of hail violent clashes occurred in the hall and a handful of the most faithful war comrades and other adherents were struggling with the disturbers and only by and by were they able to restore peace i was able to continue after half an hour applause gradually began to drown out the shouting and calling when after almost four hours the hall began to empty and the crowd shoulder to shoulder like a slow stream began to push to scramble and pour towards the exit then i knew that now the principles of a movement which never could be forgotten walked out into the german people a fire had been lighted and out of its flames there was bound to come some day the sword which was to regain the freedom of the germanic siegfried and the life of the german nation and side by side with the coming rise i sensed that there walked the goddess of inexorable revenge for the perjured act of the 9 of november 1918
4174599 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
4174600 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
4174601 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
4174602 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
4174603 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
4174604 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
4174605 in my eyes there were all cruel ugly inside but i think that mahmoud zahar one of the leaders of hamas in gaza is one of the worst
4174606 people with an open mind i liked to walk around among the buildings the restaurants the people to feel the night life i have many friends there whom i would like to see and i dont know whether ill be able to do that at all i mainly miss my mother my brothers and sisters but i know that it will be very difficult for me to return to ramallah soon
4174607 its those really easy words we learned before we could speak that are so rich and complicated these days words like time love mother father i talked to kids about big words and they had different ideas about them
4174608 if you or someone you know is thinking about adding a pet to your family i urge you to check the internet
4174609 heck yeah you can have hampsters if it only costs me 5 and there is virtually no maintenance involved
4174610 hurumph of course i own the road my taxes pay for them i pay for the roads and ill use em
4174611 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
4174612 for a former soccer player its difficult to do this off a monitor
4174613 you cant see plays developing you want to be where everyone is screaming
4174614 the natural sounds makes you feel like youre there and the pictures are great
4174615 if youre not there you have a different focus at the stadium youre seeing different things things your audience cant see
4174616 you couldnt feel the intent of the player who got it
4174617 but in terms of seeing the game and getting replays its just as well that were here but you do miss a lot of atmosphere
4174618 subtle game within a game elements were not seeing i instinctively hit the talk back button a few times to ask to see some pitches but we dont have any control of that
4174619 it seems like only yesterday that joone was photographing her this release is the start to a fabulous superstar career for riley she has a ton of natural talent and with amazing stars like shay jordan around to help guide her the sky is the limit
4174620 but this is the first movie ive had come out and ive been bouncing around since digital playground first told me when it would happen
4174621 anytime i get to shoot with erik is really exciting
4174622 we always have a great time and hes such a great performer
4174623 ive wanted boobs since i was in elementary school so no one was going to stop me
4174624 the power is strong ive never seen a burn so severe forgive me mary i had no idea
4174625 mary you are to stay by me at all times
4174626 no objections chris you are not to come within five feet of her got it
4174627 are you sure you should let her play with that
4174628 are you sure you want me to have this i gave it to you
4174629 i like my gun thank you the blade fits better in your hands you will need it if zenaku does come for mary are you sure you can hold your own against his coven
4174630 mary our fangs are second to the strength of a diamond the sharp part of the blade is made only of fangs the rest is made of the remaining teeth every part of the blade is teeth even the sheath
4174631 im worried i know youre abilities chris but if zenaku really wants mary hell get her
4174632 no actually all i know is zenaku and his four wives
4174633 do you know what those four females are capable of
4174634 fiona has visions like darien but hers are a lot weaker
4174635 her younger sister bre is also a wife bre has the ability to enhance any vampires special skill to double its original strength even with bre at fionas side dariens visions are still stronger
4174636 she has the ability to pull out a world map and pinpoint the exact location of any vampire just as long as she has a picture she can find zenakus target the last wife the head wife is diana she can control electricity
4174637 you never used to care about the other covens just as long as yours was left alone you didnt care about anything
4174638 things change when the members of your family are being threatened
4174639 mary we should head back when the sun lowers you seem fine when the sun is about to set why not sleep while me and your father hunt i need to gather payment for dehein
4174640 i doubt your father would want you to tag along
4174641 you really know how to ruin a moment do you have any idea where some of our enemies could be
4174642 they have been sticking to the boarder of the village
4174643 stay here mary kamigishi is pretty good at sensing danger
4174644 her thoughts wont be needed if she is in danger
4174645 i can feel when shes in trouble trust me instinct just like i said
4174646 we will return soon get some rest i have your song folders on your desk maybe they can help you with your voice

4174659 try and stay calm i will come for you when i know it is safe
4174660 tell me everything i have had much time to think this past month sense you last left me please tell me about mary
4174661 i hear he has be killed but his own coven
4174662 he disobeyed the order that was given to him zenaku had sent him here on a mission to turn one of the females that resides here once he had done that he was to bring her back to his coven instead he turned the female and made her his mate
4174663 good think you came to the old warehouse when you did one of the hermits found her and brought her to where ken found her ken then brought her to us
4174664 is this before or after you came to see me
4174665 she was safe with darien when i came to see you
4174666 i thought your wounds healed faster if you are well fed
4174667 garith took her voice and zenaku had him murdered before we had a chance to get it back she can speak to me though
4174668 we do not know whats so appealing about her voice we can not hear her therefore we can not say
4174669 if he wants her voice so badly then why did he kill garith
4174670 dehein said he offers money and a place in his coven
4174671 what a prize that must be the reason for the increase in vampires in this area their all looking for her
4174672 they are in my territory and it is my right especially if they are after my family

4174707 meanwhile anyone know about mccains drinking habits because its hard to believe he said this while he was stone cold sober the irony of that statement surely wont be lost to any but the most deluded observers
4174708 it was the type of foreign policy rhetorical blunder that has regularly plagued the mccain campaign and could have diplomatic ripples as well certainly the comment was meant in innocence but for those predisposed to the notion that the u s is an increasingly arrogant international actor the suggestion by a presidential candidate that in this day and age countries dont invade one another when the u s is occupying two foreign nations does little to alleviate that negative perception
4174709 you hear that george bush mccains coming for you nations dont inv what he supported the surge hey every rule has its exception right
4174710 to his increasing embarrassment while trying to justify his foreign policy adventurism to reporters john mccain made a rather startling pronouncement as so often mccain was taking his cue from his other inept ally george bush so does that pronouncement disqualify mccain for the presidency or just disqualify him to speak about his own policy toward iraq
4174711 of course the lefties have jumped all over this perhaps what mccain meant to say was that nations dont invade other nations unless in response to an invasion of a third country and then after thirteen years of broken promises a nation may invade another nation under the auspices of several standing un resolutions but that probably would have taken too long to say
4174712 at a press conference just now john mccain redoubled his efforts to thrust himself into a leadership role on the russia georgia crisis front announcing that two top campaign surrogates joe lieberman and lindsey graham are going on a visit to georgia mccain said
4174713 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
4174714 lieberman and graham of course are key campaign allies of mccain the arizona senator has been using obamas absence on vacation to associate himself more directly with the russia georgia war in the mind of the public mccains announcement of his key campaign allies trip abroad also seems designed to shoulder bush aside as the primary gop leadership figure here
4174715 i think greg sargent is on to something yes theyre both members of the armed services committee but mccains declaration has something of a shadow government feel to it as though hes sending his own emissaries into the war zone
4174716 and is this really a good time for mccain to be sending his own delegation to tbilisi isnt that a trifle presumptuous what happened to one president at a time
4174717 it seems that mccain thinks hes already president of the united states and is sending his own delegation to georgia consisting of senator lindsey graham and senator joe lieberman why not
4174718 try to imagine the response if obama dispatched two of his top campaign surrogates to georgia to review conditions on the ground there would be apoplexy how dare a presumptive nominee act like hes already president but that is effectively what were seeing here mccain is on the phone with saakashvili on a daily basis occasionally multiple times throughout the day having international discussions of an unknown nature
4174719 i realize its a delicate situation but other than moving evan bayh to the top of the vp list in response and potentially handing a senate seat to the republicans wheres obama
4174720 this is a very smart move by john mccain politically because from the second news came out about russia attacking georgia he has been in front of the situation leading the way on statements he called it right while obama equated the victim with the aggressor by calling for restraint from georgia and russia then obama had to modify his position to sound more like mccain did the first time around mccain led bush even by coming out with just the right statements each day staying in contact with saakashvili each day and keeping on top of the information and situation mccain has shown leadership while obama has been on vacation now the timing of russias actions cannot be laid at obamas feet it was coincidental that russia chose that moment to attack but it certainly hasnt done obama any good in the eyes of the public to have john mccain leading the way very presidentially
4174721 a sour note in an otherwise strong statement proposing harsh consequences for russias aggression from booting them out of the g8 to rejecting their membership in the wto to sending peacekeepers to their new sudetenland in ossetia and abkhazia hes careful to say that liebs and graham will be going in their capacity as senators and members of the armed services committee and invites other members to go with them but given the context and the fact that theyre his two most ardent supporters it comes off like hes dispatching them as envoys questions that pop to mind do committee members really need to conduct their own fact finding missions in the middle of a hot war state and defense briefings could probably get them up to speed and what would the reaction have been if the one had made this move first with bayh and webb in the surrogate roles would have seemed to me like a transparent attempt to squeeze a photo op from a crisis that the administrations already straining to manage without needing any extra distractions well here you go
4174722 hes despatching lindsey and joe as emissaries to the country immediately hes on the phone with sakashvilli daily hes giving press conferences hes warning of a new tsarist empire you can tell what sends him into high energy zones a clear enemy abroad he knows black and white and he knows war it gives him clarity and strength up next iran and china oh the conflicts we can have if this is the dynamic you want to see in the next president mccain is your man
4174723 the mccain campaigns neocon grandstanding and effective u s foreign policy takeover is being driven by mccains combined foreign policy adviser and lobbyist for georgian president saakashvili randy scheunemann check bio in yesterdays photo aboard mccains plane we see scheunemann and lieberman jawboning with mccain seated behind obviously the major prop here is the map of georgia as much as mccain accuses russia of having grand designs what the map most calls into relief with obama on vacation graham and lieberman packing for georgia and scheunemann dangling the paper in the aisle for the cameras is how mccain is milking the crisis for all its worth
4174724 its hard to believe well not too hard that foreign governments hire top mccain staffers and part of the deal is that mccain beats the war drums for them is this even legal
4174725 scheunemann is a registered lobbyist for a foreign agent embroiled in a conflict with the russians mccain has rushed to georgias side telling the country that we are all georgians his top foreign policy advisor is being paid by them can you say conflict of interest scheunemann is a c level neocon and georgia is a c level neocon entity but the fact that this war has burst to the surface not only gives the appearance of impropriety it damages our foreign policy you cant tell me that this isnt very harmful so mccains freelancing is putting pressure on the bush administration to act by attacking the russians or something just as foolhardy and theres a foreign lobbyist right in the middle of all this scheunemann should clearly be fired its bigger than scheunemann its about the culture of washington that permits this gross conflict of interest think progress has more on how scheunemann likely orchestrated mccains nomination of saakashvili for the nobel prize for his own financial gain this is unbelievable
4174726 the white house has started to panic over a july 9 meeting between condi rice and mikheil saakashvili desperate to suggest they didnt encourage georgias crack down in south ossetia given that panic i wonder whether karl rove had any similar chats with saakashvili when they were in yalta together just days later now theres been a lot of justified chatter about the role of randy scheunemann who appears to be advising the republic of georgia at the same time as he provides campaign advice to john mccain theres something going on and given karl roves presence close to the scene of the crime ive got my suspicions
4174727 the bushies insist they knew nothing about what the georgians were planning condi rice phoned it in despite the fact that shes a russia specialist who met with saakashvilli on july 9 and karl rove was suspiciously in the area with saakishvilli shortly thereafter throw in mccains lobbyist ties to georgia and youve got quite a constellation of events that just happened to play to mccains perceived strengths
4174728 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that colin powell will endorse obama he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
4174729 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
4174730 once again colin powell is in the spotlight and continuing his role as one of the most respected and also discounted political rock stars in the nation republicans love him when he is toeing the party line democrats love him when he seems to be bucking the party and administration line republicans discount his importance when he doesnt hold the party line democrats say he was a lousy secretary of state when he isnt breaking with the party line both candidates clearly want powells endorsement even though supporters of each candidate will diss powell if they think hes leaning towards the other one to mccain a powell endorsement would signal to crucial independent swing voters that he indeed is still the maverick who isnt a cookie cutter establishment republican most important it would also signal that military man powell would feel and perhaps sleep better with military man mccain at the oval office helm to obama a powell endorsement would be a huge get it would signal to independent voters that obama is truly someone who can reach across the aisle and is not the stereotypical democrat it would also signal that military man powell would feel comfortable with non military man obama at the oval office helm it would also be interpreted by some as powell giving a finger in the eye to the bush administration for the way he was treated and the damage serving it did to his reputation in some circles in fact if powell endorses obama gopers will likely suggest its because he is the equivalent of a disgruntled administration employee prediction its unlikely powell will sit this one out if only because both sides will be clamoring and pressuring through their associates to get powell to endorse them and hell be under pressure not to do something that will favor one side until he endorses and then hell be the target of demeaning comments from the side of whatever candidate he didnt endorse the same folks who are clamoring for his endorsement now
4174731 if accurate this is huge and great news for obama powell even contributed to mccain at the beginning of the race if i believed in truly devious motives i would speculate that someone leaked this in order to scuttle whatever discussions were going on between the obama camp and powell
4174732 honestly i think it could swing a significant number of independents to either candidates favor after all powell is one of the more popular moderate political figures weve encountered in the past couple decades even with that infamous speech at the u n looming in the background my guess i think he would have come out for mccain a lot earlier if he was going to support john so i think hes leaning heavily towards obama because he shares a similar approach to foreign policy with the illinois senator that doesnt mean hell explicitly endorse obama but powells silence would be telling in a year like this especially consider he has been a lifelong republican albeit a moderate one
4174733 is there any political figure in america whose endorsement would mean more to barry o impeccable military credentials reformed bush cabinet member harbinger of the very sort of post racial crossover appeal the one is desperately seeking and a spectacular counter to liebermans own imminent zell miller ish turn at the republican convention
4174734 its true that the obama campaign is trying to line up some high profile republicans but i do not think powell will be one of them
4174735 i wouldnt be so sure about the powell endorsement rumors im with ambers on this its too ballsy a move for powell im also inherently suspicious of kristols motives if powell were considering such an endorsement kristol would do all he can to derail it prematurely leaking it creating a fire storm and forcing powell to deny is one way to pre empt such a move its vital for the neocons to prevent obama gaining traction with serious foreign policy machers but it makes sense in one obvious way powell understands how deep a hole the us is in internationally and how only obama truly has a chance to get the country back on its feet its the impulse of a patriot and maybe the smears have made him mad
4174736 this is in some ways interesting and in some ways to be expected it is interesting because you might have assumed that powell a military guy and a republican who also happens to be a political donor to mccain might stick with him so why do this you can certainly understand why powell would be tempted to support the first african american candidate with a legitimate shot at the presidency but aside from race i think there is another similarity between powell and obama the less you know about their political views the more you like them frankly had he wanted to powell could have probably been elected president as a republican if he simply refused to say anything a cynical view for this move for this move of course is that powell clearly cares about his legacy and this is his way perhaps of redeeming himself to the media and insiders
4174737 more broadly its fascinating that two of mccains allies and fellow vietnam vets chuck hagel and colin powell are remaining on the sidelines both it seems respect mccain too much to dishonor him by appearing at his opponents convention as hagels office announced yesterday but both also are concerned enough about the bush administration the war and perhaps mccains ties to the two that they also have yet to get behind their friend
4174738 for what its worth kristol is about as far from a straight ahead reporter as they come and just about everything he writes comes from a partisan republican perspective whats more powells spokesman is emphatically denying that powell will be at either partys convention in the coming weeks
4174739 given his track record on everything else cough iraq war cough im sure this info is solid and you can take this prediction to the bank
4174740 caution note that the kristol ball has a mixed record
4174741 so what is bill kristol up to i have a hunch but its completely speculative since steve schmidt was given the operative reins of the mccain campaign schmidt has been pushing hard for flamboyant dramatic showdowns to contrast mccain from obama he helped orchestrate the ongoing political theater on oil drilling and schmidt and his team have grabbed the russia georgia conflict and tried to ratchet higher us russian tension rather than stand down again to differentiate the mccain camp from what they hope is perceived as a more dovish obama position my hunch is that bill kristol and friends dont want interest calculating negotiators and balanced sensible pragmatic realists around mccain they are perhaps using the russia conflict to purge their foreign policy team of those who are not neocon or neocon friendly and by trying to export colin powell to obama kristol is really going after his close friend and ally richard armitage while at the same time attacking general powells utility to obama and who is helping steve schmidt and bill kristol orchestrate this purge and exploit this european crisis i think colin powells old white house nemesis karl rove just a hunch but mccains team is working on achieving national security clarity of the neoconservative kind

4174975 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
4174976 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes

4175001 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4175002 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4175003 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4175004 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4175005 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4175006 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4175007 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4175008 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4175009 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts
4175010 its not the marijuana thats dangerous for me its the chocolate to which i could easily become addicted again
4175011 i had been with john for about three years he was a really nice guy and i enjoyed being with him but there wasnt a ton of passion most everyone we knew had gotten engaged and though john would have proposed in a second whenever he brought it up id change the subject i took a trip to australia for work and while i was gone i got together with a co worker to whom id always been insanely attracted i had a fantastic trip probably because for the first time in a long time i experienced that excitement id been missing i broke up with john soon after i returned home and began dating the guy from the trip even though im not super proud of my actions things ended up for the best after dating for a few years the guy from the trip and i got married and were incredibly happy together
4175012 right before i was going to break up with my ex sean he found out that he had to put his beloved dog to sleep he was so broken up about it that i didnt have the heart to end things so i waited a month or so until he was in better shape when things seemed to be better and i was ready he lost his job so i felt like i was back to square one by that time i had met someone else that i really wanted to start seeing so i went ahead and did it i eventually ended things never telling sean about my extra curricular dating i think i rationalized that i was trying to spare his feelings
4175013 my boyfriend greg and i decided to do the long distance thing after i was accepted to a graduate program 200 miles from where we lived the first few months were fine but i soon found myself becoming extremely attracted to my lab partner henry what began as innocent flirting eventually wound up with us in bed after the program was over i returned home to greg being with him was really difficult but i didnt break up with him initially because i was still attracted to him too i visited henry a few times and realized that he was really more of a fling probably born out of boredom and that greg was the one for me i eventually stopped communicating with henry i never told greg about what happened which occasionally makes me feel guilty but i chalk my cheating up to being young and silly he and i are still together four years since my program ended
4175014 i began dating eric shortly after i had been dumped by dave my boyfriend of two years i was devastated and eric was definitely a rebound thing after eric and i had dated for five months dave came back and wanted to give things another shot i still really missed him so i began seeing him but never ended things with eric i think i sort of kept eric around for insurance purposes just in case things didnt end up well with dave dave and i didnt make it on round two and after eric discovered through mutual friends that i had been seeing him again he ended things with me i definitely learned my lesson about dating two guys at the same time not to mention trying to rekindle a relationship thats just plain over
4175015 when i was younger i dated a guy named ethan who was really critical of me he constantly made little snide comments about my weight how stupid i was and how clumsy i was for whatever odd reason i was into him despite the fact that all of my friends and family hated him one weekend when he was away i met will at a party and we completely hit it off he was the complete opposite of ethan kind sweet and generous yet completely cool and fun too we hung out all weekend and it was like a light bulb went off in my head this is how mature relationship worthy guys act i hooked up with will the night before he left and broke up with ethan soon after will and i dated for three years and now were married
4175016 im from florida so i adore going to the beach and boating but my former boyfriend chris a total city boy hated it we always argued about where wed take trips and he always won about eight months into our dating i took a trip to key west with my friends and we chartered a boat for the day the captain of the boat was this totally hot complete beach guy for life type and i spent the whole day flirting with him we met him out that night and he and i got together i never told chris about it after i got home and i never felt guilty i think part of me felt like thats what chris got for being so stubborn chris and i didnt make it and after we broke up i made sure any future boyfriends loved the beach
4175017 my last boyfriend was a total player before we got together i thought i could change him but i was wrong i always heard rumors that he was hooking up with other girls while we were dating but he always denied it one night i got a call from a girl he had been seeing and she detailed their three month long relationship to me and told me about another girl she had discovered he was seeing as well i was so mad that i went out with my friends that night dressed to kill and went home with the hottest guy i could find i felt like it was the least he deserved i loved seeing the look on his face when i told him about what i did and that i knew about the other girls and then i dumped him
4175018 my ex was a terrible kisser the worst i really liked everything else about him but whenever it came time to get physical i just cringed one night when i was at a party without him a bunch of people started this old school yet fairly intense game of spin the bottle and i felt like i had to join as i hadnt had a decent kiss in a long time i probably kissed about 10 guys that night all of whom were so much better than my ex i ended things pretty quickly after that experience which made me realize that the physical part of a relationship is truly important
4175019 its a dangerous situation a crowded pit lane a lot going on
4175020 you dont like to see that kind of thing but its not danicas fault stuff happens racing is dangerous were very concerned and hopefully it will turn out good
4175021 he was just walking down pit road to go back to the garage to get some stuff

4175030 christianity has caused more wars and death than anything else
4175031 it can not be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists but by christians not on religions but on the gospel of jesus christ
4175032 the principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of christianity
4175033 my object in life is to dethrone god and destroy capitalism
4175034 the conception of law will have to be freed from every remnant of transcendence and absoluteness practically from all moralist fanaticism
4175035 when one gives up the christian faith one pulls the right to christian morality our from under ones feet this morality is by no means self evident christianity is a system a whole view of things thought out together by breaking one concept out of it the faith in god one breaks the whole nothing necessary remains in ones hands
4175036 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within
4175037 there is no god and no soul hence there are no needs for the props of traditional religion with dogma and creed excluded then immutable truth is also dead and buried there is no room for fixed natural law or permanent absolutes
4175038 education is thus a most powerful ally of humanism and every american public school is a school of humanism what can theistic sunday schools meeting for an hour once a week and teaching only a fraction of the children do to stem the tide of a five day program of humanistic teaching
4175039 if we are to go forward we must go back and rediscover those precious values that all reality hinges on moral foundations and that all reality has spiritual control
4175040 it is very difficult even for well meaning people to get together and talk about how we talk to people about their sex lives and how to parent children
4175041 there are fewer and fewer successful role models for young people and we are trying to do something about that
4175042 about 80 of black babies are born to unwed moms
4175043 the only person who can deal with a bad ho is a good pimp

4175089 african americans have a slight slant to their eyes much like asians do but not as pronounced
4175090 during aging we found not only do the outer corners of the eyes of african americans droop lower than caucasians they also droop sooner
4175091 on top of honoring their ethnic uniqueness one of the biggest concerns african american women have is their tendency to show scars

4175097 my globe colleague todd wallack was the first to raise questions about patricks claim that his 1 billion life sciences initiative which stalled last year in the legislature could produce 250 000 jobs in a decade that wallack reported would be twice as many jobs as the state added from all sources over the past decade the life sciences sector currently employs 60 000 to 75 000 people in massachusetts
4175098 the more i think about it the less certain i am that we can fix this top down
4175099 state and local governments over the last five years have committed to spending an estimated 115 million to 235 million on 386 public employees who were allowed to invoke an obscure part of a state law to win earlier and significantly larger pensions a globe analysis has found
4175100 so not only will there be no effort to lift the overall cap on charters the administration may even impose a freeze that wouldnt otherwise be there in some districts consider the irony as administration officials tell it the readiness school effort is patricks attempt to apply the lessons of charter schools autonomy innovation choice responsiveness and a longer school day among others to the states traditional public schools and yet patrick is currently punting on expanding the very model that has produced those lessons

4175112 als damals unsere tochter lotta geboren wurde musste ich meiner frau versprechen dass ich bei den olympischen spielen eine medaille hole
4175113 sie hat den erfolg erst m glich gemacht sie ist auch ringerin und hatte eine vielversprechende karriere vor sich ich h tte ja auch bei den kindern bleiben k nnen
4175114 ich war sprachlos als bei der siegerehrung die deutsche fahne hochging
4175115 die silbermedaille war nach der langen durststrecke unheimlich wichtig jede epoche hat ihre h hen und tiefen wir waren in den 90er jahren sehr stark dann hatten wir einen durchh nger

4175121 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4175122 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4175123 oil prices are coming down they year but its still tough for people thats why we are cutting taxes by 4bn this year
4175124 the government sets out what it wants tax and benefits to look like but as its a difficult time it changes that

4175133 though mortgage mail volume remains far lower than a year ago this is the first uptick weve seen in two years
4175134 it could be because spring is a prime buying season or it could be a sign that lenders are slowly beginning to increase direct mail still we dont expect significantly higher mail volume until the market settles and consumer confidence returns

4175217 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4175218 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4175328 talabani received surgery on one of the blood vessels in his heart it was a successful operation
4175329 the physicians informed him that he may leave the hospital today or tomorrow and he will go to washington
4175330 there are no formal reasons to stop these accession talks
4175331 the statements that our accession should be delayed because of events in georgia sound strange
4175332 it contradicts basic logic common sense and promises that were given by the governments of western countries to russia
4175333 sorry for a rude expression but every time they are just fooling us around
4175334 after the july crisis russias accession could have provided support for the organization which is experiencing serious systemic problems
4175335 in this situation i do not think that this resumption of talks with georgia is possible therefore we will look at other ways of solving the problem
4175336 all sides are set to lose due to a delay of russias accession who will lose most is difficult to say
4175337 there will be more and more protests certainly through the olympics and the movement will grow stronger
4175338 were trying to arrange a peaceful pullout of the russian army
4175339 we had an agreement that the russians would leave gori at 7 a m 0300 gmt today but later they said would leave at 1 p m
4175340 and now they say they will leave in two or three days
4175341 the first step is joint patrols with the russian army and georgian police
4175342 the idea is for people to start returning to their homes
4175343 its been so difficult for the past few days but yesterday the russians came and it has been different
4175344 if ahmadinejad does not accept the accord on which agreement was reached the accord will not be signed during this visit
4175345 ahmedinejads visit has symbolical meaning with this visit iran gives the world the message that it is not possible to isolate iran
4175346 turkeys effort is not to solve the problem but ease the tension and keep the crisis at controllable levels
4175347 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end
4175348 find something youre passionate about and keep tremendously interested in it

4175371 in den letzten zwei jahren stellt die gus ein universelles verhandlungsforum dar auf dem sich wladimir putin mit michail saakaschwili der pr sident armeniens mit dem aserbaidschans treffen k nnen
4175372 doch zur zeit ist die gus ein interessenklub der trotz der reformversuche sie wurden von den pr sidenten kasachstans und russlands unternommen ein solcher auch bleibt deshalb gab es reale schritte im gus rahmen so gut wie nicht

4175375 i have to take the time out to apologize to the kids and to anyone who follows and supports my career for what happened at the ozone awards this past monday night
4175376 i told myself that i was gonna do my best for the new era of the streets not to go through the experiences that i go through in life
4175377 for a split second i almost entertained the little girl tactics of a person mike jones who is really irrelevant nowadays
4175378 things like this happen in life every day and i do not have the time to entertain this any more i would like the world to tell mr jones mike jones that he can thank me later for his split second of fame right now ima keep it moving
4175379 you better not say banks in your verse unless you talkin bout tyra
4175380 if we dont get an unexpected shock that pushes commodity prices back up this might be the worst inflation news that well get for a while
4175381 it is certainly above expectations here but i think weve probably seen for the near term anyway the worst of the inflation readings
4175382 there arent any real rules or guidelines for the process but its plausible it could get approved under the current administration
4175383 the facts are what they are and the facts are on our side
4175384 make no mistake if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers
4175385 it will still be bad for passengers bad for competition and bad for the u k and u s aviation industry
4175386 all we are trying to do is put ourselves to compete more competitively
4175387 this agreement just puts us on a level playing field
4175388 we wanted to wait until the market actually demonstrated access to london so we could take the wind out of that argument
4175389 american is looking to cover their costs no company can go on charging less for their product than it costs to produce it
4175390 i believe this is also good news for the industry
4175391 the job of the regulators is to assess the long term impact of the alliance on competition not to provide special protection from the immediate challenges of the economic cycle with which every other airline has to deal
4175392 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns
4175393 what in the lords name would compel dale nabors to take over this company from morg morgan and doyle and the others when they are in such bad shape
4175394 there are thousands of models like all the other thousands of models naomi campbell is the same way for me models are just pieces of wood that i carve to make clothes look beautiful
4175395 i worked on setting up this portal and i am outraged that its being used inappropriately
4175396 people can use it to blackmail each other with investigate each other find out things in investigations that can embarrass people and in a political campaign it can be used in an inappropriate way
4175397 if members of the thp are accessing this inappropriately i would suggest the attorney general get involved in this the district attorney and the tbi
4175398 well you did cos we can see it and you didnt clear it
4175399 well it says all manner of things things we didnt clear you saying
4175400 hmm we at co com do not take lightly to this sort of thing you should not have spoken to gamasutra
4175401 the internet more than most public forums of debate loves absolutes idiots and thinkers right and wrong black and white where did we lose our nuance when did we all become so beastly that we forgot how to have a conversation when did we become blind to the truth our opponents inevitably happen upon
4175402 hi there paul thanks so much for writing in you absolutely didnt need to do that but its much appreciated nonetheless i understand that the article was a stripped down version of what was said by necessity but i do think it accurately reflects the spirit of what you were saying even though its mostly presented in pithy soundbites it certainly wasnt my intention to sex up anything that was said for controversys sake of course this is the internet so people are as you say always going to misconstrue things and respond without fully reading thinking stuff through as i said in my blog post i think what you said was often true and the way you said it was very interesting id be hugely saddened if you felt like you needed to curb what you said at events like these strong opinions inspire lively debate which is often a good thing i also totally understand that you wanted to respond publicly in order to clarify some points and i dont begrudge you that the only thing that was slightly annoying in this whole thing was the response of your myspace readers who i guess responded in a similar way to many of the people who attacked your talk in the first place without comprehending it properly i dont think the majority of sensible people think of you as a mad egotistical designer just someone who takes a particular strong management style one which hopefully will be borne out in the final product mostly its just idiots on the internet stirring things up and shouting opinions without weight or nuance i actually did ask gamasutras editors if i could do an interview with you but apparently they have lengthy qa with you coming up so said theyd wait for that i would have loved to chat in a bit more deal about this stuff too but i was literally only commissioned to write up what was said in the talk and to send it over anyway no hard feelings at all and what co com dont realise is that this kind of thing only has a positive impact on your product in that more people are interested in it and talking about it as a result please continue to do these talks and continue to be opinionated and interesting lord knows far too few game developers are and yeah go and spend time with your kids because while videogames cost a lot of money and are occasionally important in comparison to your children they are about the most insignificant thing its possible to imagine take care paul and hope to catch up soon simon
4175403 its estimated there will be a global warming of 1 to 6 degrees by the end of the century and we examined how this could manifest at smaller spatial scales and within shorter time periods
4175404 we identified areas likely to be most responsive to changes in greenhouse gas emissions
4175405 one interesting and surprising result is that we see the same hot spot patterns even at lower greenhouse gas concentrations
4175406 this suggests we may be able to see these hot spots emerging already
4175407 there is no place in california where frogs are still thriving
4175408 the allies considered it was not appropriate at this time to approve the deployment of that ship
4175409 not just a process for applicants who miss their grades
4175410 many thousands of applicants from outside the ucas system apply at this time too
4175411 clearing attracts many non traditional applicants applying now for the first time others are mature students often looking for part time courses
4175412 a lot of young people think university is the be all and end all if they dont get the marks then theyve failed
4175413 they need to take the time to understand what else is available and what would be right and suitable for them
4175414 behind the statistics there are thousands of people whove made hasty or ill informed decisions choosing places that just arent suited to them they end up regretting it and it can be a costly error
4175415 under the right settings war works this is worth remembering some in the west who essentially believe that the end of history has arrived like to play down the utility of military force in the postmodern world to be intellectually highbrow in military strategic circles it is wise to talk up soft power legitimacy and even international law and insist that the military instrument be miniaturised to conform and to be fair this may be the world that some west europeans and liberal americans want to live in but if other powerful states do not buy into this utopian mindset then it is not the world the west lives in it is a dreamworld that has yet to seduce other states one would have thought that if this crisis shows anything it reminds us yet again that the writ of international law and proceduralism has definite limits russia knows it and the people of darfur burma zimbabwe and rwanda could be forgiven for agreeing
4175416 when it was motionless it was actually towed to the bay

4175422 that gold medal is a milestone of chinas olympic development it is part of history
4175423 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
4175424 i really cant imagine the kind of pressure shes been under
4175425 i cried on saturday after the 10m air rifle not because i failed to get the gold but because i let so many people down
4175426 to me the four days between the two competitions felt longer than four years in the practice session today i did not perform well and i thought of giving up but then i thought of the many people who had given me messages and postcards and i thought i could not give up this is why i was moved to tears today
4175427 the economic downturn in countries like the uk is one of many reasons

4175431 as dowd would have it men simply find her intelligence her status her wit too daunting
4175432 but is it possible that there is something else at play a new york magazine piece describes the wide variety of men dowd has been involved with ranging from movie stars to important editors to creators of television dramas one imagines that her intelligence her sharpness her sarcasm may even have interested these men could there possibly be another reason that the attractive successful dowd has not settled down
4175433 the book isnt at all pessimistic about the chances of strong successful women
4175434 but a lot of times i think its turned out that men find those things draining and oftentimes would rather be with a woman who is in awe of them
4175435 men are simply not biologically suited to hold higher office the bush administration has proved that once and for all
4175436 i dont look like any of the men on those dollar bills
4175437 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4175438 contracts are being given more insulation with tougher service level agreements and break out clauses
4175439 it was an amazing journey i visited forests witnessed illegal and industrial logging toured pulp mills and paper factories and met many inspiring people who explained the environmental and social impacts of paper manufacture and what we can all do to reduce them
4175440 most people think of paper as a harmless natural product but in fact the paper industry causes three times as much climate change emissions as aviation uses more water than any other industrial product as well as threatening forests and human rights in some producer countries
4175441 fortunately there is a lot that we can all do like recycling and reducing junk mail to lessen our paper footprints
4175442 with a satisfying sense of empowerment that you can crack your paper addiction
4175443 ive been writing away for years with no sign of a book and now three have come along at once
4175444 if our students dont have food to eat then they will not be able to learn
4175445 with the increase in fuel prices we all know theres just not enough money at the end of the week to buy all the snacks necessary
4175446 these snack packs consist of 10 to 12 snacks they can have peanuts crackers drinks those types of items
4175447 we purchase all our food through donations or grants and fuel costs going up and food has skyrocketed what we used to pay for a case of cereal was 33 now its 47 thats a lot of money

4175451 could help explain the incidence of some types of skin cancer in patients
4175452 very hard to relate to humans and sun induced skin cancer
4175453 moisturiser use is much greater among women however skin cancers and in particular the type of skin cancers studied in this research seem to be more common among men
4175454 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication

4175457 i climbed on my mothers lap and i kept saying why are you crying
4175458 and she kept saying nothing nothing and the more she hugged me the more emotional i got and i was crying too
4175459 the tv was on and it was the ed sullivan show and bill cosby was doing a routine about finding snakes in the bathroom i didnt know what he was talking about but my mother began to laugh she was laughing and crying and i began to laugh
4175460 it pained me to lose 7 years of garnishing a fan base as ill tarzan but maybe it was time for a change anyway plus fresh daily just fits me right i stay fresh all day every day with the rhymes with the style
4175461 but if we dont the fact that so many people come to youtube means they ultimately come to google and click on ads so we dont worry about all that traffic going to youtube id be worried if people werent using youtube but since its an enormous success globally we know we will benefit
4175462 i had to deal with it on my way up now im dumping it all on you
4175463 i tried it and immediately fell in love with playing lacrosse
4175464 its a great sport thats creative and really physical its become my favorite sport
4175465 it is unfortunate that he doesnt have the level of competition out here that will help him get better
4175466 when you can play on a team where you arent the best player on the field that is the time you get better im sure some of the camps over the summer will help him take that next step
4175467 talent to be as good as he wants to be
4175468 he has what it takes to be successful at the next level
4175469 when i commit ive decided to drop football and soccer in my senior year because i dont want to get hurt
4175470 if we lose any of our guys there is going to be a period of adjustment nathan has to do what is best for him
4175471 i didnt even get a chance to take a shower after the game
4175472 i thought id at least get a chance to take a shower and sleep for a couple of hours when i got there but i had to attend the camp first thing in the morning
4175473 lacrosse has opened so many doors to great schools who are interested in me
4175474 we are thrilled to have him playing for us and for him and the team getting the press
4175475 the downside is other teams feed off that hype and try to use it against him the second he slips up or makes a mistake you can hear the other team and their fans getting on him with the over rated comments
4175476 this year we are back in the bay league championship and we are looking to bring it home
4175477 once the fall and winter coaches at beverly high realize it is a great spring sport for their athletes to play in order to keep in game shape well be behind those programs
4175478 weve been fortunate over the last few years to be still riding off our strong middle school program from a few years ago but it has been fading

4175492 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another even as i have loved you that you also love one another
4175493 by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another

4175495 for you were called to freedom brethren only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another
4175496 with all humility and gentleness with patience showing tolerance for one another in love
4175497 and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds
4175498 above all keep fervent in your love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins
4175499 how great a love the father has bestowed on us that we would be called children of god and such we are for this reason the world does not know us because it did not know him
4175500 beloved let us love one another for love is from god and everyone who loves is born of god and knows god
4175501 no one has seen god at any time if we love one another god abides in us and his love is perfected in us
4175502 not as though i were writing to you a new commandment but the one which we have had from the beginning that we love one another
4175503 he who digs a pit will fall into it and he who rolls a stone it will come back on him
4175504 he who digs a pit may fall into it and a serpent may bite him who breaks through a wall
4175505 for if you forgive others for their transgressions your heavenly father will also forgive you
4175506 but if you do not forgive others then your father will not forgive your transgressions
4175507 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another even as i have loved you that you also love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
4175508 be devoted to one another in brotherly love give preference to one another in honor and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds above all keep fervent in your love for one another because love covers a multitude of sins

4175536 i mean most of the christian blogosphere just ignored the lying anyways and continued funding the ministry
4175537 in the end he was very disappointed not in tim dick but in rc sproul
4175538 formless the dispute isnt with rc sproul its with tim dick id agree that rc is ultimately responsible since he appointed dick as president ceo cfo thats a lot of unchecked power in one guys hands the problem is that since rcs stroke which was rather serious as i understand it rc doesnt have much to do with ligonier anymore
4175539 can anybody tell me if sproul sr is still being severely affected by his stroke how much time elapsed between the onset of the stroke and the contract with kistler and the lawsuit
4175540 but whether he knew about it before it happened or not it doesnt really matter he did find out right after the contract was signed and he didnt do anything to make it right with don even though don went to him repeatedly r c s character has definitely changed i think its because of the stroke i dont know what else to attribute it to
4175541 r c had a stroke in early 2004 and he may have had a couple more since then that werent as serious

4175545 if my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven will forgive their sin and will heal their land
4175546 sin will lead you farther than you want to go sin will teach you far more than you want to know sin will keep you longer than you want to stay sin will cost you far more than you want to pay
4175547 this is what happens when im not involved in the day to day of ligonier

4175553 the silence of the shepherds in dealing with the heresies in their own churches stems from their compromised philosophy and theology they cannot clearly articulate their differences with rome or practice what those differences require because at bottom they agree with rome

4175555 anyone whos followed r c jr knows hes fv i dont understand why he tries to hide it i just wish hed come out of the closet about it
4175556 i rejoice with the federal vision because i believe that its a golden brick road to rome so i thank god for the federal vision because its a termite within protestantism and its tearing away at the structure and everything thats falling out is coming to the roman catholic faith
4175557 everything thats falling out is coming to the roman catholic faith
4175558 indeed this is the perfect and complete glorification of god when one does not exult in his own righteousness but recognizing oneself as lacking true righteousness to be justified by faith alone in christ
4175559 i do believe it is reasonable to admit that part of the federal vision theology has influenced some to forsake reformed churches and go into anglican or roman catholic communions
4175560 i was an insider long enough to know that the issues are there and that they remain unresolved no matter how men posture themselves in front of the rest of the reformed world it amazes me that i read from certain covenantal headship advocates all about how these or other things dont really represent proper practice but the buck has to stop somewhere and last time i checked the leadership in question likes to take credit for everything else especially if it is a positive implementation of federal vision theology only unreasonable and overly zealous advocates of a position would imply that there are no negative consequences to these things being worked out in certain reformed environments
4175561 also i do not find tim dicks biblical doctrinal knowledge impressive
4175562 provided that the substance of the faith be kept entire
4175563 i must say i dont think you win any points by quoting a nut job like john robbins trinity foundation to bolster your otherwise legit concerns about the sprouls and ligonier

4175592 even the epsteins children which were never charged with any sin and were never the subject of church discipline have been punished by doug phillips and the entire bca congregation by shunning even jehovahs witnesses which are notorious for shunning know better than to do that
4175593 somewhere there is a place called perfect where parents offer their children anything from meeting titanic survivors
4175594 this is not about reconciliation this is only about the epsteins repenting
4175595 there is only one way for the epsteins to be reconciled with me they must come to me and repent fully without any equivocation of everything that we excommunicated them for and they also have to repent for blogging about me
4175596 this is not about reconciliation this is only about the epsteins repenting
4175597 i really hope im proven wrong about reconciliation ever happening between the epsteins and doug phillips
4175598 we waited as long as reasonable phillips obviously isnt interested in reconciling with the epsteins so were putting our articles back up were also going to run some stories about doug phillips being a racist hes accused us of being racists and conspiring with racists so its only fair that his own racial views and friendships with racists be scrutinized too and were going to use the same standards that he used to judge us

4175604 but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren

4175607 he also said that we must return to biblical manhood and womanhood and at this point he utterly shattered the nonsense that some people falsely propagate about the teachings of the patriarchy movement
4175608 it does appear that there may be some theological holes in some of the tenets
4175609 why is it wrong for us to look to him for help with this
4175610 none of us like to hear that we are wrong that we have to make changes in our lives that we have to adjust our way of thinking or that we have to admit our faults we are loathe to confess that are in need of repentance forgiveness or forbearance and we persist in our pride even when we know the truth the truth demands something of us it may or may not demand something of us as dramatic as what it demanded of the passengers of flight 93 though the truth ultimately sets us free it does so at some cost
4175611 even the people attacking patriarchy probably see that hes really smart
4175612 there is also the danger that some men will over react against the common emasculated concept of the modern
4175613 he said that we need visionary daughters who are capable intelligent well trained and love being women

4175625 we will likely have to continue to surgically hack away at his infected flesh at the bedside in order to keep infection at bay
4175626 to inflict this kind of assault on him without a reasonable hope of benefit is an abomination
4175627 by and large the healthcare team and the family are able to work together to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution
4175628 it speaks well for the communication that does happen that you dont see more of these in the courts or on the front pages of the newspapers
4175629 the vast vast majority are resolved through communication negotiation building trust and forming good relations between clinicians and family members
4175630 but i do not believe there was an expectation that he would improve
4175631 just an expectation that he would declare more definitively as non viable
4175632 there is no fundamental rule or law about how these cases are handled
4175633 is that final step to say at the end of the day when you cant come to an agreement heres how to make the decision
4175634 i would have made the move earlier but we kept expecting a court decision
4175635 how far do a physicians professional obligations go can you make them provide care that they completely disagree with
4175636 the kind of care that we have been ordered to provide mr golubchuk
4175637 in the absence of a perceived appropriate medical indication would in most circumstances be considered assault
4175638 i thought it was quite likely he would die from this if not aggressively and routinely debrided
4175639 however if the kind of debridement he needed was provided by the end he would have had little flesh left between his knees and the small of his back
4175640 up to the point that i left i followed the letter and spirit of the court order
4175641 would have had to start to sacrifice their integrity in order not to torture the guy it might not have been conscious but it would have happened
4175642 physicians often feel in situations like this that providing ongoing care is really an affront to their medical ethics
4175643 we have to ask ourselves whose values should take precedence

4175669 how can phillips fulfill his biblical obligation to admonish the epsteins if he refuses to speak with them
4175670 how so many in presbyterian churches cont to drink and profess to follow christ bothers me i did not know presbyterians did this there is no such thing as a social drinker ask any licensed cac certified alcohol counselor in your county take audit it is a self assessment test for alcoholism
4175671 i have no intention of attacking either you or the epsteins
4175672 seems like a thinly veiled insinuation that he has considered attack or warns me that he can attack me doesnt it

4175674 our weekend began with father daughter unity games each of the games was designed to teach us a principle about our relationship with our fathers
4175675 hearing and seeing the example again this weekend confirmed in their hearts that this is the direction they want for their lives
4175676 my older daughter is already taking the initiative to learn more on the domestic front and her spirit is noticeably softer now that she has a direction in life that coincides with the way god naturally wired her as a woman my younger daughter is watching intently the example of her older sister and both have turned to me as their dad and their head it is a beautiful and lovely thing to be a father of daughters when we do things according to scripture
4175677 to me all this appears to do is to prepare a young lady for a life of obsequious bondage to a master not a husband
4175678 relate to me as a loving husband not as a harsh master or owner
4175679 gothard and the iblp have this thing about fathers giving their daughters
4175680 but by changing the name from father daughter dance to purity ball you change everything starting with making your little girls body and sexual behavior the central focus of the event yuck
4175681 why not a project they can work on together so she really learns some useful skill the vast majority of women dont shave their husbands
4175682 the girl about 18 or so told how there was nothing better than being in her fathers arms all night long also when she has a bad day she goes to her dad and tells him to hold her and tell her how beautiful she is
4175683 it is a beautiful and lovely thing to be a father of daughters when we do things according to scripture
4175684 or as long as were on the scarlet a topic how about those of you who actually have done the dirty deed with someone other than your spouse in your lifetime maybe it was 20 years ago when you were 16 you repented of it at the time and committed with the lord and perhaps an elder in your church not to allow such temptation to rule your life again but then someone finds out about it and ooooh
4175685 chose who you are going to be someone who lives like there is forgiveness available or like a judgmental accuser as for me and my house well celebrate forgiveness and the gift of the holy spirit to remind us how to live in his righteousness
4175686 and then ill let my kid fire up the norelco and buzz my face who knows maybe ill even let her trim the back of my neck
4175687 do unto others as you would have done unto you
4175688 thus while i take complete umbrage at your inferring that i am weird because my daughter likes to pick out shirts for me fix my tie and buzz my face its ok i would strongly suggest you rethink your slap at your brothers in christ i especially encourage you to re think the mind numbing implication that this is akin to raising geishas
4175689 geisha are frequently depicted as expensive prostitutes in western popular culture geisha are entertainers their purpose being to entertain their customer be it by reciting verse playing musical instruments light conversation geisha engagements may include flirting with men and playful innuendos however clients know that nothing more can be expected in a social style that is uniquely japanese men are amused by the illusion of that which is never to be geisha do not engage in paid sex with clients
4175690 why because the accuser implies that christs blood is not sufficient to cover the one who asked for forgiveness
4175691 nor do i really care about your justification for the disgusting and depraved inference you draw to the geishas nor the pathetic defense of it you offered as i previously said everyone is entitled to his or her opinion no matter how erroneous debased or stupid it might be
4175692 thus i dont particularly give a flying rats patootie at your opinion on a girl shaving a fathers face a boy shaving his mothers legs or if the mother has any reason to bother shaving her own legs
4175693 again my point is strictly with how you again plural love to drag up sins which have been covered by the shed blood of jesus christ from everything i have read the biblical process of restoration is in full swing
4175694 it is not up to me or anyone else to judge a persons repentance
4175695 the ministry watchman site is full of self professed experts who have no clue what they are talking about thus let the reader be wary
4175696 never engage in a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent
4175697 those women whose profession it is to play musical instruments and dance at parties
4175698 dephallicizing women in ryukyo shinshi a critique of gender ideology in japanese literature
4175699 antropologist liza dalby studied the lives of the licensed entertainer prostitutes known as geisha the geisha she writes lived decent lives only compared to ordinary licensed prostitutes lived dreadful as life was for the geisha they were better off than the girls who were sent not to the geisha houses but to brothels
4175700 again my point is strictly with how you again plural love to drag up sins which have been covered by the shed blood of jesus christ from everything i have read the biblical process of restoration is in full swing
4175701 when town geisha muchi geisha or sato geisha started appearing in the mid eighteenth century the distinction between prostitutes and geisha was blurred and geisha began to practice prostitution as well
4175702 we appreciate your sincerity in apologizing to the violations recorded in the declaratory judgment
4175703 your confession and repentance are received and you are forgiven
4175704 a true man takes responsibility for his failures that is why a godly mans best posture is on his knees repenting
4175705 we believe you men have modeled this attitude above all and we are most humbled by your humility
4175706 i have weighed the importance of making this point against a maxim i have
4175707 in addition we confess that because of instances where our offices and authority have been mishandled some families have been hurt and others unknown to us could have been offended
4175708 in the sessions so called letter of repentance you repeatedly ask for forgiveness how is one to forgive sins which are justified equivocated excused and blame shifted i cant say as im at all familiar with such a practice nevertheless we do forgive you you are not forgiven because of your letter for your letter is an utter sham
4175709 i pray that some day each of you men will genuinely repent and that we can be reconciled and that you will not only be reconciled to the kershaws but reconciled to the austins the burtons the bransons the saenzs the wintons the hutchinsons the fontinots dennis cochran and all the other former st peter members and christian brethren that you have wounded injured and outright attacked slandered gossiped against and poisoned relationships with your meager efforts toward repentance are as of this date entirely inadequate
4175710 as for ms connie please dont forget my point was not the historical facts of the sex for hire geishas my point was to prove that connie and hate mongers like her are not the experts that they want the readers to believe she made a foul mouthed disgusting implication that those dads in the photo as well as others are nothing more than hooker breeders for that she should repent publicly for lying given her professed knowledge of geishas if she wasnt lying she should admit to ignorance and apologize for the inference she made
4175711 bondage is when we make a man made system and foist it on others and if they dont hold up under it they are judged as less than spiritual
4175712 there may be some that would rather go fishing but they are not the norm
4175713 no one has said that women should not be educated in fact it is quite to the contrary the point is education to what end is it higher education for the sake of educating the mind for future endeavors such as homeschooling your children or is it education with the purpose of pursuing a career
4175714 the point is education to what end is it higher education for the sake of educating the mind for future endeavors such as homeschooling your children or is it education with the purpose of pursuing a career
4175715 do you know what ages or if there is an age limit on the girls who participate in this shaving game and the blind obedience game
4175716 when did serving your husband become wrong or training a girl to serve her father wrong my husband serves me my sons are trained to serve me and their sisters i serve my husband my daughters are trained to serve their father and their brothers
4175717 the vision forums annual father and daughter discipleship retreats including
4175718 but for liberals everything has a double meaning usually about sex because thats all liberals have to think about their sex organs

4175720 go on little susie dont be nervous daddys not afraid gaaaack
4175721 but for liberals everything has a double meaning usually about sex because thats all liberals have to think about their sex organs
4175722 i think the problem is that for most people especially most conservatiuve people comments like
4175723 wow how nasty can we get folks what does that have to do with anything

4175728 please remove me from your mailing list the use of this tragedy by any organization to promote an agenda is unconscionable
4175729 when people ask why does god allow bad things to happen to good people or how can such a terrible thing happen we must point them to the fundamentals first all of us deserve death and all of us will die
4175730 thousands will be deeply affected probably for the rest of their lives the most serious pains belong to the mothers fathers and sisters and brothers of the murdered victims what shall we say to them what are we to learn from these events
4175731 second we must acknowledge that the rise of community violence is a judgment of the lord
4175732 what you need to learn from this is that this is the judgment of the lord
4175733 this is the judgment of god he deserved to die
4175734 do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good
4175735 for judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy mercy triumphs over judgment
4175736 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal
4175737 our nation has broken covenant with the god of our fathers we have forsaken the law of god and have worshipped before false idols we have sacrificed our children not only spiritually and intellectually to the high priests of a new secular religion in our government schools
4175738 female students are not included they must depend on the benevolence and quick thinking of a male student for protection
4175739 they must depend on the benevolence and quick thinking of a male
4175740 i am only glad that you are brave enough to call a spade a spade
4175741 phillips article is likely to be interpreted by many as a message that god is cruel unloving uncaring judgmental and only too eager to destroy sinners
4175742 it is all pretty simple to me we are aliens here we are strangers we are to go out and preach the gospel and teach others about christ not everyone is called to be a christian and those that are not christians cannot obey gods word
4175743 why does it seem that the reformed folk dont understand their own doctrine have they not read romans lately
4175744 doug phillips is a pasty painfully effeminate man in extreme denial about his true nature in an attempt to forestall the dissemination of this information as if it wasnt patently obvious to all observers he attempts to exert hypermasculine power in an extrabiblical manner against not just those he is in actual authority over but all women
4175745 for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god
4175746 doug is calling secular government itself an idol and he is calling secularism a religion in other words if you are not for theocracy you are necessarily against it
4175747 phillips is actually advocating that students carry guns into the classroom
4175748 ooh he hurt my feelings it was truth but it just wasnt timely
4175749 corrie upbraids phillips on his 9 11 post because he said
4175750 since when have reformed christians decided that gun control was ok
4175751 and you know something else i grew up in a time boys did carry their 22s or 410s to school and you know what there werent columbines and there werent v tech massacres
4175752 like reformed calvinist pointed out you are apparently severely deficient in your history
4175753 oh and i think it would be too patriarchal to try and stop a 250lb black guy from raping a girl maybe we should just forget all that absurd nonsense about chivalry and protecting the weaker sex
4175754 then the feminists run wild talking about how he hurt their feelings
4175755 ooh he hurt my feelings it was truth but it just wasnt timely
4175756 you are really reaching cbn aired something similar to this drawing parallels to the culture of violence the absence of god from schools and the abortion pandemic just the other night wheres the outcry there
4175757 his tone of voice or use of rhetoric is somewhat beside the point yes
4175758 i find it interesting that mw can barely muster a wimper in response to the devastating fpc information posted on the boerne site
4175759 apparently she hasnt ever read authors like francis schaffer or any other christian apologist because every single one of them starting with augustine recognizes that secularism is a religion where were the men to defend against this absurd assertions
4175760 since when have reformed christians decided that gun control was ok
4175761 also its interesting that little bear and his session posted a devastating statement that
4175762 such an interesting pattern ive observed over this whole doug phillips brouhaha so many double standards
4175763 anonymous internet terrorists cease and desist for the sake of christs name
4175764 i have appreciated what has been written here at mw for sometime now but im am getting seriously turned off from anything you have the say when i read posts like this and see that just about the only commenters are feminists
4175765 what about all those children who have lost their mother and all those husbands who have lost their wife is it because doug doesnt believe that those women would have died if they would have been home where they belonged
4175766 who is pro gun control just because some of us believe there should be limits
4175767 boys carried their loaded guns to school in what era
4175768 the right to keep and bear arms as a part of english and american law antedates not only the constitution but also the discovery of firearms
4175769 citizens burgesses free tenants villeins and others from 15 to 60 years of age
4175770 anyone else who can afford them shall keep bows and arrows
4175771 shall come without all force and armor well and peaceably
4175772 affray of the peace nor to go nor ride armed by day or by night in fairs markets nor in the presence of the justices or other ministers
4175773 accompanied with such circumstances as are apt to terrify the people
4175774 i dont have a clue as to why you brought race into this
4175775 do you need a gun to stop a guy from raping a girl
4175776 calvin carried a loaded gun martin luther carried a loaded gun knox carried a gun
4175777 when the murderers and bloodhounds wish to wage war and murder it is in truth no insurrection to rise against them and defend oneself
4175778 but i would ask you how do you know that what schaffer writes is true have you checked his writings against augustine or aquinas or any of the antenicene fathers have you checked them against the bible
4175779 to assert that secularism is a religion simply because schaeffer some other writer says that it is is really going out on a limb
4175780 if r c jrs daughter is gonna marry doug phillips son then i guess hes not gonna have covenant children
4175781 i would be especially interested in their view of the virginia tech policies that forbid even off duty law enforcement officers from carrying their weapons on campus surely an off duty law enforcement officer can be trusted to handle a firearm even the most rabid anti gun person i know does not begrudge the police the ability to carry
4175782 i do not have the time nor desire to give you an entire world view lesson about the significance of secularism secular humanism its relation to religion and its membership of the category therein
4175783 lastly i think it unfair to refer to corrie and cj and anyone else who thinks its irresponsible to arm college kids
4175784 one of the students in that university had been armed cho seung hui could have been stopped
4175785 doug is calling secular government itself an idol and he is calling secularism a religion
4175786 secularism is that which seeks the development of the physical moral and intellectual nature of man to the highest possible point as the immediate duty of life which inculcates the practical sufficiency of natural morality apart from atheism theism or the bible which selects as its methods of procedure the promotion of human improvement by material means and proposes these positive agreements as the common bond of union to all who would regulate life by reason and ennoble it by service
4175787 we believe however that traditional dogmatic or authoritarian religions that place revelation god ritual or creed above human needs and experience do a disservice to the human species any account of nature should pass the tests of scientific evidence in our judgment the dogmas and myths of traditional religions do not do so
4175788 bible actually defines that which is secular by underscoring the difference between mundane fleshly things and godly spiritual things
4175789 the creation was redeemed by christ and to assert that there is
4175790 but i must ask what actually changed from 11 59 59pm and 12 00 00am in the life of the applicant absolutely nothing
4175791 here is the problem with that i believe that the 2nd amendment expresses a right granted by god a right anciently recognized amongst our people but not granted by government
4175792 the problem watchman is that if you were to go to the v tech campus you would be forbidden to carry
4175793 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
4175794 but the point of what happened at v tech is not that some 19 year old college student didnt have a gun though i believe they should have the ability and right to carry it is the point that anybody regardless of age maturity qualifications past experiences position of authority in the classroom or licenses obtained were prohibited from carrying on the v tech campus
4175795 one of the students in that university had been armed cho seung hui could have been stopped
4175796 i rise to cast doubt on the arranged marriage rumor
4175797 there is scarce a frenchman worth looking on who has not killed his man in a duel

4175799 it challenged the old anti woman line that used spiritual psychological metaphysical and pseudo historical explanations for womens oppression with a real materialist analysis for why women do what we do
4175800 among racially motivated bias incidents 6 in 10 targeted blacks 3 in 10 targeted whites and the remainder targeted asians or american indians
4175801 seems the reformed folks have a propensity for name calling mud slinging and arrogance
4175802 the point isnt the gun if he was walking down the street with a claymore not the land mine youd have the exact same objections
4175803 black women are less likely to report being raped in the first place
4175804 there are about six times as many violent criminals per capita among blacks as whites
4175805 this is so weird that this has come up now as i had never heard of

4175819 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building

4175837 motorists are right when they say there should be enough transparency in the marketplace that they know what they re getting when they pull up to a fuel pump
4175838 prices in states like california and oregon have taken a freefall and we dont know why idahos market should be any different higher oil prices were blamed for record gas prices it seems reasonable to assume gas prices should go down when oil prices drop as they have

4175850 all the leaders stressed the importance of standing by a sovereign free georgia and its territorial integrity and agreed on the need for russia to stop the violence abide by the ceasefire and withdraw its forces
4175851 our position on georgias territorial integrity is not going to change no matter what anybody says and so i would consider that bluster coming from the foreign minister of russia and we will ignore it

4175874 i would have liked the break to be a bit longer but we got everything done that we wanted to thought things over and got myself ready for this last part of the season

4175876 i had to stop for a week and a half and then i started to recover the movement of the wrist and fingers
4175877 it was good to have the break and tomorrow i will see when i jump on the bike how the situation is now of course it should be better and i hope its enough but you can only imagine how it will be until you try to ride at the maximum level you never know what your limitations are

4175935 the missouri constitution requires that voters be given a single subject when changes to state laws are proposed by initiative petitions this lawsuit raises the constitutionality of having numerous subjects placed before voters in the same ballot measure

4175958 recreational driving or cruising has been a rite of passage for generations of teenagers representing freedom and independence to anyone old enough to obtain a licence but record high gas prices are putting the brakes on the classic summertime activity the carefree days of driving for the sake of driving are over teens say theyre now spending as little time behind the wheel as possible hanging out instead at friends houses at parks and beaches and at movie theatres the romance of cruising fades teens say when they have to scrutinize their gas consumption like minutes on their cellphones

4175963 andy johnson will not be able to feature because he had a thigh strain when he came to the club
4175964 we dont want to take the risk with that although im pretty sure he will be able to play against arsenal the following week
4175965 when we started our negotiations he had taken part in a shooting practice at everton just before they left for america and got a strain in his left thigh
4175966 then the problem was that during the negotiations there was a break in the treatment which wasnt advantageous because we werent allowed to treat him
4175967 we started to treat him as soon as we could which was four or five days after the incident but that unfortunately has cost us a week

4175978 the orders were served on the first defendant williams certainly that betters our position and what we are doing at the moment is observing whether he will breach that order by playing in a game scheduled for friday morning australian time
4175979 the first defendant and the second defendant nasser were notified of the listing today
4175980 it would appear at this stage there is no appearance
4175981 i think weve got some time to go before we get to that though i think weve got to stick solid with the sanctity of the contract
4175982 our first big test is tonight against toulouse who were the champions last season its a big game
4175983 the thing is in the heat of the moment instinct takes over and thats what he is used to doing
4175984 i dont think the way to beat them is to rough them up youve just got to be physical and match them as much as you can up front
4175985 were not going to go out there throwing punches and carrying on like idiots
4175986 its a sign of how youve got to play melbourne
4175987 its going to be physical its on a smaller field they play through the middle of the park youve got to have some big tough guys there ready to go into battle
4175988 i suppose it is a bit of a sign of how the games going to be but i think everyones pretty sure how theyre going to turn up
4175989 teams come in trying to play that aggressive in your face type of football and we kind of enjoy it too fighting fire with fire standing up to be counted
4175990 you have to match up depending on what tactic teams bring you adapt to it
4175991 i dont think anyone knows where were at right now even ourselves
4175992 this is probably a good week to try and get things back on track but its not the be all and end all
4175993 the girls havent been informed theyre having a sleep in and we would appreciate a shutdown this morning
4175994 nobody from basketball nz has even spoken to them about it yet
4175995 but its a huge game for us tomorrow and thats where our sole focus is right now
4175996 but we still see the sirens as an important part of our pathway towards the tall ferns and hope this is not the end of the concept
4175997 basically we are simplifying and coalescing our efforts around atom as the single brand for internet devices
4175998 the main reason for signing the long term deal was due to the success ive enjoyed since ive been at the club
4175999 ive fulfilled a dream by winning a premiership and gone on to play representative football with new south wales
4176000 for the rest of this season ive decided no more
4176001 maybe in a few weeks ill do a few schoolboy tournaments or i might just play golf or something
4176002 ill teach you to show me the f ing red card you so and so
4176003 i sent off three team taranaki players in the last game of the central league season and there was no controversy over it at all really
4176004 it has taken a long time but hes made some massive improvements so he has got there on merit
4176005 aussie mclean did some really good work with him during the hurricanes season and i think what maa has learned is you can tackle low enjoy the game and still play at a really high level
4176006 we think he has that game and we are seeing it at training
4176007 when you have good kickers around you though it is hard he has dan inside him
4176008 im a great believer that well rounded skills make you a better player and the ability to make the opposition think about what you are going to do makes you a much more dangerous player
4176009 we see the ability in maa to play that sort of game we are starting with a different model
4176010 his ability to recover from errors and getting out of tackle situations reloading so hes available for the team weve really worked hard on and i think its improved his game
4176011 its good i suppose its one of those things that not too many people do especially these days
4176012 its taken 13 years and its been good fun and i hope we get a good result on saturday night to celebrate it
4176013 when i started playing for northland all those years ago it was the last thing on my mind and i didnt even realise it was coming up
4176014 something just popped up on the tv during our match against taranaki on sunday and yeah i guess its a pretty unique achievement and one of those things that we may not see again because of the way guys tend to go overseas these days
4176015 i was just glad to be playing that game and to put in a half decent performance after having a bit of a shocker the week before against counties
4176016 i thought i might have played my last game for auckland after that one
4176017 obviously im probably not the quickest player around the field these days but certainly in the set pieces i think i can still handle myself all right
4176018 the most bizarre thing about the john edwards scandal may be that infamous tabloid the national enquirer actually broke the news long ago and the mainstream media ignored the story until last week
4176019 is it any wonder so many old school media companies are in such a sorry state
4176020 to its credit a new york times article acknowledged that news agencies including its own lapsed only picking up the story after disneys abc got edwards interview and admission of the affair the article also included what struck me as a litany of lame excuses from media companies including cbs washington post and the new york times itself
4176021 the antics of paris britney and lindsay are often covered with far more depth than much more serious current events
4176022 audiences flee to the internet for more plentiful and diverse content and advertisers find google an effective alternative
4176023 led to a race to the bottom which doesnt exactly set the stage for growth or even survival
4176024 speaking of the internets influence news corp s wall street journal admitted in an article that internet sources the drudge report washington posts slate and the huffington post recognized the possibility the edwards story might be true and questioned the old guards inaction
4176025 weve done our homework and things like that we are slowly building
4176026 there are guys here who are eight weeks into their international career but there are also guys who are 10 years into it
4176027 you have to have guys who are feeding off each other and enjoying themselves and i think thats what we are getting
4176028 the coaching staff are allowing us that balance and the guys are installing the discipline you dont want to go too far one way or the other
4176029 i didnt want to look back in 10 years time and wonder what if i thought i would regret it if i didnt give it a shot in new zealand
4176030 because its televised people can make up their own minds about how good he is
4176031 as a team the best positive we can take from last week was that we came back we didnt play well but we hung in there
4176032 what we have seen from them is that they have a lot of experience and they will try to put us under pressure

4176047 the thing i really like about him is that if he were healthy hed still be a professional basketball player
4176048 but hes done a lot of things to put himself in a position to be a coach since his career ended and as the interview process went on he really showed how knowledgeable he is
4176049 i just swam at my own pace not caring about the others my coach said to me we have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best

4176083 we have intelligence inputs militants may try to carry out attacks
4176084 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past

4176086 weve got to be ready to play and thats what weve got to do i am not looking at it any other way
4176087 we didnt want anyone pushing the panic button this canada is a very good team we have been talking all the long about playing with our backs to the wall and this is a good test for us
4176088 the explanation i got i dont know the explanation on the first one was right on but the second one i cant buy that i dont know if he the third base umpire who made the call was trying to make a statement or not after that they the umpires just decided to let both pitchers do what they do
4176089 be like yes because they have point of view as a property of the molecules that compose it so they can react to the conditions around them via physics
4176090 i started my photography business after the birth of my first child and i couldnt put down the camera my husband was in a wedding and the night before at the rehearsal dinner that their photographer wasnt going to show up so they asked me i was so nervous and went out there and did the best i could i shook the entire wedding i was so scared but i did pretty good and they loved the photos so i built up my business after that my favorite part of weddings i think has to be getting to know the couple i love meeting their family and friends i love when their family gives toasts and speaks about them and wishes them well it is such a wonderful time where the whole family comes together everyone is so excited for this couple to start their life together i love the reception as well i love how once the toasts dinner and cake is done everyone lets loose after months of planning and stressing they are able to relax have fun and create memories im a part of that and feel so honored krista and tims wedding was really special to me their family was really welcoming to myself and my assistant i love the details that krista and tim had at their wedding their quirky cake their table settings the grooms cake everything they both were really laid back and willing to have fun that is always a photographers dream

4176096 bill has done an excellent job running our richmond operations
4176097 and understands that the keys to our success are building outstanding relationships maintaining a keen focus on market conditions and providing effective leadership we are proud to have bill as a member of our senior team and to recognize his accomplishments with this well deserved promotion
4176098 we are taking steps to commercialize iogen as a dietary supplement
4176099 the product is expected to be available for sale by october initially the product will be sold online directly to consumers other distribution channels will be explored as we move forward we have taken steps to reduce our expenses primarily by the departure of our scientific officer and a salary reduction for our president while these steps have extended the companys operational horizon we will need additional funding before the end of 2008
4176100 become the change you want to see in the world
4176101 during this current industry cycle we have managed our resources carefully and with a long term focus
4176102 we intend to maintain the proper staffing production and financial resources necessary to take advantage of the expected future recovery of our markets
4176103 this focus will give us the scope and capability to take advantage of recovery in our markets and remain solidly positioned as the market leader in our industry the second half of 2008 carries a renewed optimism with respect to the oil and gas industry in the west compared to the first half industry experts have revised their forecasts for drilling activity for the balance of 2008 and our western branches should see some benefit from that in the upcoming quarters in addition we expect that favourable natural gas prices will cause many customers to revisit their capital programs for 2008 and adjust their 2008 budgets upward
4176104 we have seen southgobi energy resources our 79 owned subsidiary become the newest coal producer in mongolia and report impressive ongoing exploration success greatly increasing its high quality coal resources as it prepares to make its first export shipments to buyers in china
4176105 it is a natural extension of our strategy to apply the southgobi energy development model to our copper gold and uranium assets in australia where we have just completed an initial public offering of our australian assets on the australian stock exchange
4176106 we set out to daylight asset value this year the achievements during the second quarter and in subsequent weeks including the sale of our interest in the chinese gold producer jinshan gold mines in may which produced a gain of us 201 million have demonstrated our commitment to the strategy ivanhoe australia and southgobi energy resources also have benefited by gaining access to global capital markets and investors focused on asian coal and australian assets
4176107 i have never had the need to do marketing but with everything the way it is my loan volume has dried up

4176110 child julia child shaken not stirred dear thats right now you add just a pinch of ginger and dress it with some freshly peeled lemon rind oh delicious
4176111 i had personal experience of low aspirations of parents in much of the north east not all of the north east
4176112 theres nothing like parental aspiration for improving childrens a level results if you could quantify it i have no doubt that would be the major factor
4176113 there are plenty of parents in london and the south east that have low aspirations for their children but maybe a higher proportion in the north east
4176114 i think its hard if you have an area where it hasnt been traditional for young people to go to university
4176115 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4176116 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4176117 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4176118 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4176119 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4176120 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4176121 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4176122 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4176123 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4176124 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4176125 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4176126 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4176127 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4176128 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4176129 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4176130 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4176131 it would be the wrong thing to do by anybodys definition i think senator clinton should be honored but i think that it would absolutely the wrong thing to do and i think she should discourage her supporters from doing that
4176132 we need to communicate that hillary is the true democrat
4176133 that obama has betrayed all of the core principals that matter the most to his core supporters like the war in iraq fisa etc were going to keep the message alive that she is the truer candidate the more electable candidate
4176134 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
4176135 we feel theres been a coup that the dnc no longer represents the will of the democratic party
4176136 i cant image what 12 000 calories looks like thats about eight meals a day big meals
4176137 he needs to eat calorie rich food and thats what chocolate chip pancakes are
4176138 im not surprised athletes eat like that all the time
4176139 toevertrouwen tjah misschien niet altijd even verstandig vandaar dat ik nog al even twijfelde ook omdat het updaten van zon blog niet altijd even makkelijk is en de inspiratie soms ver weg is je ziet een beetje ervaring had ik het laatste jaar toch al opgedaan op weblog gebied
4176140 quite how the stockings came to rest in my family in the early years of the last century we do not know
4176141 but it is likely they came from the marr or harland family in north yorkshire and were given to my mother in around 1910
4176142 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
4176143 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
4176144 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
4176145 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
4176146 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
4176147 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
4176148 its a very essential process to be able to repair the dna
4176149 our study addresses one step of this very complicated process we figured out how a critical enzyme is regulated
4176150 solving one structure gives you just a snapshot but if you have several structures you can understand how they work
4176151 if we can find a way to target the machinery that corrects damage happening during cell division we could specifically kill those cells undergoing rapid division
4176152 we found that the oil and gas blocks overlap perfectly with the most biodiverse part of the amazon for birds mammals and amphibians
4176153 the threat to amphibians is of particular concern because they are already the most threatened group of vertebrates worldwide
4176154 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
4176155 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
4176156 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
4176157 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

4176159 this finding may yield new insights into a form of altered brain activity occurring in schizophrenia
4176160 it may also lead to new methods for screening drugs with potential as schizophrenia treatments
4176161 its analogous to tuning in the weak signal of a distant station on your car radio as opposed to picking up the strong signal of a station thats nearby
4176162 for the first time we were able to show that neuregulin 1 which has been genetically implicated in schizophrenia affects a brain activity that appears to be altered in schizophrenia
4176163 future studies of brain regions rich in erb4 receptors may yield important information on the nature of schizophrenia
4176164 our data indicate that the increase in adenocarcinoma is real and a growing health problem for both white men and women
4176165 well be looking at the effects of the earthquake on the ground and for evidence of what actually happened during the earthquake well be looking very closely at how the tectonic blocks actually moved in relation to each other
4176166 much of what actually happens during earthquakes is difficult to view because it occurs deep below the surface by looking at the way in which roads pipelines rivers and other man made markers are affected we can map out how the earth moved what faults were responsible and what kind of activity we might expect in future events
4176167 aftershocks are expected after every large earthquake and this has been no exception earthquakes release stress where they occur but they also cause increased stress in the surrounding rock and this additional pressure has to be released peak aftershock activity is generally in the first few days after the main quake and the number and size of aftershocks decreases rapidly after that
4176168 we are conscious of being as sensitive as possible while working in this area there is still a lot of recovery work going on and there are obvious long term infrastructural problems we hope to be able to visit the town of beichuan which was decimated by the earthquake but this will depend very much on the local authorities were very thankful to the sichuan provincial government for granting us access to the earthquake zone at such a critical time the location of the active faults is crucial we want to see if the faults that weve previously mapped were activated during the earthquake or if the quake occurred along a new set of faults knowing where the active faults lie and how much they are likely to move in future events can help the chinese authorities in planning new buildings and towns to reduce the likelihood of future casualties
4176169 die nachfrage nach stahlprodukten entwickelt sich weiterhin sehr erfreulich was sich auch in weiter steigenden preisen u ert

4176171 offer up a great case study on the typical strategies evoked while arguing with someone about a team a player stats or anything else sports related
4176172 we won the most golds the athletes play for golds youre an american and your culture exemplifies the win or go home attitude so we won china had the best olympic showing
4176173 your country has 1 billion more people you have to factor that in
4176174 you won a bunch of sports that nobody cares about big whoop
4176175 why does it have to be all about gold being top 3 in the olympics in any sport is a huge achievement total medals is what counts
4176176 no me arrepiento de no haber ido con espa a a la eurocopa
4176177 la verdad es que no me arrepent nada fue una decisi n que tom y que tomamos todos en conjunto y que la ten a muy clara era consciente de lo que necesitaba en ese momento y era consciente de lo que me perd en ese momento pero en ning n momento me arrepent segu todos los partidos y me alegr mucho que espa a ganara

4176182 to our knowledge this is the first report to show that doxorubicin and zoledronic acid inhibit subcutaneous breast tumor growth in vivo in a treatment sequence specific fashion and in the absence of tumor induced bone disease
4176183 our data suggest that there may be benefits of combining zoledronic acid with cytotoxic agents for the treatment of patients with early stage breast cancer
4176184 the overall effect sizes that we are reporting for all classes of drugs are small
4176185 the potential implications for current practice and future research should be tempered as a result of this finding
4176186 who are at an increased risk for liver disease progression and would therefore potentially benefit from early interventions such as reg ular screening to detect disease progression and treatment
4176187 one of the main challenges is to determine whether secondary prevention can be accomplished with new antiviral therapies for hbv infection
4176188 people inherit angelman syndrome as a mutant ube3a gene that does not make ube3a protein
4176189 the simplest explanation for the disease biochemistry is that when ube3a is not around to do its job its substrates arent being degraded like they should be and these proteins build up and interfere with brain functions
4176190 weve known for more than 10 years which gene is at fault but we havent known some of the specifics of the process
4176191 now that we know that the fly gene works pretty much the way that the human one does we can look for the key substrate in flies and eventually test likely candidates in mice and see if theyre really associated with the disease
4176192 there are no easy answers but there are simple answers we must have the courage to do what we know is morally right
4176193 obamas strategists should understand that the medium is often the message and used the olympics as an international stage to reinforce his popularity and the unique opportunity we have to elect a president who can lead our nation in the spirit of the olympics obamas olympics commercials could have and should have emphasized his leadership his belief in family his belief in himself and in our nation and world in very troubled times they could have reinforced that barack obama is the personification of the olympic spirit at the very time voters are most receptive to hearing that message they failed
4176194 do you really want to do that she was awfully hard on jack
4176195 helen didnt want to do it in her home and we were looking for a different house and hbo liked the idea
4176196 we decided to just have it be helen on helen and it was a real opportunity to speak with her
4176197 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4176198 she has a compelling personal story she was very determined to be a journalist at a young age
4176199 i think it is also the story of the role of journalism in america and the role of journalism in a democracy
4176200 i personally have great admiration for journalism and journalists there have been times in my life when it would have been nice to have more privacy
4176201 but it goes with the territory i think we all feel very lucky to have access to have people hear what we have to say
4176202 your decision to invade iraq has caused the deaths of thousands of americans and iraqis
4176203 every reason given has turned out not to be true my question is why did you really want to go to war
4176204 there is a blackout now i believe until the end of his term
4176205 i do share her analysis of what happened in the lead up to the war the press did not do their job adequately the press has changed over the past 30 years helen has remained true to her craft despite the shift
4176206 maybe irreverently most of the time bring them down to size
4176207 i never had the potential nobody made a pass at me darn it
4176208 i wanted a film that gives as much screen time to her her story and her take on things
4176209 there is a hope that there are journalists who will emerge and forge ahead and do that job i hope we will have more helen thomases

4176211 you always feel this happened under my watch and i should have done a better job

4176236 ive flown over it and looked down on dome shelter it was a real weird feeling to see it there i just thought wow ive got to get back up there soon
4176237 i dont worry about going more chance you could lose a leg driving down the road from the mountain
4176238 i have all this accumulated knowledge and experience and no one wants to employ it and im not sure why
4176239 that im of no further use to my country is why im considering australia that my former parliamentary colleagues seem not to want to appoint me to anything but are quite happy to accommodate others who have left or are about to so as to shut them up from whingeing from the sidelines in election year
4176240 politics was never my ambition i was coaxed into it by others
4176241 i always wanted to achieve in the entertainment industry that i succeeded in politics was as much a surprise to me as anyone
4176242 im too tarnished as a former transsexual politician to be taken any more seriously in entertainment than dancing with the stars
4176243 it seems that i am not valued for my experience in either local or central government so i guess i wasted 14 years of my life in publicly elected service and ended up unemployable
4176244 to be aware of the issue and pay particular attention to these faults
4176245 if it does get to a state of flaming or scalding if in any doubt call the fire service we do not know if there is a manufacturing fault a user fault or a dud batch but we want to give the public assurance we are trying to be responsible
4176246 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4176247 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4176250 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4176251 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4176252 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4176253 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4176254 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4176255 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4176256 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4176257 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4176258 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4176259 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4176260 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4176261 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4176262 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4176263 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4176264 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4176265 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4176266 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4176267 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4176268 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4176269 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4176270 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4176271 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4176272 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4176273 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4176274 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4176275 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4176276 whats an appropriate draw down rate what about inflation how do i budget for inevidable medical costs
4176277 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4176278 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4176279 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4176280 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4176281 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4176282 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4176283 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4176284 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4176285 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4176330 if i take an oath to do something and later on i find something else better than the first one then i do what is better and make expiation for my oath
4176331 o abdur rahman bin samura do not seek to be a ruler because if you are given authority for it then you will be held responsible for it but if you are given it without asking for it then you will be helped in it by allah and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first then do the better one and make expiation for your oath
4176332 by allah i will not provide you with mounts and i havent got anything to mount you on
4176333 by allah we will not be blessed as we came to the prophet asking him for mounts and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us so let us go back to the prophet and remind him of his oath
4176334 i did not give you mounts but it is allah who gave you by allah allah willing if i ever take an oath to do something and then i find something else than the first i will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath
4176335 we muslims are the last in the world but will be foremost on the day of resurrection
4176336 by allah if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family he commits a greater sin in allahs sight than that of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it
4176337 anyone who takes an oath through which his family may be harmed and insists on keeping it he surely commits a sin greater than that of dissolving his oath he should rather compensate for that oath by making expiation
4176338 if you people are criticizing usamas leadership you have already criticized the leadership of his father before but wa aimullah i e by allah he i e zaid deserved the leadership and he was one of the most beloved persons to me and now this his son usama is one of the dearest persons to me after him

4176341 o followers of muhammad by allah if you knew what i know you would weep much and laugh little

4176344 however now by allah you are dearer to me than my own self
4176345 o allahs apostle judge between us according to allahs laws
4176346 my son was a labourer serving this person and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife the people said that my son is to be stoned to death but i ransomed him with one hundred sheep and a slave girl then i asked the learned people who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will be exiled for one year and stoning will be the lot for the mans wife

4176348 do you think if the tribes of aslam ghifar muzaina and juhaina are better than the tribes of tamim amir bin sasaa ghatfan and asad they the second group are despairing and losing
4176349 by him in whose hand my soul is they the first group are better than them the second group
4176350 o allahs apostle this amount of zakat is for you and this other amount was given to me as a present
4176351 why didnt you stay at your fathers or mothers house and see if you would be given presents or not
4176352 now then what about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says this amount of zakat is for you and this amount was given to me as a present why didnt he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not by him in whose hand muhammads soul is none of you will steal anything of it i e zakat but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the day of resurrection if it has been a camel he will bring it over his neck while it will be grunting and if it has been a cow he will bring it over his neck while it will be mooing and if it has been a sheep he will bring it over his neck while it will be bleeding
4176353 then allahs apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits
4176354 by him in whose hand muhammads soul is if you know that which i know you would weep much and laugh little
4176355 they are the losers by the lord of the kaba they are the losers by the lord of the kaba
4176356 what is wrong with me is anything improper detected in me what is wrong with me then i sat beside him and he kept on saying his statement i could not remain quiet and allah knows in what sorrowful state i was at that time so i said who are they the losers let my father and mother be sacrificed for you o allahs apostle
4176357 they are the wealthy people except the one who does like this and like this and like this i e spends of his wealth in allahs cause
4176358 the prophet solomon once said tonight i will sleep with ninety women each of whom will bring forth a would be cavalier who will fight in allahs cause
4176359 by him in whose hand my soul is the handkerchiefs of sad in paradise are better than it
4176360 o allah s apostle before i embraced islam there was no family on the surface of the earth i wish to have degraded more than i did your family but today there is no family whom i wish to have honoured more than i did yours
4176361 i thought similarly by him in whose hand muhammads soul is
4176362 o allahs apostle my husband abu sufyan is a miser is it sinful of me to feed my children from his property
4176363 no unless you take it for your needs what is just and reasonable
4176364 will you be pleased to be one fourth of the people of paradise
4176365 wont you be pleased to be one third of the people of paradise
4176366 by him in whose hand muhammads soul is i hope that you will be one half of the people of paradise
4176367 by him in whose hand my soul is that sura no 112 equals one third of the quran
4176368 perform the bowing and the prostration properly with peace of mind for by him in whose hand my soul is i see you from behind my back when you bow and when you prostrate
4176369 by him in whose hand my soul is you are the most beloved people to me
4176370 lo allah forbids you to swear by your fathers so whoever has to take an oath he should swear by allah or keep quiet
4176371 allahs apostle said to me allah forbids you to swear by your
4176372 by allah since i heard that from the prophet i have not taken such an oath neither intentionally nor by reporting the oath of someone else
4176373 i have seen chickens eating dirty things so i deemed it filthy and took an oath that i would never eat chicken
4176374 whoever swears saying in his oath by al lat and aluzza should say none has the right to be worshipped but allah and whoever says to his friend come let me gamble with you should give something in charity
4176375 i used to wear this ring and keep its stone towards the palm of my hand
4176376 whoever swears by a religion other than islam is as he says and whoever commits suicide with something will be punished with the same thing in the hell fire and cursing a believer is like murdering him and whoever accuses a believer of disbelief then it is as if he had killed him
4176377 whatever allah takes is for him and whatever he gives is for him and everything with him has a limited fixed term in this world so she should be patient and hope for allahs reward
4176378 this is the mercy which allah has lodged in the hearts of whoever he wants of his slaves and verily allah is merciful only to those of his slaves who are merciful to others
4176379 any muslim who has lost three of his children will not be touched by the fire except that which will render allahs oath fulfilled
4176380 shall i tell you of the people of paradise they comprise every poor humble person and if he swears by allah to do something allah will fulfil it while the people of the fire comprise every violent cruel arrogant person
4176381 when we were young our elder friends used to prohibit us from taking
4176382 whoever swears falsely in order to grab the property of a muslim or of his brother allah will be angry with him when he meets him
4176383 this verse was revealed regarding me and a companion of mine when we had a dispute about a well
4176384 the hell fire will keep on saying are there anymore people to come till the lord of power and honour will put his foot over it and then it will say qat qat sufficient sufficient by your power and honour and its various sides will come close to each other i e it will contract
4176385 the prophet stood up saying is there anyone who can relieve me
4176386 allah forgives my followers those evil deeds their souls may whisper or suggest to them as long as they do not act on it or speak
4176387 i thought o allahs apostle such and such a thing was to be done before such and such a thing
4176388 o allahs apostle as regards these three acts of hajj thought so and so
4176389 do it do it and there is no harm therein
4176390 i have performed the tawaf round the kaba before the rami throwing pebbles at the jamra
4176391 i have slaughtered the sacrifice before the rami throwing pebbles at the jamra
4176392 go back and pray for you have not prayed the man went back and having prayed he
4176393 when you get up for the prayer perform the ablution properly and then face the qibla and say takbir allahu akbar and then recite of what you know of the quran and then bow and remain in this state till you feel at rest in bowing and then raise your head and stand straight and then prostrate till you feel at rest in prostration and then sit up till you feel at rest while sitting and then prostrate again till you feel at rest in prostration and then get up and stand straight and do all this in all your prayers
4176394 hudhaifa continued asking allah forgiveness for the killers of his father till he met allah till he died
4176395 if somebody eats something forgetfully while he is fasting then he should complete his fast for allah has made him eat and drink
4176396 o allahs apostle has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten
4176397 these two prostrations are to be performed by the person who does not know whether he has prayed more or less rakat in which case he should seek to follow what is right and then complete the rest of the prayer and perform two extra prostrations
4176398 moses said call me not to account for what i forget and be not hard upon me for my affair with you 18 73 the first excuse of moses was his forgetfulness
4176399 i have a young milch she goat which is better than two sheep for slaughtering
4176400 whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer should make up for it i e slaughter another animal and whoever has not slaughtered his sacrifice yet should slaughter it by mentioning allahs name over it
4176401 the biggest sins are to join others in worship with allah to be
4176402 if somebody is ordered by the ruler or the judge to take an oath and he takes a false oath in order to grab the property of a muslim then he will incur allahs wrath when he will meet him
4176403 you should give evidence i e witness otherwise the oath of your opponent will render your claim invalid
4176404 then he my opponent will take the oath o allahs apostle
4176405 whoever is ordered by the ruler or the judge to give an oath and he takes a false oath in order to grab the property of a muslim then he will incur allahs wrath when he meets him on the day of resurrection
4176406 tell your companions that allah or allahs apostle will provide you with mounts
4176407 by allah i will never give anything in charity to mistah after what he has said about aisha
4176408 yes by allah i like that allah should forgive me
4176409 by allah allah willing if ever i take an oath to do something and later on i find something else better than the first then i do the better one and give expiation for the dissolution of my oath
4176410 say la ilaha illallah a word with which i will be able to defend you before allah
4176411 following are two words sentences or utterances that are very easy for the tongue to say and very heavy in the balance of reward and the must beloved to the gracious almighty and they are subhan allah wa bi hamdihi subhan allahi l azim
4176412 whoever dies while he is setting up rivals along with allah i e worshipping others along with allah shall be admitted into the hell fire
4176413 whoever dies while he is not setting up rivals along with allah i e worshipping none except allah shall be admitted into paradise
4176414 o allahs apostle you took an oath for abstention from your wives for one month
4176415 abu usaid the companion of the prophet got married so he invited the prophet to his wedding party and the bride herself served them sahl said to the people do you know what drink she served him with she infused some dates in a pot at night and the next morning she served him with the infusion
4176416 i heard the voice of allahs apostle rather weak and i knew that it was because of hunger have you anything to present to the prophet
4176417 o um sulaim allahs apostle has come and we have no food to feed them
4176418 the reward of deeds depend upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended so whoever emigrated for the sake of allah and his apostle then his emigration will be considered to be for allah and his apostle and whoever emigrated for the sake of worldly gain or for a woman to marry then his emigration will be considered to be for what he emigrated for
4176419 as a proof of my true repentance for not joining the holy battle of tabuk i shall give up all my property for the sake of allah and his apostle as an expiation for that sin
4176420 keep some of your wealth for that is better for you
4176421 i smell in you the bad smell of maghafir a bad smelling raisin have you eaten maghafir
4176422 no but i have drunk honey in the house of zainab bint jahsh and i will never drink it again
4176423 i will not drink anymore and i have taken an oath so do not inform anybody of that
4176424 it a vow does not prevent anything that has to take place but the property of a miser is spent taken out with it
4176425 allah says the vow does not bring about for the son of adam anything i have not decreed for him but his vow may coincide with what has been decided for him and by this way i cause a miser to spend of his wealth so he gives me spends in charity for the fulfilment of what has been decreed for him what he would not give me before but for his vow
4176426 the prophet said the best of you people are my generation and the second best will be those who will follow them and then those who will follow the second generation
4176427 i do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his
4176428 whoever vows that he will be obedient to allah should remain obedient to him and whoever made a vow that he will disobey allah should not disobey him
4176429 o allahs apostle i vowed to perform itikaf for one night in al masjid al haram
4176430 my sister vowed to perform the hajj but she died before fulfilling it
4176431 would you not have paid her debts if she had any
4176432 so pay allahs rights as he is more entitled to receive his rights
4176433 whoever vowed to be obedient to allah must be obedient to him and whoever vowed to be disobedient to allah should not be disobedient to him
4176434 allah is not in need of this man torturing himself
4176435 it is abu israil who has vowed that he will stand and never sit down and he will never come in the shade nor speak to anybody and will fast
4176436 order him to speak and let him come in the shade and make him sit down but let him complete his fast
4176437 allah has ordered the vows to be fulfilled and we are forbidden to fast on the day of nahr
4176438 no by him in whose hand my soul is for the sheet which he stole from the war booty before its distribution on the day of khaibar is now burning over him
4176439 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4176440 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4176441 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4176442 is it as great as everyones expectations i guess were going to have to wait and see

4176444 spin like this reveals that they are more interested in grabbing headlines in the short term than solving the problem in the long term
4176445 the press release is accurate because the scheme is based in south tyneside
4176446 it does not suggest that all 3 800 people have been found jobs in south tyneside just that the project is based there
4176447 i sent this letter to the president because i am impatient for action on this issue
4176448 congress is working to broadly and smartly reform our existing intellectual property laws but its doubtful any reform will become final before the end of this year when american innovation and jobs are at stake i firmly believe that the federal government should do all it can as quickly as it can thats why ive asked the president to take these actions now
4176449 manufacturers in indiana and across the country have lost an estimated 750 000 jobs and 250 billion in revenue because of this theft our foreign competitors are cheating this needs to stop and our government needs to aggressively act to put an end to this fraudulent behavior
4176450 i am very pleased to announce this important crime fighting grant for the county
4176451 we are blessed by having many dedicated law enforcement officers and prosecuters who work to make our communities safer this new dna lab is another important tool to support their efforts to fight crime and increase public safety im proud to support them in this effort
4176452 the man i want to sit behind the big desk and make those decisions in the oval office is john mccain
4176453 people are starting to look at mccain and see how hes a real guy with real answers
4176454 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4176455 i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4176456 with obama in the white house much of the world would likely become a tyrants playground
4176457 the partnership between the scottish f a and diadora has grown with each new kit produced for the national team utilising all of our design technologies and expertise in the technical apparel business which has seen in our opinion some of the greatest kits produced in the modern game following the near qualification in the recent european championships and previous success of the home away and 3rd kits weve had a challenge to produce a product suitable for the players staff and fans alike to a level to which they have come accustomed too and most importantly deserve but we have weve researched the history heritage and requirements of the team to design a new home kit which we hope will inspire the team to great performances in the forthcoming world cup qualifying campaign and see them into the finals in south africa 2010
4176458 representing your country is one of the proudest achievements any scottish footballer can ever hope to achieve you can scale the heights of club football but the feeling you get when you pull on that famous dark blue jersey is almost impossible to beat diadora have really done their homework with this new kit it has all the hallmarks of the great scotland strips of old and i know that it will help inspire the current generation of stars as we set out on the road to south africa the fans are going to love it
4176459 dear emmanuel i am writing on behalf of myself a loyal arsenal supporter and the other loyal arsenal supporters named at the end of this letter we would very much appreciate it if you could take the time to read this letter and reply in person we have been very disappointed by you and your agents behaviour this summer we appreciate that you had a good season for us last year but you are under contract to arsenal and should have shown more respect to your contract you could have gone about gaining a pay rise in a more respectful and professional manner by speaking directly to the club and not by leaking quotes and stories to the media we are happy to forgive and forget your behaviour on one condition that condition being that you issue a formal apology to the club your fellow arsenal players and the fans for your behaviour this summer if you do not apologise then i will not jeer or boo you however i will not be able to support with the same passion that i once did having observed your behaviour this summer yours sincerely
4176460 although the strikers scored four goals between them they could easily have had another four each but well work on that
4176461 i thought they could have scored more goals and it should have been a higher score
4176462 that wont happen against harder teams so weve got to work on things
4176463 having said that you cant complain about winning 5 2 so im quite content with the start we had
4176464 we switched off and there was bad marking but the players admitted it so hopefully theyve learned their lesson three points was the main thing
4176465 well have to work on a lot of things yet to get where we want to be but well get there
4176466 the results went with us on saturday and we got three points which was the main thing at the end of the day
4176467 ive said over the past two or three years that if you can win your first six or seven games its a big bonus
4176468 the confidence comes in and youre winning games and teams are trying to catch you up so its important to win at least the first five or six which is not easy to do
4176469 we have competition for places in every position and theyve got to put the performance in or they dont play

4176503 nosotros entendemos que el programa de vuelos de spanair se va a mantener en un 85 por ciento que se traducir n en unos 250 vuelos diarios a 43 destinos

4176512 this new gao report is a reaffirmation of the brac recommendations to consolidate missions at aberdeen proving ground
4176513 the gao report provides assurance that plans are in place to support the smoothest possible transition of the missions and jobs from
4176514 this brac decision has now been addressed in multiple reports as well as in congressional hearings and we continue to see that the
4176515 this most recent gao report indicates that many of the key challenges we are facing are consistent with those of other 2005 brac decisions it provides a clear analysis of the key challenges being faced by this move allowing us to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to safeguard its rapid implementation in the most effective and efficient manner possible including the armys ability to directly hire employees establish necessary infrastructure and secure proper funding
4176516 the 2005 brac recommendations will bring both opportunities and challenges to our state but will ultimately make both our military and our region stronger
4176517 team maryland is diligently working together to ensure a smooth transition as more jobs move from new jersey to maryland through the brac process the gao study proves that maryland is at the ready to support the warfighter and make sure there is no disruption in their mission

4176524 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players
4176525 it is also probably one of the worst offences by any manager in the premier league to date and is unbelievably hypocritical given his recent comments in respect of cristiano ronaldo and real madrid as a result we have today made an official complaint to the pl about the conduct of manchester united
4176526 todays public comments by manchester uniteds manager announcing that he has made an offer for dimitar and is confident that the deal will go through with time working in their favour is a blatant example of sheer arrogance and interference with one of our players

4176539 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win

4176545 he might not focus as much on class if his parent wasnt there
4176546 by high school my parents knew i could control myself and only do homework

4176550 people in china especially parents and college students are suddenly becoming aware of huge depression and anxiety problems in young people
4176551 the media report on new campus suicides all the time
4176552 in this generation every child is raised to be at the top
4176553 theyve worked hard for it and its what their parents have focused their lives on but the problem is that the country cant provide the lifestyle they feel they deserve only a few will get it
4176554 because of the cultural revolution my parents literally wasted 10 years
4176555 i was explicitly told that they had lost a lot in their lives so they wanted me to get it back for them
4176556 in china the term for a one child family is a risky family
4176557 if something happened to that child it would be a disaster so from the parents point of view the spoiling is all necessary to protect them
4176558 does this mean everything i have would have to be cut in half or shared no i dont want that
4176559 the only way only children are reliably different from others is they score slightly higher in academic achievement
4176560 pinning their problems on having no siblings is really making them a scapegoat
4176561 these kids have the same dreams as all middle class kids to go to college to get white collar jobs to own their own home to have nikes and name brands
4176562 they expect things that are normal in developed countries but by chinas standards are unheard of
4176563 it was after they got a bad grade on a test
4176564 they think to die is better than to have that bad mark
4176565 that one grade becomes the only standard to justify you as a person
4176566 if you have a good personality or maybe youre good in math but not chinese all of that is your downfall because its all about your grade
4176567 but all the other students do the extra homework so if you do not do it you will lag behind
4176568 with the click of a button they go from a 19 year old with no social life to a great warrior in world of warcraft
4176569 why bother doing things in the real world when they can be in this game and be fulfilled
4176570 they have trouble adjusting to the idea that theyre going to be working class
4176571 its not like american universities where you have many friends
4176572 at chinese universities you compete for limited resources and everyone is concerned about themselves and if you wanted to talk to your parents they wouldnt understand when they were your age they were reading maos little red book
4176573 in the 20th century the term depression didnt even exist in china
4176574 it couldnt be talked about because there was no vocabulary for it yet
4176575 back then every mental problem was seen as anti socialist
4176576 if you were depressed they thought you were politically impure and sent you to a labor camp
4176577 people in china have more knowledge about mental health today
4176578 now there are books and popular magazines about it and the training infrastructure gets better all the time
4176579 on your resum you cant put 1988 to 2001 studied 10 hours every day
4176580 that would otherwise take millions of dollars and years of time at zero cost
4176581 tell me if thats a good value proposition or not
4176582 convincing thousands of money managers to go into the web site and answer hundreds of questions about who they are
4176583 were a hispanic and woman owned firm were unique in that sense
4176584 so in a way we have the responsibility of being pioneers and showing that these things can be done this is a market that hispanics have not usually penetrated often not getting the training nor apprenticeship opportunities
4176585 its important that the younger generation sees us doing this and doing it very well
4176586 the problem with michael phelps is theres no competition where he is
4176587 if he came to where im from which is the inner city liberty city i was the three times charles hadly school champ some of the best people in the world are the people who arent able to make it to that level
4176588 where im from liberty city i know a couple of people that could beat michael phelps right now
4176589 you are going to a nation from the people of the scripture so let the first thing to which you will invite them be the tauhid of allah if they learn that tell them that allah has enjoined on them five prayers to be offered in one day and one night and if they pray tell them that allah has enjoined on them zakat of their properties and it is to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor and if they agree to that then take from them zakat but avoid the best property of the people
4176590 o muadh do you know what allahs right upon his slaves is
4176591 to worship him allah alone and to join none in worship with him allah do you know what their right upon him is
4176592 by him in whose hand my life is it is equal to one third of the quran
4176593 i do so because it mentions the qualities of the beneficent and i love to recite it in my prayer
4176594 allah will not be merciful to those who are not merciful to mankind
4176595 go back and tell her that whatever allah takes is his and whatever he gives is his and everything with him has a limited fixed term in this world so order her to be patient and hope for allahs reward
4176596 this is mercy which allah has put in the heart of his slaves and allah bestows his mercy only on those of his slaves who are merciful to others
4176597 none is more patient than allah against the harmful and
4176598 the keys of the unseen are five and none knows them but allah 1 none knows what is in the womb but allah 2 none knows what will happen tomorrow but allah 3 none knows when it will rain but allah 4 none knows where he will die but allah knows that 5 and none knows when the hour will be established but allah
4176599 if anyone tells you that muhammad has seen his lord he is a liar for allah
4176600 allah himself is as salam name of allah so you should say at tahiyatu lil laihi was sala watu
4176601 on the day of resurrection allah will hold the whole earth and fold
4176602 i seek refuge with you by your izzat none has the right to be worshipped but you who does not die while the jinns and the human beings die
4176603 the people will be thrown into hell fire and it will keep on saying is there any more till the lord of the worlds puts his foot over it whereupon its different sides will come close to each other and it will say qad qad enough enough by your izzat honour and power and your karam generosity paradise will remain spacious enough to accommodate more people until allah will create some more people and let them dwell in the superfluous space of paradise
4176604 o allah all the praises are for you you are the lord of the heavens and the earth all the praises are for you you are the maintainer of the heaven and the earth and whatever is in them all the praises are for you you are the light of the heavens and the earth your word is the truth and your promise is the truth and the meeting with you is the truth and paradise is the truth and the hell fire is the truth and the hour is the truth o allah i surrender myself to you and i believe in you and i depend upon you and i repent to you and with you your evidences i stand against my opponents and to you i leave the judgment for those who refuse my message o allah forgive me my sins that i did in the past or will do in the future and also the sins i did in secret or in public you are my only god whom i worship and there is no other god for me i e i worship none but you
4176605 you are the truth and your word is the truth
4176606 dont trouble yourselves too much you are not calling a deaf or an absent person but you are calling one who hears sees and is very near
4176607 la hawla wala quwwatta illa billah there is neither might nor power but with allah
4176608 o abdullah bin qais say la hawla wala quwwata illa billah there is neither might nor power but with allah for it is one of the treasures of paradise
4176609 o allahs apostle teach me an invocation with which i may invoke allah in my prayers
4176610 say o allah i have wronged my soul very much oppressed myself and none forgives the sins but you so please bestow your forgiveness upon me no doubt you are the oft forgiving most merciful
4176611 gabriel called me and said allah has heard the statement of your people
4176612 allah has ninety nine names one hundred less one and he who memorized them all by heart will enter paradise
4176613 when anyone of you goes to bed he should dust it off thrice with the edge of his garment and say bismika rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfahu in amsakta nafsi faghfir laha wa in arsaltaha fahfazha bima tahfaz bihi ibadaka s salihin
4176614 alhamdu lillahi al ladhi ahyana bada ma amatana wa ilaihi n nushur
4176615 alhamdu lillahi al ladhi ahyana bada ma amatana wa ilaihi n nushur
4176616 if anyone of you when intending to have a sexual relation sleep with his wife says bismillah allahumma jannibna ashshaitan wa jannib ash shaitana ma razaqtana satan would never harm that child should it be ordained that they will have one because of that sleep
4176617 i send off for a game my trained hunting dogs what is your verdict concerning the game they hunt
4176618 if you send off your trained hunting dogs and mention the name of allah then if they catch some game eat thereof and if you hit the game with a mirad a hunting tool and it wounds it you can eat it
4176619 o allahs apostle here are people who have recently embraced islam and they bring meat and we do not know whether they had mentioned allahs name while slaughtering the animals or not
4176620 whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before offering prayer should slaughter another animal in place of the first and whoever has not yet slaughtered any should slaughter a sacrifice and mention allahs name while doing so
4176621 do not swear by your fathers and whoever wants to swear should swear by allah
4176622 i dont care if i am killed as a muslim on any side of my body i may be killed in allahs cause for that is for the sake of allahs very self and if he will he will bestow his blessings upon the torn pieces of my body
4176623 there is none having a greater sense of ghira than allah and for that reason he has forbidden shameful deeds and sins illegal sexual intercourse etc and there is none who likes to be praised more than allah does
4176624 when allah created the creation he wrote in his book and he
4176625 allah says i am just as my slave thinks i am i e i am able to do for
4176626 allah is not hidden from you he is not one eyed
4176627 while al masih ad dajjal is blind in the right eye and his eye looks like a protruding grape
4176628 allah did not send any prophet but that he warned his nation of the one eyed liar ad dajjal he is one eyed while your lord is not one eyed the word kafir unbeliever is written between his two eyes
4176629 it is better that you should not do it for allah has written whom he is going to create till the day of resurrection
4176630 i heard abu said saying that the prophet said no soul is ordained to be created but allah will create it
4176631 allah will gather the believers on the day of resurrection in the same way
4176632 but you d better go to noah as he was the first apostle sent by allah to the people of the
4176633 there will come out of hell fire everyone who says la ilaha illal lah and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a barley grain then there will come out of hell fire everyone who says la ilaha illal lah and has in his heart good equal to the weight of a wheat grain then there will come out of hell fire everyone who says la ilaha illal lah and has in his heart good equal to the weight of an atom or a smallest ant
4176634 allahs hand is full and its fullness is not affected by the continuous spending day and night
4176635 do you see what he has spent since he created the heavens and the earth yet all that has not decreased what is in his hand
4176636 his throne is over the water and in his other hand is the balance of justice and he raises and lowers whomever he will
4176637 on the day of resurrection allah will grasp the whole earth by his hand and all the heavens in his right and then he will say i am the king
4176638 on that allahs apostle smiled till his premolar teeth became visible and then recited
4176639 no just estimate have they made of allah such as due to
4176640 if i saw a man with my wife i would strike him behead him with the blade of my sword
4176641 you people are astonished at sads ghira by allah i have more ghira than he and allah has more ghira than i and because of allahs ghira he has made unlawful shameful deeds and sins illegal sexual intercourse etc done in open and in secret and there is none who likes that the people should repent to him and beg his pardon than allah and for this reason he sent the warners and the givers of good news and there is none who likes to be praised more than allah does and for this reason allah promised to grant paradise to the doers of good
4176642 yes such and such sura and such and such sura
4176643 you have given us the good news now give us something
4176644 there was allah and nothing else before him and his throne was over the water and he then created the heavens and the earth and wrote everything in the book
4176645 the right hand of allah is full and its fullness is not affected by the continuous spending night and day do you see what he has spent since he created the heavens and the earth yet all that has not decreased what is in his right hand his throne is over the water and in his other hand is the bounty or the power to bring about death and he raises some people and brings others down
4176646 if allahs apostle were to conceal anything of the quran he would have concealed this verse
4176647 you were given in marriage by your families while i was married to the prophet by allah from over seven heavens
4176648 the verse but o muhammad you did hide in your heart that which allah was about to make manifest you did fear the people 33 37 was revealed in connection with zainab and zaid bin haritha
4176649 when allah had finished his creation he wrote over his throne my
4176650 whoever believes in allah and his apostle offers prayers perfectly and fasts the month of ramadan then it is incumbent upon allah to admit him into paradise whether he emigrates for allahs cause or stays in the land where he was born
4176651 o allahs apostle should we not inform the people of that
4176652 there are one hundred degrees in paradise which allah has prepared for those who carry on jihad in his cause the distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and the earth so if you ask allah for anything ask him for the firdaus for it is the last part of paradise and the highest part of paradise and at its top there is the throne of beneficent and from it gush forth the rivers of paradise
4176653 o abu dharr do you know where this sun goes
4176654 it goes and asks permission to prostrate and it is allowed and one day it as if being ordered to return whence it came then it will rise from the west
4176655 the people will fall unconscious on the day of resurrection then suddenly i will see moses holding one of the pillars of the throne
4176656 i will be the first person to be resurrected and will see moses holding the throne
4176657 a group of angels stay with you at night and another group of
4176658 in what state did you leave my slaves the angels reply when we left them they were praying and when
4176659 if somebody gives in charity something equal to a date from his honestly earned money for nothing ascends to allah except good then allah will take it in his right hand and bring it up for its owner as anyone of you brings up a baby horse till it becomes like a mountain
4176660 he gives to the chiefs of najd and leaves us
4176661 i just wanted to attract and unite their hearts make them firm in islam
4176662 out of the offspring of this man there will be people who will recite the quran but it will not go beyond their throats and they will go out of islam as an arrow goes out through the game and they will kill the muslims and leave the idolaters should i live till they appear i would kill them as the killing of the nation of ad
4176663 you people will see your lord as you see this full moon and you will have no trouble in seeing him so if you can avoid missing through sleep or business etc a prayer before sunrise fajr and a prayer before sunset asr you must do so
4176664 you will definitely see your lord with your own eyes
4176665 you will see your lord on the day of resurrection as you see this full moon and you will have no difficulty in seeing him
4176666 o allahs apostle shall we see our lord on the day of resurrection
4176667 do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night
4176668 do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun when there are no clouds
4176669 so those hooks look like the thorns of but none knows how big they are except allah those hooks will snap the people away according to their deeds some of the people will stay in hell be destroyed because of their evil deeds and some will be cut or torn by the hooks and fall into hell and some will be punished and then relieved when allah has finished his judgments among the people he will take whomever he will out of hell through his mercy he will then order the angels to take out of the fire all those who used to worship none but allah from among those whom allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified in the world that none has the right to be worshipped but allah the angels will recognize them in the fire by the marks of prostration on their foreheads for the fire will eat up all the human body except the mark caused by prostration as allah has forbidden the fire to eat the mark of prostration they will come out of the hell fire completely burnt and then the water of life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the mud of the torrent then allah will finish the judgments among the people and there will remain one man facing the hell fire and he will be the last person among the people of hell to enter paradise he will say o my lord please turn my face away from the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me so he will invoke allah in the way allah will wish him to invoke and then allah will say to him if i grant you that will you then ask for anything else he will reply no by your power honour i will not ask you for anything else he will give his lord whatever promises and covenants allah will demand so allah will turn his face away from hell fire when he will face paradise and will see it he will remain quiet for as long as allah will wish him to remain quiet then he will say o my lord bring me near to the gate of paradise allah will say to him didnt you give your promises and covenants that you would never ask for anything more than what you had been given woe on you o adams son how treacherous you are he will say o my lord and will keep on invoking allah till he says to him if i give what you are asking will you then ask for anything else he will reply no by your honour power i will not ask for anything else then he will give covenants and promises to allah and then allah will bring him near to the gate of paradise when he stands at the gate of paradise paradise will be opened and spread before him and he will see its splendour and pleasures whereupon he will remain quiet as long as allah will wish him to remain quiet and then he will say o my lord admit me into paradise allah will say didnt you give your covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been given allah will say woe on you o adams son how treacherous you are the man will say o my lord do not make me the most miserable of your creation and he will keep on invoking allah till allah will laugh because of his sayings and when allah will laugh because of him he will say to him enter paradise and when he will enter it allah will say to him wish for anything so he will ask his lord and he will wish for a great number of things for allah himself will remind him to wish for certain things by saying wish for so and so when there is nothing more to wish for allah will say this is for you and its equal is for you as well
4176670 i testify that i remember the prophet saying that is
4176671 that man will be the last person of the people of paradise to enter paradise
4176672 o allahs apostle shall we see our lord on the day of resurrection
4176673 do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear
4176674 so you will have no difficulty in seeing your lord on that day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon in a clear sky
4176675 what did you use to worship they will reply we used to worship ezra the son of allah it will be said to them you are liars for allah has neither a wife nor a son what do you want now they will reply we want you to provide us with water then it will be said to them drink and they will fall down in hell instead then it will be said to the christians what did you use to worship they will reply we used to worship messiah the son of allah it will be said you are liars for allah has neither a wife nor a son what do you want now they will say we want you to provide us with water it will be said to them drink and they will fall down in hell instead when there remain only those who used to worship allah alone both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones it will be said to them what keeps you here when all the people have gone they will say we parted with them in the world when we were in greater need of them than we are today we heard the call of one proclaiming let every nation follow what they used to worship and now we are waiting for our lord then the almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time and he will say i am your lord and they will say you are not our lord and none will speak to him then but the prophets and then it will be said to them do you know any sign by which you can recognize him they will say the shin and so allah will then uncover his shin whereupon every believer will prostrate before him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation these people will try to prostrate but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood and they will not be able to prostrate then the bridge will be laid across hell
4176676 it is a slippery bridge on which there are clamps and hooks like a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends such a thorny seed is found in najd and is called some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye some others as quick as lightning a strong wind fast horses or she camels so some will be safe without any harm some will be safe after receiving some scratches and some will fall down into hell fire the last person will cross by being dragged over the bridge
4176677 you muslims cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with almighty for their muslim brothers on that day when they see themselves safe they will say o allah save our brothers for they used to pray with us fast with us and also do good deeds with us allah will say go and take out of hell anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one gold dinar allah will forbid the fire to burn the faces of those sinners they will go to them and find some of them in hell fire up to their feet and some up to the middle of their legs so they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return and allah will say to them go and take out of hell anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half dinar they will take out whomever they will recognize and return and then allah will say go and take out of hell anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom or a smallest ant and so they will take out all those whom they will recognize
4176678 then the prophets and angels and the believers will intercede and last
4176679 the believers will be kept waiting on the day of resurrection so long that
4176680 let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our lord so that he may relieve us from our place then they will go to adam and say you are adam the father of the people allah created you with his own hand and made you reside in his paradise and ordered his angels to prostrate before you and taught you the names of all things will you intercede for us with your lord so that he may relieve us from this place of ours adam will say i am not fit for this undertaking he will mention his mistakes he had committed i e his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so he will add go to noah the first prophet sent by allah to the people of the earth the people will go to noah who will say i am not fit for this undertaking he will mention his mistake which he had done i e his asking his lord without knowledge he will say to them go to abraham khalil ar rahman they will go to abraham who will say i am not fit for this undertaking he would mention three words by which he told a lie and say to them go to moses a slave whom allah gave the torah and spoke to directly and brought near him for conversation they will go to moses who will say i am not fit for this undertaking he will mention his mistake he made i e killing a person and will say to them go to jesus allahs slave and his apostle and a soul created by him and his word be and it was they will go to jesus who will say i am not fit for this undertaking but youd better go to muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been forgiven by allah so they will come to me and i will ask my lords permission to enter his house and then i will be permitted when i see him i will fall down in prostration before him and he will leave me in prostration as long as he will and then he will say o muhammad lift up your head and speak for you will be listened to and intercede for your intercession will be accepted and ask for anything for it will be granted then i will raise my head and glorify my lord with certain praises which he has taught me allah will put a limit for me to intercede for a certain type of people i will take them out and make them enter paradise
4176681 so i will raise my head and glorify and praise him as he has taught me then i will intercede and he will put a limit for me to intercede for a certain type of people i will take them out and let them enter paradise
4176682 so i will go out and take them out of hell fire and let them enter paradise till none will remain in the fire except those whom quran will imprison i e those who are destined for eternal life in the fire
4176683 it may be that your lord will raise you to a station of praise and glory 17 79 the narrator
4176684 be patient till you meet allah and his apostle and i will be on the lake tank al kauthar
4176685 o allah our lord all the praises are for you you are the keeper establisher or the one who looks after of the heavens and the earth all the praises are for you you are the light of the heavens and the earth and whatever is therein you are the truth and your saying is the truth and your promise is the truth and the meeting with you is the truth and paradise is the truth and the hell fire is the truth o allah i surrender myself to you and believe in you and i put my trust in you solely depend upon and to you i complain of my opponents and with your evidence i argue so please forgive the sins which i have done in the past or i will do in the future and also those sins which i did in secret or in public and that which you know better than i none has the right to be worshipped but you
4176686 there will be none among you but his lord will speak to him and there will be no interpreter between them nor a screen to screen him
4176687 there will be two paradises of silver and all the utensils and whatever is therein will be of silver and two paradises of gold and its utensils and whatever therein will be of gold and there will be nothing to prevent the people from seeing their lord except the cover of majesty over his face in the paradise of eden eternal bliss
4176688 whoever takes the property of a muslim by taking a false oath will meet allah who will be angry with him
4176689 there are three types of persons to whom allah will neither speak
4176690 time has come back to its original state which it had when allah created the heavens and the earth the year is twelve months of which four are sacred and out of these four three are in succession namely dhul hijja and muharram and the fourth one rajab mudar which is between jumad ath tham and shaban
4176691 isnt it the day of an nahr slaughtering of sacrifices
4176692 and your honour are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours you shall meet your lord and he will ask you about your deeds beware dont go astray after me by striking the necks of one another lo it is incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the informed one might comprehend it understand it better than some of the present audience
4176693 no doubt havent i conveyed allahs message to you no doubt havent i conveyed allahs message to you
4176694 what ever allah takes is for him and whatever he gives is for him and everything has a limited fixed term in this world so she should be patient and hope for allahs reward
4176695 allah is merciful only to those of his slaves who are merciful to others
4176696 paradise and hell fire quarrelled in the presence of their lord
4176697 some people who will be scorched by hell fire as a punishment for sins they have committed and then allah will admit them into paradise by the grant of his mercy these people will be called al jahannamiyylin the people of hell
4176698 no just estimate have they made of allah such as due to him 39 67
4176699 when allah created the creations he wrote with him on his throne my mercy has preceded my anger
4176700 the creation of everyone of you starts with the process of collecting the material for his body within forty days and forty nights in the womb of his mother then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period 40 days and then he becomes like a piece of flesh for a similar period then an angel is sent to him by allah and the angel is allowed ordered to write four things his livelihood his date of death his deeds and whether he will be a wretched one or a blessed one in the hereafter and then the soul is breathed into him so one of you may do good deeds characteristic of the people of paradise so much that there is nothing except a cubit between him and paradise but then what has been written for him decides his behaviour and he starts doing evil deeds characteristic of the people of hell fire and ultimately enters hell fire and one of you may do evil deeds characteristic of the people of hell fire so much so that there is nothing except a cubit between him and hell fire then what has been written for him decides his behaviour and he starts doing good deeds characteristic of the people of paradise and ultimately enters paradise
4176701 o gabriel what prevents you from visiting us more often than you do
4176702 allah guarantees to the person who carries out jihad for his cause and nothing compelled him to go out but the jihad in his cause and belief in his words that he will either admit him into paradise or return him with his reward or the booty he has earned to his residence from where he went out
4176703 a man fights for pride and haughtiness another fights for bravery and another fights for showing off which of these cases is in allahs cause
4176704 the one who fights that allahs word islam should be superior fights in allahs cause
4176705 some people from my followers will continue to be victorious over others till allahs order the hour is established
4176706 a group of my followers will keep on following allahs laws strictly and they will not be harmed by those who will disbelieve them or stand against them till allahs order the hour will come while they will be in that state
4176707 if you ask me for this piece of palm leaf stalk even then i would not give it to you you cannot avoid what allah has ordained for you and if you turn away from islam allah will surely ruin you
4176708 do not ask him lest he would say something that you hate
4176709 they ask you concerning the spirit say the spirit its knowledge is with my lord and of knowledge you mankind have been given only a little
4176710 allah guarantees the person who carries out jihad in his cause and nothing compelled him to go out but jihad in his cause and the belief in his word that he will either admit him into paradise martyrdom or return him with reward or booty he has earned to his residence from where he went out
4176711 whenever anyone of you invoke allah for something he should be firm in his asking and he should not say if you wish give me for none can compel allah to do something against his will
4176712 o allahs apostle our souls are in the hand of allah and when he wishes to bring us to life he does
4176713 the example of a believer is that of a fresh green plant the leaves of which move in whatever direction the wind forces them to move and when the wind becomes still it stand straight such is the similitude of the believer he is disturbed by calamities but is like the fresh plant he regains his normal state soon and the example of a disbeliever is that of a pine tree which remains hard and straight till allah cuts it down when he will
4176714 the remaining period of your stay on the earth in comparison to the nations before you is like the period between the asr prayer and sunset the people of the torah were given the torah and they acted upon it till midday and then they were worn out and were given for their labor one qirat each then the people of the gospel were given the gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the asr prayer and then they were worn out and were given for their labour one qirat each then you people were given the quran and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two qirats each double the reward of the previous nations
4176715 i take your pledge on the condition that you 1 will not join partners in worship with allah 2 will not steal 3 will not commit illegal sexual intercourse 4 will not kill your offspring 5 will not slander 6 and will not disobey me when i order you to do good whoever among you will abide by his pledge his reward will be with allah and whoever commits any of those sins and receives the punishment in this world that punishment will be an expiation for his sins and purification but if allah screens him then it will be up to allah to punish him if he will or excuse him if he will
4176716 tonight i will have sexual relation sleep with all my wives so that each of them will become pregnant and bring forth a boy who will grow into a cavalier and will fight in allahs cause
4176717 if solomon had said if allah will then each of those women would have delivered a would be cavalier to fight in allahs cause
4176718 dont worry tahur i e your illness will be a means of cleansing of your sins if allah will
4176719 tahur no but it is a fever that is burning in the body of an old man and it will make him visit his grave
4176720 allah captured your souls made you sleep when he willed and returned them to your bodies when he willed
4176721 a man from the muslims and a man from the jews quarrelled and the muslim said
4176722 do not give me superiority over moses for the people will fall unconscious on the day of resurrection i will be the first to regain consciousness and behold moses will be standing there holding the side of the throne i will not know whether he has been one of those who have fallen unconscious and then regained consciousness before me or if he has been one of those exempted by allah from falling unconscious
4176723 ad dajjal will come to medina and find the angels guarding it if allah will neither ad dajjal nor plague will be able to come near it
4176724 for every prophet there is one invocation which is definitely fulfilled by allah and i wish if allah will to keep my that special invocation as to be the intercession for my followers on the day of resurrection
4176725 while i was sleeping i saw myself in a dream standing by a well i
4176726 intercede for him and you will be rewarded for that and allah will fulfil what he will through his apostles tongue
4176727 none of you should say o allah forgive me if you wish or bestow your mercy on me if you wish or provide me with means of subsistence if you wish but he should be firm in his request for allah does what he will and nobody can force him to do anything
4176728 if allah will tomorrow we will encamp in khaif bani kinana the
4176729 when allah ordains something on the heaven the angels beat with
4176730 until when the fear is banished from their hearts the angels say what was it that your lord said they reply he has said the truth and he is the most high the great
4176731 allah never listens to anything as he listens to the prophet reciting quran in a pleasant sweet sounding voice
4176732 allah will say on the day of resurrection o adam adam
4176733 if allah loves a person he calls gabriel saying allah loves so and so o gabriel love him so gabriel would love him and then would make an announcement in the heavens allah has loved so and so therefore you should love him also so all the dwellers of the heavens would love him and then he is granted the pleasure of the people on the earth
4176734 there are angels coming to you in succession at night and others
4176735 o so and so whenever you go to your bed for sleeping say o allah i have surrendered myself over to you and have turned my face towards you and leave all my affairs to you and depend on you and put my trust in you expecting your reward and fearing your punishment there is neither fleeing from you nor refuge but with you i believe in the book quran which you have revealed and in your prophet muhammad whom you have sent if you then die on that night then you will die as a muslim and if you wake alive in the morning then you will receive the reward
4176736 o allah the revealer of the holy book the quick taker of accounts defeat the clans and shake them
4176737 allah said the fast is for me and i will give the reward for it as he the one who observes the fast leaves his sexual desire food and drink for my sake fasting is a screen from hell and there are two pleasures for a fasting person one at the time of breaking his fast and the other at the time when he will meet his lord and the smell of the mouth of a fasting person is better in allahs sight than the smell of musk
4176738 once while job aiyub was taking a bath in a naked state suddenly
4176739 every night when it is the last third of the night our lord the superior the blessed descends to the nearest heaven and says is there anyone to invoke me that i may respond to his invocation is there anyone to ask me so that i may grant him his request is there anyone asking my forgiveness so that i may forgive him
4176740 we muslims are the last to come but will be the foremost on the day of resurrection
4176741 here is khadija coming to you with a dish of food or a tumbler containing something to drink convey to her a greeting from her lord allah and give her the glad tidings that she will have a palace in paradise built of qasab wherein there will be neither any noise nor any fatigue trouble
4176742 but by allah i did not think that allah to confirm
4176743 allah created the creation and when he finished from his creation
4176744 would you be pleased that i will keep good relation with the one who will keep good relation with you and i will sever the relation with the one who will sever the relation with you it said yes o my lord allah said to it that is for you
4176745 would you then if you were given the authority do mischief in the land and sever your ties of kinship
4176746 allah said if my slaves loves the meeting with me i too love the
4176747 allah said i am to my slave as he thinks of me i e i am able to
4176748 a man who never did any good deed said that if he died his family should burn him and throw half the ashes of his burnt body in the earth and the other half in the sea for by allah if allah should get hold of him he would inflict such punishment on him as he would not inflict on anybody among the people but allah ordered the sea to collect what was in it of his ashes and similarly ordered the earth to collect what was in it of his ashes then allah said to the recreated man why did you do so the man replied for being afraid of you and you know it very well so allah forgave him
4176749 if somebody commits a sin and then says o my lord i have sinned please forgive me and his lord says my slave has known that he has a lord who forgives sins and punishes for it i therefore have forgiven my slave his sins then he remains without committing any sin for a while and then again commits another sin and says o my lord i have committed another sin please forgive me and allah says my slave has known that he has a lord who forgives sins and punishes for it i therefore have forgiven my slave his sin then he remains without committing any another sin for a while and then commits another sin for the third time and says o my lord i have committed another sin please forgive me and allah says my slave has known that he has a lord who forgives sins and punishes for it i therefore have forgiven my slave his sin he can do whatever he likes
4176750 when i die burn me and when i turn into coal crush me and when there comes a windy day scatter my ashes in the wind
4176751 then by allah he took a firm promise from his
4176752 o my slave what made you do what you did
4176753 on the day of resurrection i will intercede and say
4176754 do not ask him about anything else first but the hadith of intercession
4176755 o abu hamza there are your brethren from basra coming to ask you about the hadith of intercession
4176756 lets pass by al hasan who is hiding himself in the house of abi khalifa and request him to tell us what anas bin malik has told us
4176757 o abu said we came to you from your brother anas bin malik and he related to us a hadith about the intercession the like of which i have never heard
4176758 man was created hasty i did not mention that but that i
4176759 the person who will be the last one to enter paradise and the last to
4176760 there will be none among you but his lord will talk to him and there will be no interpreter between him and allah he will look to his right and see nothing but his deeds which he has sent forward and will look to his left and see nothing but his deeds which he has sent forward and will look in front of him and see nothing but the hell fire facing him so save yourself from the hell fire even with half a date given in charity
4176761 what have you heard from allahs apostle regarding an najwa
4176762 everyone of you will come close to his lord who will screen him from the people and say to
4176763 adam and moses debated with each other and moses said you are
4176764 you are moses whom allah chose for his message and for his direct talk yet you blame me for a matter which had been ordained for me even before my creation thus adam overcame moses
4176765 the believers will be assembled on the day of resurrection and they will
4176766 welcome o my son o what a good son you are
4176767 these are the sources of the nile and the euphrates
4176768 this is the kauthar which your lord has kept for you
4176769 o lord i thought that none would be raised up above me
4176770 fifty prayers were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night
4176771 o muhammad what did your lord en join upon you
4176772 your followers cannot do that go back so that your lord may reduce it for you and for them
4176773 o lord please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that
4176774 o muhammad by allah i tried to persuade my nation bani israel to do less than this but they could not do it and gave it up however your followers are weaker in body heart sight and hearing so return to your lord so that he may lighten your burden
4176775 o lord my followers are weak in their bodies hearts hearing and constitution so lighten our burden
4176776 the word that comes from me does not change so it will be as i enjoined on you in the mother of the book
4176777 every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is fifty prayers in the mother of the book in reward but you are to perform only five in practice
4176778 he has lightened our burden he has given us for every good deed a tenfold reward
4176779 by allah i tried to make bani israel observe less than that but they gave it up so go back to your lord that he may lighten your burden further
4176780 o moses by allah i feel shy of returning too many times to my lord
4176781 take here you are o son of adam for nothing satisfies
4176782 what is the biggest sin in the sight of allah
4176783 to set up rivals unto allah though he alone created you
4176784 to kill your son being afraid that he may share your food with you
4176785 to commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbour
4176786 if he hears when we speak aloud then he surely hears us if we speak in stealthy quietness softly
4176787 and you have not been screening against yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should testify
4176788 how can you ask the people of the scriptures about their books while you have allahs book the quran which is the most recent of the books revealed by allah and you read it in its pure undistorted form
4176789 o the group of muslims how can you ask the
4176790 i move them my lips as allahs apostle used to move his lips
4176791 i move my lips as i saw ibn abbas moving his lips
4176792 you should listen to it and keep quiet and then it is upon us to make you recite it
4176793 so allahs apostle used to listen whenever gabriel came to him and when gabriel left the prophet would recite the quran as gabriel had recited it to him
4176794 neither say your prayer aloud i e your recitation of quran lest the pagans should hear it and abuse the quran
4176795 allahs apostle said whoever does not recite quran in a nice voice is not from us and others said extra
4176796 not to wish to be the like of except the like of two men a man
4176797 if i were given the same as this man has been given i would do the same as he is doing the other is a man whom allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way in which case one may say if i were given the same as he has been given i would do the same as he is doing
4176798 not to wish to be the like of except the like of two persons a man whom allah has given the knowledge of the quran and he recites it during the hours of the night and the hours of the day and a man whom allah has given wealth and he spends it in allahs cause during the hours of the night and during the hours of the day
4176799 o allahs apostle which sin is the biggest in allahs sight
4176800 to set up rivals unto allah though he alone created you
4176801 to kill your son lest he should share your food with you
4176802 to commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor
4176803 your stay in this world in comparison to the stay of the nations
4176804 some property was given to the prophet and he gave it to some people and withheld it from some others then he came to know that they the latter were dissatisfied so the prophet said i give to one man and leave do not give another and the one to whom i do not give is dearer to me than the one to whom i give i give to some people because of the impatience and discontent present in their hearts and leave other people because of the content and goodness allah has bestowed on them and one of them is amr bin taghlib
4176805 the sentence which allahs apostle said in my favour is dearer to me than the possession of nice red camels
4176806 my lord says if my slave comes nearer to me for a span i go nearer to
4176807 every sinful deed can be expiated and the fast is for me so i will give the reward for it and the smell which comes out of the mouth of a fasting person is better in allahs sight than the smell of musk
4176808 it does not befit a slave that he should say that he is
4176809 were i not afraid that the people would crowd around me i would surely recite in a vibrating pleasant voice as ibn mughaffal did imitating the prophet
4176810 do not believe the people of the scripture and do not disbelieve
4176811 bring here the torah and recite it if you are truthful
4176812 o muhammad they should be stoned to death but we conceal this divine law among ourselves
4176813 allah does not listen to anything as he listens to the recitation of the quran by a prophet who recites it in attractive audible sweet sounding voice
4176814 i see that you like sheep and the desert so when you are looking after your sheep or when you are in the desert and want to pronounce the adhan raise your voice for no jinn human being or any other things hear the voice but will be a witness for him on the day of resurrection
4176815 who has taught you this sura which i have heard you reciting
4176816 you are telling a lie for he taught it to me in a way different from the way you have recited it
4176817 i have heard this man reciting surat al furqan in a way that you have not taught me
4176818 the quran has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways so recite of it whichever is easy for you
4176819 o allahs apostle why should a doer people try to do good deeds the prophet
4176820 everybody will find easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created
4176821 there is none of you but has his place assigned either in hell or in paradise
4176822 shall we not depend upon that and give up doing any deeds
4176823 carry on doing good deeds for everybody will find it easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been created
4176824 before allah created the creations he wrote a book wherein he has written my mercy has preceded my anger
4176825 i have seen chicken eating some dirty things and i have taken an oath not to eat chicken
4176826 come along let me tell you something in this regard
4176827 the pagans of the tribe of mudar intervene between you and us therefore we cannot come to you except in the holy months so please order us to do something good religious deeds by which we may enter paradise by acting on them and we may inform our people whom we have left behind to observe it
4176828 i order you to do four things and forbid you from four things i order you to believe in allah do you know what is meant by belief in allah it is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except allah to offer prayers perfectly to give zakat and to give al khumus one fifth of the war booty in allahs cause and i forbid you four things i e do not drink alcoholic drinks ad dubba an naqir pitched water skins az zuruf al muzaffat and al hantam names of utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks
4176829 the painter of these pictures will be punished on the day of
4176830 the painters of these pictures will be punished on the day of resurrection and it will be said to them make alive what you have created
4176831 allah said who are most unjust than those who try to
4176832 that word which happens to be true is what a jinn snatches away by stealth from the heaven and pours it in the ears of his friend the foreteller with a sound like the cackling of a hen the soothsayers then mix with that word one hundred lies
4176833 there will emerge from the east some people who will recite
4176834 i do not see any failure here you must have the wrong measuring stick out you need to put that one away

4176838 spin like this reveals that they are more interested in grabbing headlines in the short term than solving the problem in the long term

4176841 i am friends with carlos and we will talk this week before the game
4176842 hes a very good player and our defenders will have to pay him a lot of attention because he can score a goal at any moment

4176844 we go to man united with confidence because of our performance in the last two friendly games
4176845 we played well against two top teams we scored four goals and created a lot of chances

4176898 somehow they introduced the idea that jesus wants people to have as high a birth rate as possible the rationale being the more people the more souls and thus the more souls that will make it to heaven apparently he evaluates his performance with just this one measure the increased number of souls heading to hell is not as big a concern to him
4176899 it was frustrating because there was a plethora of stuff out there and how did i know what would give us the growth needed to pay a big chunk of the education costs for three kids

4177138 there should be a decision tonight on the summer long competition among fourth year junior inoke funaki and junior college transfers greg alexander and brent rausch nothing the coaches insist should be read into alexander taking snaps with the first team offense during yesterdays afternoon practice or rausch observing from the side funaki had been the leadoff quarterback in the first nine practices
4177139 inoke was still in the weight room when greg was out here warming up so i had greg go first
4177140 its no big deal im giving it a rest i threw a lot of balls
4177141 if hes going to help us hes going to have to help us now
4177142 maybe that first round of reps rausch had to go with the new receivers that might have had something to do with it hes coming on
4177143 rolovich said rausch has forced a three way competition rolovich has rated every pass of every practice through tuesday only a few points separated the leader and no 3 quarterback
4177144 its very close thats why we dont want to rush
4177145 the prettiest ball i know colts passes were pretty but the sidearm motion was always the thing rausch can put it on you with the tight spiral and hes 6 4 so the thing is coming he almost has some anger to him on the field when people doubt him hes angry hes really playing well lately
4177146 inoke has some personal qualities that make him very attractive as a leader to his teammates he has very good decision making abilities he understands the offense his arm is not as strong as the other two but hes been working on it a lot
4177147 greg stands tall hes calm he understands the position throwing the ball the wind hes fairly accurate especially on the short stuff we havent thrown enough down the field balls to see whos going to be the most accurate on deep passes greg has some intangibles he doesnt get rattled hes here to compete and play
4177148 i want the job ive got to compete and i have to earn it thats what im trying to do well see what happens all i can do is control what i do out here the coaches will make the decision
4177149 a decision was expected yesterday but the final installment of the offense was added during yesterdays three hour morning practice the coaches decided to wait until at least after todays practice giving the top tier quarterbacks an extra day to adjust to the offense
4177150 we put in the last major piece hopefully theyll see it better today
4177151 theres no real hurry because we dont start getting into game planning until next week were just not going to rush into it we have 350 throws taped on each guy in team drills or 7 on 7 so thats over 1 000 passes that weve analyzed and theyve probably thrown 1 000 more in ball drills all three of them are good quarterbacks and we just are adding up all the intangibles and pick the guy who gives us the best chance to win
4177152 weve switched up the reps so they all go against the no 1 dbs they all go with the no 1 receivers i just told them i told you guys to make it a tough decision and you guys have but pretty soon weve got to make that tough decision thats where were going support your teammate and you push that quarterback in front of you
4177153 it is what it is youd rather have everyone healthy when guys go down you have to be a little more creative
4177154 the shuffle was triggered because of injuries to estes sore right shoulder right guard clarence tuioti mariner sore leg and reserve guard raphael ieru sore knee to ease the strain on estes he was moved to left guard by the afternoon practice he was back at center
4177155 i thought he did great no balls on the ground which is way ahead of some of the other guys
4177156 its been a while but it felt good today we always have to adjust i figured it would be good for the team just to help out and practice at center and guard
4177157 it could be good for us its making some other guys a lot more versatile
4177158 even after spring i thought ray might be better at guard
4177159 the recent plan called for hisatake to back up ahsoon who moved from left tackle to left guard but with injuries to tuioti mariner and ieru hisatake switched to right guard he has been no 1 at that position this week
4177160 the light did go on i hope it burns even brighter
4177161 its important that each guy finds a role we talked about that the guys on service teams might have a chance to start on special teams its all about finding a role
4177162 mcmackin said the service players will earn meaningful work for instance steele jantz will receive almost all of the snaps against the warriors starting defense if he remained with the regulars he would not have any snaps in passing drills
4177163 you get more reps on service teams and were still watching them if you jump off the screen you can move up the depth chart its another way of getting reps
4177164 junior college transfers dustin blount and jovonte taylor have been withheld from practicing while uh awaits certification of their associate degrees both slotbacks already have been accepted into uh they completed summer school sessions at their junior colleges last week there is no concern about their uh eligibility but the missed time has them behind in the competition
4177165 i can feel the difference in practice when i come in i feel the defense keying on me like they know i might be getting the ball
4177166 libres status as a leading returnee in the backfield is a long way from where he was last year as a receiver buried on the depth chart after making stops at menlo college and kapiolani community college following his graduation from konawaena he spent the first half of the season on the scout team but gradually started to see more time in practice with the first offense with kealoha pilares out with an injury libre made his division i debut against fresno state picking up 61 yards on six carries he had his best game of the season against washington in the regular season finale when he picked up 143 total yards
4177167 when i came into fresno it was a big change changed my life really but i dont want it to go to my head i have to keep myself grounded because theres always somebody better
4177168 i know were all going to play because we all complement each other
4177169 ive never really faced anything like this before i thought coming in against fresno was tough its going to be a lot tougher at florida but ive been training this entire time since the sugar bowl against georgia i havent taken a day off yet
4177170 redshirt freshman vaughn meatoga who entered fall camp looking to push for playing time has seen more time with the first two units rotating repetitions with seniors keala watson and joshua leonard in recent practices sophomore keahi watson kealas younger brother and geordon hanohano a true freshman from saint louis also played with the second team yesterday
4177171 it helps me because i know i have to play at keala and joshs level everyone needs to keep in stride with everything and it makes everyone work harder
4177172 meatoga won the respect of his teammates in fall camp last year and redshirted the season keahi watson also redshirted last season and hanohano joined the warriors this fall after earning all state honors at saint louis last season
4177173 theyre intelligent and studious guys theyre asking questions and theyre excited to have a shot yesterday was a good showing geordons really making progress hes going to be a great player for us in the future and haku brings a lot to the table
4177174 that can kind of accelerate your healing process when you have that competition because every practice counts you have to come out and make the most of it so i was kind of anxious to get back out got tired of sitting on the side
4177175 okay thats a strong statement certainly without kg we could imagine the t wolves selecting higher in the draft each year plus the team would have more money for free agents consequently we could imagine that more talented players would have landed in minnesota
4177176 love compared to mayo posted much better college numbers and is expected to be a much more productive nba player
4177177 i know this is all wrong but i have no actual evidence to quote to refute you
4177178 mayo by the way will probably spend his career as the leading scorer on a losing team and folks like you who think
4177179 big 3 and it unfortunately proves that hes full of cow poop to wit according to the very numbers that your columnist bases his article on the warriors raptors and 76ers combined for 129 wins were better than the pistons cavs and mavericks combined for 155 wins

4177198 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
4177199 in the lab small slabs were exposed to halogen lamps simulating sunlight larger slabs were set up outdoors and exposed to more realistic environmental conditions including direct sunlight and wind the tests showed that asphalt absorbs a considerable amount of heat and that the highest temperatures are found a few centimeters below the surface this is where a heat exchanger would be located to extract the maximum amount of energy experimenting with various asphalt compositions they found that the addition of highly conductive aggregates like quartzite can significantly increase heat absorption as can the application of a special paint that reduces reflection

4177220 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4177221 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4177222 i think only a great man would have made that choice

4177236 with this whole scenario of tuberculosis and disease in general i think its really important for our producers to be careful in handling their cattle so they dont end up in a predicament of being quarantined because its not a pretty picture when that happens
4177237 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule on sept 16 1924
4177238 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
4177239 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
4177240 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
4177241 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
4177242 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
4177243 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
4177244 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship

4177281 the main reason for a prospective student to choose northeastern is because the school has a co op program that provides students the opportunity to work for a company for six months and gain a full experience outside of the classroom it prepares us for what it is like to get a job by helping students write their r sum s prepare for interviews and get positions with prominent companies
4177282 northeastern employs a model of higher education and engages students in an experiential part of their education through cooperative education internships service learning student research and study abroad programs we work very hard at integrating the experiences of students outside the classroom with their experiences inside the classroom northeastern provides a high end education coupled with very professional experiences
4177283 the best reason to choose northern arizona university is that students really have the ability to get to know their professors our professors could be getting paid to do research at a larger university but they have a strong interest in assisting their students not only will the teachers help you succeed in class but they will help you achieve lifetime goals

4177286 north central is a great small college in the middle of somewhere north central college has an academic program that links a liberal arts education with applied fields and a wide array of opportunities in the area the college is located in one of the top rated cities in america and is only a 30 minute train ride from downtown chicago the combination of opportunities in the class room and in the area is very unique to north central college
4177287 north dakota state university is an excellent university for any major mainly because of the location the fargo morehead area has about 200 000 people and it is growing so there are a lot of opportunities for students freshman can get internships and graduates have a place to live but it is also a small enough community where students are not just a number teachers will help you and you recognize people on campus its a great place to make a name for yourself

4177289 b ack in the day john mccain was the sort of politician who would stand first in line to call out this sort of swill
4177290 inability to call plainly a lie a lie or a liar a liar
4177291 several of the ministers who worked with obama in the 1980s who say he is unfit for office
4177292 conservative publishing aspires even to the standards of the nonideological or what conservatives call the liberal publishing establishment
4177293 inexcusable that the mainstream media itself has done such a putrid job of exploring obamas roots
4177294 many voters have already shown a willingness to believe the worst about the unfamiliar obama a book that purports to prove each of these easily disprovable claims is something of an inconvenience for the illinois senator
4177295 book has already had more holes shot through it than one of dick cheneys hunting partners
4177296 has also written or co written books saying u s officials plan to merge the country with canada and mexico and that oil is neither a fossil fuel nor a finite resource
4177297 the second c 17 carrying humanitarian assistance commodities to georgia arrived in tbilisi today
4177298 we expect that they would not interfere with the humanitarian deliveries
4177299 we are looking at a number of options in that regard
4177300 and in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4177301 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4177302 we would hope that he would be true to his word
4177303 the provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place and that means that military activities have to cease
4177304 the russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively in a way that went far beyond reasserting the autonomy of abkhazia and south ossetia
4177305 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not
4177306 we are just watching the situation there are still snipers out there certain groups have gotten through and the provocations are continuing
4177307 we will settle things with everyone and right now establishing peace is the main issue
4177308 we are not there to defend the ports we are there to provide humanitarian aid
4177309 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4177310 when we went in the waves did not look too bad
4177311 we were shouting and waving for help but we could not see anyone doing anything it was horrible
4177312 holding on to a body board for a while is what gave us strength
4177313 they said that anyone who gets on that rock drowns if we missed that rock we would have gone out to sea
4177314 this spot is for me this is for mikey and this is for dada
4177315 that spot is for you and then theres an extra spot whos going to sit there
4177316 yes we need to have a baby to fill in that spot
4177317 the baby would be a baby and not a princess
4177318 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4177319 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away

4177321 commodity stocks have been dragging the indices up for months now and if it wasnt for gains in mining and oil stocks today we would be looking at another down day
4177322 while todays rally is very good news for the markets the inflationary impact of commodity prices rises is very concerning at this stage

4177338 it is okay to use artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose while you are pregnant
4177339 however people with a rare condition called phenylketonuria pku should limit their intake of aspartame
4177340 results from subsequent carcinogenic studies studies that examine whether a substance can cause cancer on these sweeteners and other approved sweeteners have not provided clear evidence of an association between artificial sweeteners and cancer in people
4177341 before approving these sweeteners the fda reviewed more than 100 safety studies that were conducted on each sweetener included studies to assess cancer risk

4177371 i cant believe he did it this is amazing im so happy i can only jump up and down
4177372 the first thing i thought of was my parents and my coach
4177373 we are proud descendants of the great ghengis khan and tuvshee proved the strength of mongolians in the olympics
4177374 it is so exciting that our mongolian flag was raised in beijing and tuvshee won in the judo competition
4177375 me and several of my friends have bought mongolian vodka to celebrate this wonderful news it is going to be a very exciting night
4177376 right after the june 29 election we were in central square protesting election results and throwing stones against policemen and interior troops
4177377 i knew how to set the hit and i did it
4177378 and if we can really let people see that and draw in the fans maybe we can change the state of the sport
4177379 thats asking a lot revelation after revelation about drugs have led to questions about whether the next unprecedented run or jump or throw might be too good to be true
4177380 people want to know that theyre watching the real thing
4177381 we have to prevent from choking the life out of the sport
4177382 theres the 110 meter hurdles which also showcases the current holder of the world record cubas dayron robles and the man whose mark he eclipsed chinas liu xiang
4177383 but i feel that day by day there is no pressure on me
4177384 if hes healthy and good enough for gold it could become as big a story as home country darling cathy freemans 400 meter victory at the 2000 sydney olympics
4177385 i just dont want to hear about drugs i dont want to hear about the cheaters
4177386 i just want to hear about the exciting matchups that were getting ready to see with liu xiang and robles defar isinbayeva theres too many exciting athletes competing for us to talk about its time to show the greatness of our sport

4177391 el saldo neto real de las medidas asciende a 31 4 millones cuatro millones menos de los anunciados hace ahora 21 d as para innovaci n
4177392 ha tenido que dar la cara ante la nueva huida del presidente de la generalitat francisco camps que tan mal est n las cosas que ha renunciado a participar a los valencianos el plan no sea que en la foto se le asocie con el fracaso
4177393 donde est n en este plan los 600 millones anunciados para inyectar liquidez a la econom a los 300 para comprar hipotecas empaquetadas a las cajas los 200 para el circulantes de las pymes y los 100 de respaldo a las empresas que licitan obra p blica
4177394 redacci n de proyectos de infraestructuras por valor de 1 000 millones
4177395 el resto de lo anunciado 132 3 millones se reparte entre el plan de competitividad que se ha visto recortado de los 30 millones anunciados hace un mes a 26 millones innovaci n recibe 3 millones vendidos ocho veces en los dos ltimos meses y formaci n personal peque o comercio recibe otros 1 2 millones
4177396 en la ltima semana la consellera del ramo ha pedido la devoluci n de ayudas por importe de tres millones
4177397 si se destina 2 1 millones el saldo neto es de menos 0 9 millones
4177398 simplemente se han reubicado de proyectos de ejercicios anteriores a la crisis y no finalizados y ahora se les asigna a la crisis
4177399 improvisar cifras fiando a la irreflexi n de quienes las oyen y a que no las cotejaran ni con las promesas hechas ni con los presupuestos en ejecuci n
4177400 en estos 1 400 millones que unos d as eran 1 600 y otros 1 200 no hay ni un euro para inyectar liquidez
4177401 no solo no tiene medidas sino que tiene tantas que las cambia cada semana seg n viene la temporada
4177402 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now
4177403 llevar agua desde la espa a seca que es castilla la mancha hasta una parte del territorio que tiene un mar infinito para desalar es una soluci n que no es concebible actualmente
4177404 creo que es un asunto zanjado pero en todo caso me parece una opci n incre ble
4177405 creo que no es oportuno ni desde el punto de vista social ni pol tico ni medioambiental trasferir agua tal y como se conoce y llevarlo de una cuenca a otra en estos tiempos hay otros recursos m s razonables y que en este momento se est invirtiendo mucho en ellos como son las plantas desaladoras
4177406 con otros colectivos y organizaciones de nuestra regi n el considerar que el ministerio y por ende el gobierno del se or zapatero sigue barajando pol ticas insostenibles en materia de agua muy alejadas de lo que venimos defendiendo como nueva cultura del agua que pase por valorar el agua como recurso social y ecol gico y que implica un profundo cambio tico con relaci n a las generaciones futuras y al entorno natural
4177407 lamentablemente somos testigos de c mo el tema del agua genera grandes pol micas y abundantes dosis de demagogia tanto por el pp como el psoe y los respectivos gobiernos auton micos implicados como es el caso del de castilla la mancha cuando realmente la pol tica h drica e hidr ulica en nuestro pa s ha cambiado muy poco a pesar de los cambios de color en el gobierno central
4177408 no cuenta con ninguna racionalidad hidr ulica econ mica y ecol gica pero sin embargo si tienen garant a jur dica mientras no se cambien sus normas de explotaci n que es lo que permite al gobierno central aprobar trasvases continuamente
4177409 seguimos esperando que el gobierno de jos mar a barreda muestra alguna vez los recursos que anuncia a los citados trasvases pues s lo se trata de propaganda ya que l y sus consejeros son conscientes de que nunca van a ganarlos
4177410 que suponen en definitiva el trasvase de rentas de una regi n a otra
4177411 se van a cobrar aunque todav a no se sabe qui n lo va a pagar
4177412 nos han dicho que estemos tranquilos que se van a mover para que lo cobremos
4177413 van a seguir estudiando diferentes medidas para que en el futuro los pescadores puedan seguir desarrollando su trabajo en las mejores condiciones
4177414 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now
4177415 chicago is an amazing show and ive wanted a part in it for a long time
4177416 we have to book holidays if we want to see each other perform
4177417 our partners love coming to and criticising our performances they think theyre simon cowell
4177418 i want to distribute them to all the rabbis shuls and youth clubs before rosh hashanah
4177419 if everybody could understand the horrors of substance abuse we might be able to save a life if we can save one life thats why we are here
4177420 what has been quite shocking even for the researchers is the frankness with which some respondents said that there are teenage girls and boys using drugs like marijuana cocaine and speed this is alarming as it was always thought that the girls in particular of stamford hill were totally immune from such terrible things
4177421 the growing social acceptability of these substances and the ease of obtaining them would suggest that this has the danger of mushrooming into a far greater problem
4177422 hay una corriente de pensamiento que una de las mejores forma de lidiar con la gripe aviar es a trav s de la detecci n y la contenci n
4177423 la capacidad de detectar y tipificar el virus de la gripe aviar es esencial para aplicar controles lo antes posible y as minimizar los riesgo de contagio de cualquier virus potencialmente pand mico
4177424 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now
4177425 this was the biggest single bar ever weve constructed in over 3 000 events
4177426 it was an adrenalin rush being at such an exciting event serving so many people and all the while raising the bar
4177427 once again they rose to the challenge proving that theyre prepared for the big ones
4177428 also the lack of ethnic and religious understanding taught in the school system provides fertile ground for intolerance
4177429 whited sepulchre a person who is inwardly evil but outwardly professes to be virtuous
4177430 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness
4177431 with a home in hampstead london and a chalet in the alps he was wealthy and had an enviable social life his dinner parties were eagerly anticipated thanks to his skills in the kitchen and ready wit
4177432 hundreds of people with financial troubles would flock to dunners home in golders green they queued patiently to see him and tell him their problems and depending on his analysis of their needs he would write them a cheque
4177433 an invitation to the dunners table for shabbos or yom tov was prized like a winning raffle ticket
4177434 the table was set with crystal with silver it had all the gravitas of a royal banquet though none of the pretensions yet
4177435 the many guests at his table almost always included the forlorn and lonely among the most regular indeed ubiquitous guests at his table were those whom someone described as shivrei keilim broken vessels
4177436 who became as if a member of the dunner household over a period of years her lineage was to put it charitably undistinguished
4177437 nothing can be sole or whole that has not been rent
4177438 there are a lot of things that yad vashem doesnt know
4177439 they dont know the names of more than three million of the jews who perished in the holocaust but i can promise you that if they check the records in the city of hamburg they will discover that there was a hans hitler who died about 25 years ago
4177440 what my step grandfather lacked in vitriol was more than made up by the fierceness of my grandmother who was a sworn nazi she believed in the nazi ideology before during and even after the war she was proud that her father in law was hitlers brother although he kept away from politics
4177441 instead he managed a caf in berlin and because everyone knew that he was the fuhrers brother all the nazi elite patronized his establishment this made his family and him including my grandparents local nobility
4177442 you cannot say i am related to hitler because my grandmother happened to divorce my grandfather and subsequently marry a half nephew of adolf hitler its nonsense to say i am related
4177443 it opened my eyes to some appalling deprivation on our doorstep
4177444 poverty violence drugs alcohol and unemployment fuel a desperate downward spiral which was the backdrop for my encounter with the disabled and those who have fallen through the so called safety net of society
4177445 i was embarrassed to have to admit to and confront my own personal fears of those with mental or physical impediments but cherished the time i was able to spend with so many people who showed me that beneath the disabilities are some of the kindest and most loving people around
4177446 i have never had so much fun and pure joy giving away money in my life
4177447 tennessee and tennessee 9th district voted firmly for the post racial politics that has carried a new generation to power
4177448 it is the job of israeli ambassadors to speak on behalf of israel to the european union we need to support israel but we speak on behalf of european jewry
4177449 the age of peoplehood is over if peoplehood means that we feel a connection to all jews we are all stuck because young people feel responsibility to all people and some might feel that the idea of peoplehood might be racist pushing peoplehood is the wrong value because it is not going to draw us in
4177450 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4177451 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4177452 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4177453 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4177454 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4177455 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4177456 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4177457 i was getting all this attention due to my graduation project which was a series of short films that were pretty popular at the time on the web
4177458 when wieden kennedy found out i was signed as a director they were very excited and wanted me to direct the commercial
4177459 the script came from w k but i am proud to say the character designs are my own along with of course the direction of the piece we filmed the commercial in argentina kenya and china the trip around the world was a amazing especially for me being new to big campaigns
4177460 aside from working on more commercials i am getting into directing music videos and would love to create my own animated shorts and series
4177461 they did add to the tower height that was a good thing
4177462 this the revised windmill law would still require the two variances i got to begin with
4177463 it means that instead of the town encouraging wind power in the region it may be the zoning board of appeals that now arbitrates it on a case by case basis
4177464 ill quote the document this is a fluid document subject to change its not cheap to do one of these projects
4177465 if we see a problem we can always come back and address it
4177466 for a minute i actually thought about moving to gorham
4177467 involved in the massacre of 128 civilians by a soviet partisan unit in the village of naliboki in may 1943
4177468 the historical facts show that the bielski group was not even in naliboki at the time they only reached the area in august 1943 in may when the polish civilians were killed my fathers group was 50 kilometres away so would not have been able to get there
4177469 there is now a film about what he did it shows the world who he was he saved 1 200 jews and there are now 10 000 descendants of those jews around the world he was a modern day moses and i am very proud of him the film is a wonderful portrayal of what he and the other partisans did
4177470 since i am a bielski survivor i can categorically state that it is a fabricated lie
4177471 it is very upsetting and a terrible accusation there were jews in every russian detachment im not saying jews did not participate in killings but the bielski group was not in naliboki and not involved with those killings they are just trying to tarnish his memory
4177472 when we escaped from the camps and joined the partisans we were most scared of the locals more even than of the germans now they have the cheek to say we were the murderers
4177473 we recommend that in the first instance it remains the ideal that the rabbi should be the one to give the eulogy
4177474 however in circumstances where the rabbi deems it appropriate or necessary for a lay person to deliver the eulogy then he may use his own discretion to allow for that to happen
4177475 ensure suitability in terms of content as well as length
4177476 there is no longer any need to be concerned or to look over ones shoulder
4177477 rabbis are frequently called on to speak about people they have never ever met
4177478 it has to be better to have someone speak from the heart about someone they loved rather than giving notes to the rabbi to speak
4177479 in my seven years experience in bournemouth i never heard anyone say anything inappropriate i heard beautiful speeches at the cemetery
4177480 i limited it to family members or if it was an occasion where someone had been very heavily involved in a jewish organisation the chairman could say a few words it was not a blanket permission to anybody to speak
4177481 an ongoing concern for more than two decades it is time to take a definitive stance on a number of such issues
4177482 the next issue on our agenda will be kashrut and catering within our shuls
4177483 some call genealogy merely a pastime but i think of it as a legacy which this generation can provide for posterity and the best thing about it is that you dont necessarily have to pore over dusty archives
4177484 these days there is so much information available online as well as in the documents and photographs you have in your own home
4177485 the media are largely controlled by jews as is hollywood and they account for more than half the top policy making jobs in the clinton administration
4177486 we come from an old jewish family its not our habit to marry red indians
4177487 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4177488 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4177489 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4177490 i like this test for a lot of reasons one of the most obvious reasons is that it ensures that test time isnt sacrificed at the end of the cycle to make up for poor planning elsewhere a certain recipe for disaster
4177491 oh my gosh people are going to want a small lightweight solid state computer
4177492 and so this idea of launching it in a virtual way where we had a lot of people reporting on it and writing about it who werent at the d conference who couldnt see it and had no way of asking questions about it led to a lot of misinformation and negative press
4177493 the economic downturn in countries like the uk is one of many reasons
4177494 and with it it doesnt really matter where you are the language barrier is much less
4177495 this is a further blow for jobs in the uk financial services sector which is being brought about by the credit crunch and the changing
4177496 what i love about this city is that it has all the conveniences of the 21st century but has so much history also you can see living history here as many of the bedouin live pretty much as they did at the time of abraham
4177497 we took it through conceptualisation planning and building it took a chunk out of our lives but it was great
4177498 i drive past quite often its wonderful to see what i and a lot of other people sweated for
4177499 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4177500 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4177501 windows 2000 could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt windows system32 config systemd startup options for
4177502 at a start price of 99 cents and of course with no reserve
4177503 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4177504 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4177505 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4177506 is it full valuation no the stock will be worth more five years from now than it is today its a nice growth company
4177507 there is a still lot to be done here in new brunswick and its all about money and time science and education
4177508 its a never ending process because we are into environmental and climate change
4177509 we keep looking ahead to see what are significant areas that we might want to help protect that wouldnt get protected otherwise
4177510 a lot of those are on the tidal shores because there is a lot of change and erosion that goes on there others are on rivers and lakes
4177511 this is a site of international importance in the migration of hundreds of thousands of shore birds
4177512 this is just one of examples of the kind of work the nature conservancy of canada does
4177513 this is the birds last refuelling stop before flying 4 300 kilometres non stop over the ocean to south america
4177514 the protection of precious habitat across the entire province is our natural legacy to the future generations
4177515 we know when we come out here were in a game
4177516 you cant let up on them they always come back
4177517 this is the type of game of we play every time
4177518 were just one hit away one swing away from winning the game
4177519 its better to lose a game like this early in the tournament than later on when you cant do anything about it
4177520 on the first one i was looking for my pitch and i got it
4177521 the one i hit to right field i was just trying to get the runner over
4177522 weve got a lot of power on this team were a good hitting team
4177523 thank you jk harris for giving me my life back
4177524 thanks for the good service and care im so happy i picked jk harris the name is what sold me i like the name

4177527 i last saw leon at the glamour awards i was collecting an award so it was cool to have him there with me
4177528 leon is in the studio recording songs for his debut album his voice has developed so much his fans will be blown away andy has also had him pumping iron in the gym so the girls are in for a real treat
4177529 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
4177530 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
4177531 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
4177532 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
4177533 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
4177534 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
4177535 weve seen taxes go up over the last several years the advantages of those customers having an escrow account is that we can make those shortages into smaller monthly payments
4177536 of all the bands playing the fillmore a lot we were one of the last ones to get signed
4177537 we werent like the dead or janis or country joe we were more of an r amp b soul act we didnt really fit in that san francisco band thing though we did play a human be in at golden gate park we were probably closest to the dead as friends they were the anointed ones we were scruffy east bay guys
4177538 listening to those old tunes i came to the realization that when youre that young youre just punk
4177539 punk rock wasnt invented yet but it sounds like that to me ive been trying in a way to garner some of that strength again and its working fine but thats not my aesthetic
4177540 paul really hipped me how to get into certain funk grooves
4177541 it was a study for me the thing about the loading zone that i loved was that every time we played something we played it differently thats kind of my jazz influence composing on the spot when you can
4177542 our first big gig was the first trips festival at longshoremans hall
4177543 i dont know how we got it there were at least 1 000 outside trying to get in it was the first concert where the cops were suddenly aware of how many hippies there were
4177544 she said im kind of big like a big mama thornton and i play harmonica
4177545 she walked through the door in a post office uniform with little white cat eyes glasses and i said thats our girl she just looked right we evolved as a dance band with a fusion of r amp b and rock and we ended up as a psychedelic soul band once we added linda she was singing for us by the time we opened for cream at winterland her mother made her a floor length ruffled red leather cape it was very dramatic
4177546 we started really quiet and built to this screaming wall of rage and then all stopped on a dime
4177547 linda was singing with us and we played our hearts out
4177548 afterwards sam moore came up and said you guys are pretty good if you keep doing what youre doing youre going to be
4177549 we need to drill to get oil we need more oil to have lower prices if we drill we get lower prices
4177550 i was amazed at ehsans commitment his ideas and his dedication
4177551 so i contacted the author of the article he then introduced me to ehsan the afghan school project was born and today it is a grassroots initiative that initially helped to establish and continues to help operate the accc
4177552 when we turn to the bureaucrats who operate these systems they throw up their hands and say were doing the best we can with what weve got
4177553 and what weve got is far short of what we were promised
4177554 right now in the us in particular we have a really strong concentration of the industry
4177555 so a lot of people are really concerned about this do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
4177556 i dont think we do i think we want to have a broader marketplace than that
4177557 all of the existing search engines are proprietary black boxes
4177558 you have no idea how things are ranked and whats going on
4177559 been very very intelligent about understanding the new media and actually involving people in new ways
4177560 i actually think this is something that is going to be really really important for a lot of politicians
4177561 i dont know exactly whats going to happen but i am generally optimistic because i see that ordinary people actually do love to engage with the issues and actually talk about things in detail
4177562 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended
4177563 the tidal surge in energy and other commodity costs is showing unmistakable signs of turning up in consumer prices at large
4177564 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live
4177565 compromise has been a big part of this and thats what it takes in this body to make something happen
4177566 our bill also opens up coal to liquids we couldnt have gotten 44 republicans for that
4177567 we need to take advantage of the resources we have now
4177568 a lot of the opposition to the bill is really a case of trying to keep drilling as an election issue instead of getting more drilling
4177569 its a shame but when we get called to international duty weve got to go
4177570 ill keep checking on the guys and hopefully well move on top of the table and do enough to win the title
4177571 we have enough guys there with experience and some good young fellows hopefully they can go out and get a job done and get on top of the table
4177572 effectively extinguishing creativity knowledge and open source development the foundation of which is community participation
4177573 the family they have questions and they want answers and no one is doing nothing about that
4177574 when it was motionless it was actually towed to the bay
4177575 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre
4177576 its not in the same context as the hole in the aeroplane or the grounding of the aircraft
4177577 the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4177578 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion

4177617 cuando la gente vea el filme dir tengo que ir a barcelona
4177618 espero que la gente en espa a no vaya a ver la pel cula pensando que es un documental de barcelona la historia podr a haber sucedido en otros lugares de europa a todos nos gusta barcelona y es bonita la manera en la que se retrat la ciudad

4177624 we are very encouraged by the results as they are well distributed across all four of our regions
4177625 obviously certain markets have seen a slowdown however we are less reliant on local work because of the way our international offices are integrated
4177626 those actions include an effort called the global 200 to focus on expanding the firms relationship with its 200 most important client relationships trimming the firms more than 30 practices to 11 core practices and growing in key markets such as new york where the firms office has doubled in the last three years

4177892 drivers often swerve out of the way of the numerous potholes in and around boston only to end up smashing into a fellow driver or object that surrounds the roadside
4177893 my car is not a piece of shit it just needs a good duck tape
4177894 90 of car accidents in boston are a result of drivers avoiding potholes

4177899 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein prod uced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
4177900 identification of potentially pathogenic anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
4177901 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
4177902 the phones great to use im just not happy with the setup
4177903 i think they rolled out the phones prematurely and once the phones sold they tried to sort out the connectivity but are finding problems and they are still charging inflated rates
4177904 and dont get me started on the battery life of the phone im only getting three days battery life instead of the up to 300 hours as in the specifications
4177905 at best the 3g coverage is poor out of the city area so why would you expect apple iphone to work well
4177906 this can be due to a number of factors including your height above street level the nature of your building hills between you and the cell site and atmospheric conditions
4177907 having cancer has its low points but what its taught me going through the treatment is its all about hope
4177908 people go through a lot when theyre diagnosed with cancer
4177909 but i was absolutely determined that the goal was to eradicate the cancer if this treatment was going to do it so be it
4177910 to be aware of the issue and pay particular attention to these faults
4177911 if it does get to a state of flaming or scalding if in any doubt call the fire service we do not know if there is a manufacturing fault a user fault or a dud batch but we want to give the public assurance we are trying to be responsible
4177912 amy price was another one of our teachers she choreographed our classical piece and our contemporary piece for the show at the end of the intensive she was fun to have class with but she still expected alot out of us this is a picture of ms amy correcting me in pointe class
4177913 seven day cycles are common in winter time it takes that long for one weather system to clear as another comes in but unfortunately this one has set in so that it arrives every saturday
4177914 it was so cold i couldnt feel my hands its been raining so much and i would have liked to play more games its no fun
4177915 i was able to provide them with additional evidence relating to the scampi inquiry and mr peters involvement in that
4177916 that new evidence i believe takes the complaint and the issue to another level
4177917 i have all this accumulated knowledge and experience and no one wants to employ it and im not sure why
4177918 that im of no further use to my country is why im considering australia that my former parliamentary colleagues seem not to want to appoint me to anything but are quite happy to accommodate others who have left or are about to so as to shut them up from whingeing from the sidelines in election year
4177919 politics was never my ambition i was coaxed into it by others
4177920 i always wanted to achieve in the entertainment industry that i succeeded in politics was as much a surprise to me as anyone
4177921 im too tarnished as a former transsexual politician to be taken any more seriously in entertainment than dancing with the stars
4177922 it seems that i am not valued for my experience in either local or central government so i guess i wasted 14 years of my life in publicly elected service and ended up unemployable
4177923 due to atrocious weather a helicopter which was dispatched from christchurch has been unable to reach the location
4177924 there was some argument before me as to whether it was fair and reasonable for defendants to have to pay the medical expenses when all they were doing was exercising their statutory rights to have a blood sample taken
4177925 the district court is a creature of statute and it follows that the power to make the order must be derived from a statutory provision
4177926 i have heard stories that there was a tender for 2 5m all that henderson asked for was expressions of interest
4177927 he had not got to the stage of discussing price with anyone there was no offer on the table
4177928 sometimes they say this is the sort of price area we are interested in talking about and these are the conditions its a concept we have used regularly
4177929 no one puts a price every wide boy in town can be lining up for a property and they are all being cute or you have got serious players
4177930 an expression of interest is a worthless piece of paper an offer is capable of acceptance
4177931 obtain valuations and conclude sale and purchase agreements at those valuations
4177932 we thought when the council deal went through we would get paid but when we contacted them earlier this week they said there was no money to pay us
4177933 were just trying to keep them warm and fed and comfortable
4177934 i think it was a bun fight to be honest it was claim and counter claim between wells and townsend there were some colourful exchanges off the air
4177935 i do not think sue wells and peter townsend left the best of friends
4177936 they were not pinning each other up against the walls or anything there was a little more tension but it was not any nastier or louder than it was on air
4177937 sue wells is normally very calm but she was angry today
4177938 i did have to remind them a couple of times that i was about to turn their mics back on they were energetic in their discussions before the mics came back on so i had to tell them we were back on air in 10 seconds
4177939 your mum has always been there to look after you guys
4177940 things havent been easy you guys havent always been easy at school and school hasnt always been easy for you but shes battled on to make it work for you and we thought people like that dont get recognised very much so we had a bit of a whip round
4177941 if you find a trolley along the way you just bring it back
4177942 this says to our community that being a good parent matters
4177943 i got adam into it because he wasnt going to school and he liked computers so i got him into a course as well
4177944 ive flown over it and looked down on dome shelter it was a real weird feeling to see it there i just thought wow ive got to get back up there soon
4177945 i dont worry about going more chance you could lose a leg driving down the road from the mountain
4177946 the events of the past few weeks have really shocked the public people are looking for greater assurance of quality care for our seniors
4177947 its completely wrong and it shouldnt be happening to children
4177948 this is a public bus shes a member of the public she pays a fare
4177949 the third time it happened i was standing there and i got on to the bus and said you have to let this child on the bus
4177950 a lot of kids go to that school from out of zone and rely on that bus to get to school
4177951 one driver didnt even open the door he just yelled out school bus
4177952 these changes were communicated to our people and the driver concerned was counseled on the new process
4177953 our charter states quite clearly that school children can travel on both public and school buses
4177954 that link between the condition of the forest and marine life has largely been ignored in the past
4177955 we are delighted that so many projects are coming to fruition in the middle east which enable us to be present in most of the markets in this zone
4177956 the group is keen to meet the growing needs of its customers in particular in the main industrial basins these investments are carried by the trend for outsourcing industrial gas needs and are in line with group growth strategy which is to invest over one billion dollars in the middle east in the coming five years
4177957 jika engkau melakukan dosa dan bukan merupakan kebiasaan maka mohonlah ampun kepada allah dan bertaubat kepada nya kerana apabila seorang hamba mengakui dosanya kemudian dia bertaubat kepada allah nescaya allah akan mengampuni dosanya
4177958 katakanlah wahai hamba hamba ku yang melampaui batas janganlah kamu berputus asa dari rahmat allah sesungguhnya dialah yang maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
4177959 wahai orang orang yang beriman bertaubatlah kamu kepada allah dengan taubat nasuha mudah mudahan tuhan kamu akan menghapuskan kesalahan kesalahan kamu dan memasukkan kamu ke dalam syurga yang mengalir di bawahnya beberapa sungai
4177960 dan bertaubatlah kamu sekalian kepada allah wahai orang orang yang beriman supaya kamu berjaya
4177961 dan juga orang orang yang apabila melakukan perbuatan keji atau menganiaya diri sendiri mereka segera ingat kepada allah lalu memohon ampun akan dosa mereka dan sememangnya tidak ada yang mengampunkan dosa dosa melainkan allah dan mereka juga tidak meneruskan perbuatan keji yang mereka telah lakukan itu sedang mereka mengetahui akan salahnya dan akibatnya
4177962 orang orang yang demikian sifatnya balasannya ialah keampunan dari tuhan mereka dan syurga syurga yang mnengalir dibawahnya beberapa sungai mereka kekal didalamnya dan yang demikian itulah sebaik baik balasan bagi orang orang yang beramal
4177963 maka barangsiapa yang bertaubat sesudah melakukan kejahatan itu dan memperbaiki diri maka sesungguhnya allah menerima taubatnya
4177964 hai manusia bertaubatlah kepada allah dan memohonlah ampunan nya kerana aku juga bertaubat sebanyak seratus kali dalam satu hari
4177965 sesungguhnya hak hak allah terlalu agung jika harus dilaksanakan oleh manusia namun mereka harus tetap bertaubat pada waktu pagi dan petang hari
4177966 dulu diantara orang orang sebelum kamu ada seorang lelaki yang sudah membunuh 99 orang lalu dia bertanya tentang penduduk bumi yang paling banyak ibadahnya
4177967 ya tidak siapapun yang dapat menghalangi antara dirimu dengan taubatmu
4177968 orang ini telah bertaubat dan menghadap kepada allah dengan sepenuh hatinya
4177969 ukurlah jarak antara dua negeri itu mana jarak yang lebih dekat maka ia akan menjadi bahagiannya
4177970 lalu allah menurunkan wahyu kepada negeri yang satu ini agar jaraknya lebih jauh dan memberikan wahyu kepada negeri yang satunya lagi supaya jaraknya lebih dekat maka jarak ke negeri yang baik adalah lebih dekat dan negeri yang ditinggalkannya kira kira satu jengkal maka ia dijadikan sebagai penduduk negeri yang baik itu
4177971 wahai rasulullah telah berlalu suatu hukuman bagiku maka laksanakanlah hukuman itu atas diriku
4177972 perlakukanlah dengan cara yang baik terhadap wanita ini maka jika dia telah melahirkan bawalah dia kepadaku
4177973 mengapa engkau menyembahyangkan mayat wanita itu wahai rasulullah padahal dia telah berzina
4177974 sesungguhnya dia telah bertaubat dengan betul betul taubat yang andaikata taubatnya itu dibagi bagikan diantara tujuh puluh orang penduduk madinah tentu taubatnya itu sanggup untuk menutupi kesalahan mereka semua dan apakah engkau pernah mendapatkan suatu taubat yang lebih utama jika dibandingkan dengan wanita itu yang menyerahkan nyawanya kepada allah
4177975 kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat beriman dan mengerjakan amal shaleh maka kejahatan mereka itu akan diganti dengan kebaikan
4177976 allah menggantikan kejahatan yang pernah mereka lakukan dengan kebaikan pada hari kiamat dan memberikan kepada mereka kedudukan yang baik dari setiap kejahatan mereka
4177977 sahaja aku solat sunat taubat dua rakaat kerana allah taala
4177978 aku mohon keampunan kepada allah yang maha agong yang tiada tuhan yang lain melainkan dia yang hidup dan berdiri nya dan aku bertaubat kepada nya
4177979 di antara tanda tanda telah dekatnya kiamat ialah manusia bermegah megahan dalam mendirikan masjid
4177980 tidak akan datang kiamat sehingga banyak perbuatan dan perkataan keji memutuskan hubungan silaturahim dan sikap yang buruk dalam tetangga
4177981 sesungguhnya di antara tanda tanda telah dekatnya hari kiamat ialah manusia tidak mahu mengucapkan salam kepada orang lain kecuali yang dikenalnya saja
4177982 di antara tanda tanda telah dekatnya hari kiamat ialah akan muncul pakaian pakaian wanita dan apabila mereka memakainya keadaannya seperti telanjang
4177983 sesungguhnya sebelum datangnya hari kiamat akan banyak kesaksian palsu dan disembunyikan kesaksian yang benar
4177984 tiada lahir seorang anak keturunanmu melainkan telah aku datangkan kepadanya yang menjaganya dari tipu daya iblis dan dari jin jin yang jahat
4177985 aku beri pahala setiap hasanat sepuluh lipat ganda dan ada harapan ditambah sedang kejahatan satu lawan satu dan ada harapan dihapuskan
4177986 sesungguhnya saya ingin masuk islam tetapi terhalang oleh ayat yang berbunyi
4177987 illa man taba waamana wa amila amalan salihin fa ula ika yubaddilullahu sayyiantihim hasanaat
4177988 bahawa didalam ayat ini ada syarat iaitu harus beramal soleh sedang saya belum tahu apakah dapat melakukan amal soleh atau tidak
4177989 inna allah la yagh firu yusyroka bihi wayaghfiru ma dunia dzalika liman yasyau
4177990 didalam ayat ini juga ada syarat dan saya tidak mengetahui apakah allah s w t hendak mengampuni saya atau tidak
4177991 qul ya ibadiyalladzina ala antusikum laa taqnathu min rahmatillahi innallah yagh firudz dzunuba jami a innahu huwal ghafurrahiem
4177992 muhammad bin abdulrahman assulami menulis surat kepadaku ayahku menceritakan kepadaku saya duduk dekat
4177993 ada seorang pada ummat ummat yang dahulu ia selalu berbuat maksiat maka pada suatu hari ketika ia sedang berjalan teringat pada perbuatan perbuatannya yang lalu maka ia berdoa allahumma ghufranaka yang bermaksud ya allah aku harap ampunanmu sebanyak tiga kali mendadak ia mati maka allah s w t mengampuni baginya
4177994 saya mendapat keterangan bahawa nabi ibrahim a s ketika diperlihatkan oleh
4177995 ya ibrahim biarkan urusan hambaku kerana hambaku itu diantara ia bertaubat maka aku memaafkan atau akan melahirkan turunan yang ibadat kepada ku atau ia memang celaka maka untuknya telah tersedia jahannam untuk tempatnya dihari kemudian
4177996 berita ini sebagai dalil bahawa seorang hamba bila bertaubat maka
4177997 wa man yamal suan yadh lim nafsa hu tsumma yas tagh firillah yajidillaha ghafura rahiema yang bermaksud dan siapa berbuat kejahatan atau aniaya pada diri sendiri kemudian membaca istighfar minta ampun pasti akan mendapatkan allah maha pengampun lagi penyayang
4177998 disebelah barat ada pintu gerbang besar yang dibuat oleh allah untuk pintu taubat lebarnya sekira perjalanan 40 70 tahun tetap terbuka dan tidak ditutup sehingga matahari terbit dibarat
4177999 sesungguhnya allah bagi orang yang selalu kembali kepadanya maha pengampun
4178000 sifat orang aarif yang menegnal allah s w t ada enam iaitu
4178001 pada suatu hari umar masuk kepada nabi muhammad s a w sambil menangis maka ditanya
4178002 ya rasulullah dimuka pintu ini ada seoarng pemuda telah membakar hatiku sambil menangis
4178003 maka allah s w t akan mengampunkan dosamu walaupun sebesar tujuh petala langit dan bumi dan bukit bukit
4178004 ya rasulullah dosa ku lebih besar dari langit bumi dan bukit bukit
4178005 celaka kau hai pemuda tidakkah malu engkau dari tuhan yang akan membalas pada hari pembalasan kemudian bila tiba masanya tiap orang zalim akan dituntut oleh orang yang dianiaya kau birkan saya telanjang dan kau hadapkan aku dihadapan
4178006 hai fasik alangkah layaknya engkau masuk neraka keluarlah dari sini
4178007 ya tuhannya nabi muhammad nabi adam telah mengampunkan aku maka beritahulah kepada nabi muhammad dan sahabat sahabatnya jika tidak maka kirimkan pada aku api dari langit dan bakarlah aku didunia ini dan selamatkan aku dari siksa akihirat
4178008 seharusnya orang yang berakal memperhatikan kejadian ini dan mengerti bahawa zina dengan yang masih hidup itu lebih besar dosanya daripada zina dengan mayit juga harus bertaubat yang betul sungguh sungguh sebagaimana pemuda itu ketika taubatnya benar benar maka
4178009 hai orang yang beriman taubatlah kamu kepada allah taubat yang nashuh sesungguh sungguhnya
4178010 tawaran tuan raja itu baik tetapi bagaimana andaikan pada suatu hari saya bermain main dengan babu raja bagaimana tuan raja akan berbuat terhadap aku
4178011 saya telah mempunyai tuhan yang sangat pemurah andaikan saya berbuat tujuh puluh kali dosa nescaya tidak murka dan tidak mengusir aku bahkan tidak dikurangi rezekiku maka bagaimana saya akan meninggalkan pintu tuhan dan pindah pada orang sudah marah kepadaku sebelum aku bersalah maka bagaimana kalau benar0benar engkau melihat aku telah berbuat salah dosa itu
4178012 dosa ada dua macam iaitu dosa antara kamu dengan allah s w t dan dosa antara kamu dengan semua manusia adapun antara kamu dengan maka siapa yang melakukan tiga syarat ini tidak bangun dari tempatnya melainkan sudah diampunkan oleh allah s w t kecuali jika ia meninggalkan salah satu fardhu yang diwajibkan oleh allah s w t maka tidak berguna taubatnya selama belum menyelesaikan kewajipan terhadap dirinya itu lalu menyesal dan istghifar adapun dosa yang terjadi antaramu dengan sesama manusia maka selama mereka belum menghalalkan maka tidak berguna bagimu taubat
4178013 adakalanya seorang yang berdosa selalu teringat akan dosa dan menyesal serta minta ampun sehingga ia masuk syurga sehingga syaitan laknatullah mengeluh celaka diriku andaikan aku tahu nescaya tidak aku jerumuskan ia kedalam dosa itu
4178014 sabar tidak keburuan dalam segala perbuatan itu baik kecuali dalam tiga macam iaitu
4178015 sesungguhnya allah kasih pada orang yang taubat dan kasih pada orang yang suka bersuci
4178016 tatanazzalu alaihimul malaikatu alla takhafu wala tahzanu waabsyiru bil jannatillati kuntum tuadun

4178019 siapa yang mengejek seorang mukmin kerana dosa maka ia bagaikan yang mengerjakannya danlayak bila allah menjerumuskannya kedalam dosa itu dan siapa yang mengejek orang mukmin kerana suatu dosa maka ia tidak akan keluar dari dunia sehingga melakukan dosa itu dan terbuka rahsianya dimuka umum sehingga merasakan malunya

4178075 is it possible to find a single instance in scripture of accepted worship that was not prescribed by god
4178076 the devil has seldom done a cleverer thing than hinting to the church that part of their mission is to provide entertainment for the people with a view to winning them providing amusement for the people is nowhere spoken of in the scriptures as a function of the church
4178077 the need is biblical doctrine so understood and felt that it sets men aflame
4178078 when christian men have got somewhat accustomed to defend one true position the assault is directed to another and perhaps from a new quarter it may safely be affirmed that
4178079 wherewithal with what or how shall i come before god and bow myself before the most high
4178080 the whole counsel of god concerning all things necessary for his own glory mans salvation faith and life is either expressly set down in scripture or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from scripture unto which nothing at any time is to be added whether by new revelations of the spirit or traditions of men nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the spirit of god to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the word and that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of god and government of the church common to human actions and societies which are to be ordered by the light of nature and christian prudence according to the general rules of the word which are always to be observed
4178081 there is a strange fallacy which seems to mislead men in forming an estimate of the soundness and importance of this principle
4178082 now it should be quite sufficient to prevent or neutralize this impression to show as we think can be done
4178083 1st that the principle is taught with sufficient plainness in scripture and that therefore it ought to be professed and applied to the regulation of ecclesiastical affairs
4178084 2d that viewed in itself it is large liberal and comprehensive such as seems in no way unbecoming its divine author and in no way unsuitable to the dignity of the church as a divine institution giving to god his rightful place of supremacy and to the church as the body of christ its rightful position of elevated simplicity and purity
4178085 3d that when contemplated in connection with the ends of the church it is in full accordance with everything suggested by an enlightened and searching survey of the tendencies of human nature and the testimony of all past experience
4178086 and with respect to the connection above referred to on which the impression we are combatting is chiefly based it is surely plain that in so far as it exists de facto this is owing not to anything in the tendencies of the principle itself or of its supporters but to the conduct of the men who in defiance of this principle would obtrude human inventions into the government and worship of the church or who insist upon retaining them permanently after they have once got admittance
4178087 the principle suggests no rites or ceremonies no schemes or arrangements it is purely negative and prohibitionary its supporters never devise innovations and press them upon the church the principle itself precludes this it is the deniers of this principle and they alone who invent and obtrude innovations and they are responsible for all the mischiefs that ensue from the discussions and contentions to which these things have given rise
4178088 the reading of the scriptures with godly fear the sound preaching and conscionable hearing of the word in obedience unto god with understanding faith and reverence singing of psalms with grace in the heart as also the due administration and worthy receiving of the sacraments instituted by christ are all parts of the ordinary religious worship of god beside religious oaths vows solemn fastings and thanksgivings upon special occasions which are in their several times and seasons to be used in an holy and religious manner
4178089 in athletics we will focus on identifying resources recruitment retention and the health of our athletes and of course graduating productive students

4178094 people are hurting for money and a really good bike can cost a few hundred dollars and they just dont have it
4178095 its taking something disposed of and turning it into something you can use

4178099 theres just a lot more need out there right now

4178105 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication
4178106 while we have reports that president bush had some kind of conversation with putin at the olympics it is hard to say at what level messages are being delivered to the powers that be in moscow and i think if the u s is going to be effective we have to let the russians know directly that we think this is not acceptable behavior in the 21st century

4178121 we said we cannot turn a blind eye to these patients they are pleading please help so we cannot just ignore that we dont have the millions to cover so many iraqi patients so we said lets try something else
4178122 in many cases children come with diseases who have just advanced to a level that you cant give any curable treatment
4178123 if you saw the patients months earlier six eight 10 months earlier you can do many other things that now just arent doable
4178124 we tried to get her into a hospital in iraq and the doctor kicked us out
4178125 there was shooting and firing outside we fought with the doctor we fought to get her in i lost all hope
4178126 i was watching my daughter die in front of me slowly and there was nothing i could do
4178127 we dont know what will happen when we open safaas abdomen and we take this tumor out
4178128 safaa has a chance of survival definitely if he survives today so today is the most critical day in safaas life
4178129 this is such a happy occasion you brought happiness into the hearts of parents
4178130 i will tell you the truth tears come to your eyes youre saving a life
4178131 when you look at somebody that had a life threatening problem and you could with money save that life youve got to sit back and say you helped make this world just a little better and thats what its all about

4178261 the decision to send the american military even on a humanitarian mission deepened the united states commitment to georgia and americas allies in the former soviet sphere just as russia has been determined to reassert its control in the area
4178262 on a day the white house evoked emotional memories of the cold war a senior pentagon official said the relief effort was intended to show to russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
4178263 in georgia president mikheil saakashvili who has sharply criticized what he called a failure of the west to support his country declared the relief operation a turning point in the conflict which began on thursday when georgian forces tried to establish control in the breakaway region of south ossetia only to be routed by the russians
4178264 we were unhappy with the initial actions of the american officials because they were perceived by the russians as green lines basically but this one was very strong he said in a telephone interview after mr bushs statement in washington
4178265 the sum effect of bushs statements was to turn what had been a cautious approach from washington into an aggressive one and it raised the possibility of a sharper confrontation with moscow
4178266 bush noted that russian armored vehicles were blocking access to the port city of poti and that russia was blowing up georgian vessels bush said gates would launch a vigorous and ongoing humanitarian mission by both air and sea
4178267 an attempt by u s naval vessels to deliver humanitarian aid to poti could sharpen washingtons confrontation with moscow and put the u s in the middle of the crisis it is not clear yet where the u s will be delivering the aid nor whether any russian naval forces rather than just armored personnel carriers are involved in blocking poti but the comparison to the berlin airlift is unavoidable and both rhetorically and practically the administration has clearly decided to go in that direction
4178268 the new words and actions from the white house came after sharp criticism from conservatives including some in georgia and the bush administration that his initial response was ineffectual
4178269 profiles in courage here looking out the window he said acknowledging his discomfort
4178270 the many many years that ive been in washington john mccain is far and away the most emotional politician i have ever met people dont understand that so they keep talking about his temperament his temper he reacts emotionally therefore unpredictably
4178271 ive heard every story and then some he once said
4178272 and ive heard satin sheets to lie on and satin pillows to cry on a thousand times i t was a great place to learn about life i had wives call up wanting to know if their husbands there and im answering the phone at 9 years of age and id say well he said he isnt here so i learned the hard way about a little bit of diplomacy
4178273 this all seems very interesting and even perhaps convincing but i wonder if theyre bullshitting a bit on some of these superficially plausible statistics
4178274 from the fringe of lunacy to the fringe of policy
4178275 a so how what u mean will it happen as i am 14 explain to me properly thx pls
4178276 as long as you didnt ejaculate ie shoot into her private part it wont happen fullstop youre only 14 can you spend more time in your study
4178277 today my friends and i had some fun activities and during one game a guy accidentally fell near me and his private part is very near to mine im worried will i get pregnant
4178278 if you were to discount the fact that ukraine is a transit point for russian oil and gas i think georgia stacks up as one of their largest trading partners
4178279 would be a ukrainian or turkish nato peace keeping mission which would only further piss off russia
4178280 ive been topless on the beach in france but i feel that for a business environment this is like the proverbial nude calendar round the water cooler which this society has decided is no longer acceptable this is about these womens futures and they may not realize it yet but they may now face issues in the future with being treated equally in the workplace
4178281 but i decided i needed to see how this business would impact the building
4178282 i mostly work with men so to have my clients know im in the building or for them to come to the building would be really inappropriate
4178283 its fine to wear bikinis on the beach or in dance clubs
4178284 i wear bikinis on the beach but this is not an appropriate business to have in the downtown core this building also houses the friends of the library the friends of the columbia gorge and multnomah public defenders when i first started work i did dress sexier and showed more skin but i was not taken seriously as a professional
4178285 theres so many strip clubs in portland and nobodys protesting against them also theyre bringing in quite a bit of business because people see them and then come in and buy a coffee
4178286 if they dont like our coffee shop then maybe dont look this way when they walk past
4178287 they say theyre for womens rights but they dont seem to support or respect our rights to work here we work really hard to stay in shape and i think what were doing is just like hooters but i dont see these ladies protesting at jantzen beach
4178288 these women are just doing their jobs and should be allowed to continue
4178289 my boyfriend was in here yesterday and he said it was a little creepy so i brought my friends along to check it out i feel like its a little bit of a disconnect between coffees and bikinis it would be like connecting lemonade with tigers its so random
4178290 and we wanted to see how far they were going to take their concept i think theyre going to get a lot of unpaid for media out of this
4178291 we took a tough hit monday but by the next morning we were back on air via the web and serving our loyal listeners said station manager jennifer mulcare sullivan
4178292 we are going to work as hard as we possibly can to restore our broadcast signal as fast as possible until then we urge everybody to tune in at http www 893wumd org i want to thank all of the people who have called to offer their support
4178293 it only costs 10 percent more to go first class
4178294 there is a fine line between being informative and being exploitative
4178295 its human nature when there is a wreck on the interstate people want to see the blood
4178296 the database needs to be repaired or its not a microsoft access file
4178297 microsoft access has encountered a problem and needs to close
4178298 the israelis should be proud of the fact that georgian soldiers received israeli education and training and are fighting like i dont know what
4178299 when the issues in the balance included completing the construction of the nuclear reactor in bushehr and supplying iran and syria with advanced defense systems it was clear to everyone that with all due respect to the israel military industries profits there are a few things that are just a bit more important
4178300 our family of organizations represents a wide range of opinions on various difficult issues and we do not expect them to adhere to an nif position in every instance
4178301 we expect organizations to share our values in the broad sense and one of the most important of those values is free discourse in the democratic context
4178302 im sure it causes a lot of controversy among nif donors because the fine line between endorsing and tolerating is a huge distinction not a small quibble
4178303 there is already a separate legal system in the territories for israelis and palestinians
4178304 the israeli regime of hafradah separation in english and apartheid in afrikaans
4178305 campaign against israel in the united nations and around the world using terms such as racist and apartheid
4178306 this is not in any sense a civil rights movement but rather the durban strategy of demonization
4178307 jewish monies should be supporting organizations that advocate the dissolution of israel as a jewish state
4178308 an amuta shall not be registered if any of its objectives negates the existence of the democratic character of the state of israel or if there are reasonable grounds for concluding that the amuta will be used as cover for illegal activities
4178309 its pleasant for them and for me too and it passes the day
4178310 it may be hard to prove scientifically but the quantities of milk speak for themselves
4178311 we are used to this as israelis but it is a very complicated situation now
4178312 why is israel helping georgia im so embarrassed about this
4178313 this is a war against jews and they dont even understand it
4178314 russia is in the middle of an act of aggression against georgia
4178315 the attempt to take abkhazia and ossetia is obvious to the whole world as an attempt to create anew the russian empire
4178316 we dont have a glossary of terms that are not allowed
4178317 its not about the specific use of a word but we look at the totality of that organization if their activities as a whole still reflect our values and mission
4178318 historically boycott is seen as a legitimate nonviolent means of expression
4178319 we dont think the idea of a boycott can be generalized to mean its aimed at the destruction of a country
4178320 promote or engage in violence terrorism bigotry or the destruction of any state nor will it make subgrants to any entity that engages in these activities
4178321 that is the essence of the durban strategy demonize and delegitimize israel to the degree that it gains no external support and eventually is unable to function
4178322 i wouldnt say this is a strong consistent pattern but its more than minor leakage ford should take a more proactive approach so its monies are not abused
4178323 participation in civil society discourse and activities regarding divestment boycott and sanctions
4178324 strengthen democratic values reduce poverty and injustice promote international cooperation and advance human achievement
4178325 complete and total isolation of israel as an apartheid state as was done in the case of south africa sanctions embargoes the full cessation of all links diplomatic economic social and military cooperation and training between all states and israel
4178326 condemnation of those states supporting aiding and abetting the israeli apartheid state and its perpetration of racist crimes against humanity including ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide
4178327 for oman our trade relations with the united states has been really very small in absolute dollars
4178328 nevertheless from such a decision until comprehensive and diverse large scale trade there are still some challenges that need to be met
4178329 omani firms have reportedly avoided marketing any identifiable israeli consumer products
4178330 even the president has had to admit it will not help the consumer in the short run
4178331 as soon as you can prove that it brings down the price at the pump im with you
4178332 weve brought so many bills to the floor for drilling but they dont want to pass that

4178347 anything hitler was blamed for was a way for german generals to wash their memories
4178348 i know it seems its a pet peeve of yours that italians are equated with lousy soldiers running at the first sight of a tommy but i think most of us in here know differently

4178354 that there are people out here who care for them
4178355 the idea was to get kids interested in something when theyre younger and that helps them avoid getting into violence as they get older
4178356 a lot of these students wouldnt have had the opportunity to use a digital camera and to learn
4178357 during the first couple of weeks they just learned how to take pictures before we got into the assignments
4178358 they had this really nice camera and everybody and their uncle wanted to use it
4178359 since theres a lot of abandoned buildings around my neighborhood i figured it would be a good picture to take it really shows how our neighborhood is
4178360 this is my moms boyfriend john he was in the military in iraq for three years when he came home he got another letter saying he had to go back to iraq to do another three years

4178363 in the first few days youll probably quite often confuse the first with the latter like i do now until youve mastered spotting syntax errors in a fraction of a second these typos will be really time consuming

4178366 individuals who purchase an ownership interest in a cid do so with the knowledge of and in reliance upon rights of ownership that exist at the time of purchase the right to rent or lease owned property is a valuable property right that should be protected ab 2259 has strong bipartisan support i am hopeful governor schwarzenegger will sign this legislation
4178367 california currently is among the most lenient of states regarding extreme drunk drivers
4178368 my measure would reduce the blood alcohol threshold from 20 to 15 this decreases the threshold for judges requiring vehicle breathalyzers as punishment for drunken driving
4178369 they are flagrantly endangering themselves and everyone they encounter on the road
4178370 when housing and other non agricultural development extend into agricultural areas farmers can become the subject of unwarranted lawsuits over dirt odor and other customary practices associated with farming the state of california has adopted laws to protect farming but often when agricultural land is bought and sold the purchasers are not aware that these laws exist
4178371 assembly bill 2881 requires disclosure of the states right to farm laws to anyone who purchases real estate within one mile of farmland
4178372 as more and more people move into rural areas it is increasingly important to safeguard california s future food production
4178373 this legislation will help realtors and buyers of rural properties to understand customary agricultural practices thereby improving relationships between farmers and their new neighbors
4178374 the most important pro agriculture bill of the legislative session

4178382 we have seen too many businesses misleading consumers on the safety and efficiency of their indoor air cleaners
4178383 these highly reputable organizations will help cut through all of the marketing noise by assuring that all air cleaners sold in california do not emit unhealthy levels of ozone the main component of smog and that they are safe for californians to use
4178384 we are bringing a world leader in safety and the pioneer of indoor air quality solutions together to provide a solution for manufacturers affected by the regulation
4178385 the combination of unmatched service quality and reputation plus state of the art test facilities achieved through our partnership with aqs will enable indoor air product manufacturers to comply with the new carb regulations within the required timeframe
4178386 with our science driven approach we are dedicated to ensuring that indoor air quality is a priority in providing healthier environments
4178387 the combined forces and expertise of aqs and ul in our support of the carb regulation will help jump start a gradual shift to improve the quality of air we breathe in our homes and our offices in california the united states and abroad
4178388 the wine industry markets wines by region but it lacks sufficient tools to show consumers how wines are made in the vineyard
4178389 tasting is believing by enabling the industry to conduct educational winetasting events consumers can learn more about california wine by tasting regional differences
4178390 the nature and characteristics of wine must be tasted to be fully understood
4178391 this bill will further the ability of winemakers and winegrowers to educate the public through tastings at seminars and other instructional events
4178392 growers need to promote the unique attributes of their regions to remain competitive
4178393 the rapid globalization of the wine business makes it important for growers to differentiate the wines made from their grapes
4178394 residential care facilities provide a vital service to california s seniors yet this is a largely unregulated industry
4178395 within the past year a winter storm left a facility in my district without power for over two days they didn t have heat lights elevators or medical devices dependent on electricity my bill will provide additional protection for residents of these facilities
4178396 important protection for residents of residential care facilities for the elderly during times of natural disasters
4178397 president gerald ford was a cherished member of our desert community and was one of our nation s most respected leaders

4178399 president ford was a true friend and heroic leader and he will long be remembered in the hearts and minds of millions of americans especially here in our community i look forward to joining with the city of rancho mirage to dedicate the post office in the near future

4178404 i am pleased that bi partisan california lawmakers support this measure to better protect californians from pollution our district attorneys welcome the chance to prosecute environmental violators the more tools to enforce california s environmental laws the better
4178405 it is necessary to make sure the public our firefighters and police officers are protected companies who fail in their obligation to our community shouldn t be able to evade their responsibility and put our first responders at risk

4178414 the residents of los angeles county and indeed tourists and business leaders from throughout the world will benefit from this project passing

4178416 being a woman within the framework of speaking about islam and being muslim is an incendiary position to be in i find that speaking to other muslims my islamic authenticity is challenged and questioned as if believing in equal rights for all people not supporting injustice of any kind and being pro social justice makes my shahada declaration of faith less valid people including a coworker last week will literally quiz me on the pillars of islam or details regarding the proper way to pray or verses from the quran that all muslims must memorize in order to be able to pray i find these interactions incredibly insulting and frustrating i self identify as a muslim therefore i am none of this faithful belief infringes on my ability to think that women should have control over their bodies always and under all conditions and that women deserve nothing short of reproductive justice and freedom all the time no matter what that includes everything from access to abortion birth control family planning right to marry or not marry as one chooses the right to an education the right to move freely where and with whomever and wherever a woman pleases the right to work the right to pursue any occupation career or life path a woman might ever want the right to love whomever she wants and the right to protection against all forms of rape genital mutilation assault harrasment domestic violence molestation and any type of intimidation or coercion that puts any girls or women in any kind of danger

4178435 my assembly colleagues are sending a strong message today that california s coastline is an international treasure and we re not going to sacrifice it by lifting the federal moratorium
4178436 i ve been fighting the bush administration s attempts to spoil and soil our coast for many years our beaches have been stained and marine life killed because of oil spills offshore oil drilling will not reduce the price of gasoline any time soon if at all it will put our coastline at risk endanger tourism fisheries and coastal recreation
4178437 two years ago i authored legislation to enable cities in yolo and solano to use the efficient design build method and hire a single company to both design and construct public buildings and related infrastructure and it has been used with great success
4178438 using this cost efficient process the city of davis built their police station a year ahead of schedule and saved 700 000 the solano county government center was completed under budget and nine months ahead of schedule using design build
4178439 for more than 20 years the federal and state government some local governments and the private sector have successfully used design build to save time money and improve the quality of their projects
4178440 in an era of limited local and state resources all local governments need access to tools like design build to deliver vital infrastructure projects quicker for less money and reduced risk this legislation provides them the opportunity
4178441 i encourage the governor to sign this legislation into law and give all cities the chance to use this cost saving tool at a time when city budgets are so strained

4178461 walaupun kita tak boleh kata tidak ada anak muda yang sokong bn tetapi nampak seolah olah tidak ada anak muda yang menyokong bn di sini
4178462 setiap hari semakin ramai anak anak muda yang bersama sama kita kalaupun mereka tidak bersama sama kita mereka juga tidak ada di sebelah sana
4178463 walaupun merasa sangat gembira pada mulanya saya terkejut apabila bertemu dengan anak anak muda yang memakai rantai emas bertungkus lumus di markas markas dan pos pos kita untuk membantu kemenangan pas
4178464 faktor takut kerajaan tok guru ditumbangkan semakin menjalar di seluruh kelantan termasuk di kalangan anak anak muda yang sebelum ini kita tidak terfikir mereka begitu bersungguh sungguh membantu kempen pas
4178465 sambutan kali ini berbeza sungguh dengan pilihan raya 2004 lalu
4178466 kalau begitu ramai anak muda yang menyebelahi kita itu perkara biasa tetapi terus terang saya katakan kita pun rasa pelik mengapa begitu kurang anak anak muda di sebelah sana
4178467 tetapi kalau perkara itu benar kita berterima kasih kepada khairy kerana wujudnya beliau di dalam umno memudahkan usaha kita untuk mengajak rakyat terutama anak anak muda menolak bn
4178468 di pokok sena juga anak anak muda seperti menjauhi umno dan jentera bn nampak jelas kekurangan anak anak muda
4178469 ada yang tidak teragak agak menuduh perdana menteri bodoh manakala khairy pula dituduh sebagai agen asing yang mahu memusnahkan kepentingan malaysia khususnya orang orang melayu
4178470 tengok sendiri lebih 90 peratus adalah anak muda saya diberitahu mereka memberontak terhadap keganasan polis
4178471 ceramah ceramah yang kita berikan mendapat sambutan hangat anak anak muda ada yang minta lambang mdp sebagai cenderamata lebih dari itu mereka sanggup memberikan tenaga secara percuma untuk membantu kempen kita
4178472 saya boleh kata saya begitu dekat dengan para pengundi melayu di sini saya berasal dari kelantan saya tahu apa yang dekat di hati orang orang melayu budaya dan pantang larang mereka datanglah ke wangsa maju untuk melihat sendiri sambutan mereka yang begitu hangat

4178489 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4178490 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4178491 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia
4178492 among those displaced are people who have had to abandon their homes several times in the recent months
4178493 many people have received basic humanitarian relief but as the number of displaced persons increases so do their needs
4178494 the general security situation in kilinochchi and mullaittivu districts remains tense and unpredictable with ongoing military operations and exchange of mortar artillery shelling and air attacks
4178495 a lot of people are sleeping in makeshift shelters we expect the numbers to climb up from about 112 000 to 200 000 displaced people if fighting gets worse in the weeks ahead
4178496 if at amp t deploys these technologies and processes and we have yet to do so it will do so the right way only after full and careful consideration of the relevant issues and with a particular focus on what we believe are the pillars of any business practices that involve customer information
4178497 if done properly overall behavioral targeted advertising could prove quite valuable to consumers and could dramatically improve their online experiences while at the same time protecting their privacy
4178498 goes beyond the simple practice of targeting limited to a consumers use of individual or related web sites and involves the more invisible practice of tracking consumer web activity across countless unrelated web sites and therefore has unique implications for consumer privacy
4178499 we would encourage any entity that engages in overall behavioral targeted advertising to adopt such principles and urge that any legal or regulatory framework that governs such practices embody these principles and be applied equally to all players in the online advertising ecosystem
4178500 basically four motherboards we put out have this capability and the software vendors have been doing the pr
4178501 we went down into a bunker everything was already burning grad rockets began coming down in great numbers it killed lots of people there was blood everywhere
4178502 you wouldnt believe that this is a spot where a person was almost killed
4178503 the fire was so bad people werent even left with a handkerchief
4178504 we just finished this house where will we live now
4178505 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4178506 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4178507 were going to eventually make a 24 movie one day if fans are still interested by then its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year so we all agreed to preserve the series just to focus on that and then when the series is done we would embark on the film
4178508 my conscience told me that i shouldnt continue to cheat myself and others
4178509 only earlier this year did my wife admit that she had transferred some campaign money abroad
4178510 i dont think it is fair that i should be returned to the united states to face unjust punishment for doing what i felt morally obligated to do
4178511 when i joined the national guard they told me the only way i would be in combat is if there were troops occupying the united states
4178512 through this job i had access to lots of information about what was happening on the ground in iraq
4178513 through what i saw i realized innocent people were being killed unjustly
4178514 im disappointed in the government of canada which seems to be doing the dirty work of the american government in rounding up people that dont want to fight in george bushs iraq war
4178515 kelly was the ultimate host and even when the bar bill began to spiral out of control she refused to close the tab she had 30 very thirsty pals so it was always going to be a pretty big night
4178516 at one point kelly started dancing wildly and put on a silly viking hat much to the hilarity of everyone
4178517 bono arrived quite late and kelly told him to order whatever he liked a good night was had by all
4178518 before we never had problems like this just a few bad people causing trouble
4178519 im feeling really frightened now its not safe at all
4178520 after the incident relevant authorities handled it according to law preserved social stability and the normal order of work and life
4178521 the condom fits 100 perfectly so the safety is much higher than a standard condoms and it feels more natural
4178522 it needs to be ready in five to 10 seconds
4178523 having condoms in different sizes we think is a good and smart idea
4178524 when you develop a new test for something it usually has to go through a fairly rigorous examination does it really do what it claims to do
4178525 bruce like most people in the lab derived most of his strains from outside sources
4178526 you have less confidence in how much the fbi is really sharing and how accurate this might be
4178527 to know what challenge youre defending against is terribly important
4178528 if top fbi officials knew in 2005 that the anthrax used in the attacks came from dr ivins lab then why didnt they clear dr hatfill until aug 8 either they were unsure of the scientific evidence against dr ivins or they knew long ago that dr hatfill was not the killer
4178529 i dont want it to reside in the court of public opinion then well end up with something like the lee harvey oswald case
4178530 there will be too many people in whose minds the case is never closed
4178531 are for india but they are also for the world
4178532 i dont think they knew each other and had any relationship whatsoever

4178535 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4178536 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas
4178537 were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
4178538 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4178539 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4178540 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4178541 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4178542 pinning huckabee down on an issue is like nailing jello to the wall
4178543 the senseless shooting at democratic party headquarters in little rock today is a shocking and sobering reminder of just how depraved our world has become all of our thoughts and prayers turn toward bill gwatney and his family today while we await details on what happened and why
4178544 the aim of the presence of u s forces in iraq is to serve the security and stability of iraq not to use iraq as a base to target the interests of our neighbors
4178545 it is in our interest to consult with our neighbors iran and other states so as not to be misunderstood

4178550 were going to talk to rory kennedy director of a new documentary about the legendary journalist
4178551 veteran print journalist helen thomas has been covering the white house since 1961 when john f kennedy was president and
4178552 shes been covering nine administrations shes been at the front row of the white house and she has extraordinary insight into these presidents and shes also an extraordinary journalist
4178553 where she sits and what she does day after day after day im not sure we value enough
4178554 i censored myself for 50 years now i wake up and ask myself who do i hate today i have never covered a president who actually wanted to go to war bushs policy of pre emptive war is immoral such a policy would legitimize pearl harbor its as if they learned none of the lessons from vietnam where is the outrage
4178555 this is the worst president ever he george w bush is the worst president in all of american history
4178556 theres really a sense that shes a hero for asking those tough questions
4178557 such a huge responsibility that she takes so so seriously and as seriously now as when she first walked in the white house almost 50 years ago
4178558 this is the worst president ever he george w bush is the worst president in all of american history

4178562 the persons case of 1929 is important because it marks the moment when canadians could no longer exclude women from universities professions or politics
4178563 it is amazing to see how far we have come and learn about what women before us had to go through

4178581 the bush administration will soon propose regulations to protect healthcare professionals from being forced to participate in immoral practices astonishingly abortion proponents vehemently oppose this they are against the right of doctors to choose not to do abortions
4178582 federal laws protect the right of healthcare providers not to participate in abortion or other controversial practices but the laws are ignored recently two medical associations passed guidelines that could require doctors to commit or refer for abortions
4178583 support morally coercive or discriminatory practices or policies in violation of federal law
4178584 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
4178585 planned parenthood and some media are trying to frame the new regulations as an attack on contraception
4178586 on the contrary the proposed regulations focus on the right of health professionals to follow their conscience and to do no harm it allows medical providers in their professional judgment and substantiated by medical textbooks to determine that abortion is an action that terminates a human life before or after implantation
4178587 abortion advocates are causing a ruckus about a rule that simply requires health agencies to follow the law and not to discriminate against people with moral beliefs against taking an innocent life
4178588 secretary leavitt provided an excellent explanation on his blog its been flooded with negative comments from abortion advocates demanding that health providers do whatever a woman demands
4178589 as patients we depend with our lives on health providers to be moral but if ethical professionals with strong consciences are forced out of the profession patients will suffer the most

4178597 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result
4178598 we have been overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from

4178602 this is obviously a nationwide issue but it is time we took a closer look at what we can do here in missouri to help stabilize a market that is in a crisis situation

4178609 there was no longer this divide between well this is the business side and this is the it side it was one single team focused on an outcome
4178610 hes been very supportive of driving forward our investment in technology and under his leadership we have seen a real increase in the investment in technology in our organization
4178611 our interactions are with groups of leaders most often rather than specifically just one on one interactions between the cio and ceo
4178612 we want a broader set of perspectives coming to the table
4178613 we have been an organization over the years that has really brought people in and developed them internally
4178614 the majority of senior roles filled in the organization are filled from within the organization
4178615 an approach that gets us onto campuses earlier and more often
4178616 they got to spend two to three days a week working in their home
4178617 when i started with the company i couldnt have imagined that someone starting as a programmer in the it department could one day be responsible for the claims process for life insurance
4178618 ive always been proud that this company has allowed individuals to move beyond what might be seen as their initial technical specialty
4178619 its less of what i would call an enforcement mentality and its more of a partnership
4178620 we had a financial representative in the chicago area who put his profile out on linkedin and was contacted from that listing by an individual who was a policyowner with northwestern mutual but his financial representative i believe had retired
4178621 he was out looking for somebody he felt that he could really work with to continue the relationship saw the listing on linkedin read the profile and contacted the financial rep through e mail thats resulted in additional business for the company
4178622 what we see as innovation is making our organization more relevant to our financial representatives policyowners and clients

4178628 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4178629 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4178630 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4178631 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4178632 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4178633 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4178634 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4178635 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4178636 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4178637 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4178638 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4178639 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4178640 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4178641 im intrigued by the constant changing of the challenges every week its something different every season its something different

4178664 digamos que muchas personas me han querido dar consejos y yo agradezco esa voluntad pero realmente para dar consejos a los pilotos y a los deportistas hay que estar ah y saber qu se siente encima de una moto

4178673 in september 2008 the republican party had a big meeting the republican national convention and on that day my dad was officially chosen as the republican candidate for president of the united states
4178674 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4178675 on every issue important to fire fighters senator obama is and has been in our corner
4178676 we cant overlook senator mccains service to our country but we also cant overlook his poor record on issues critical to the financial security of our 290 000 members
4178677 wont become law unless we have a president whos willing to sign it and ill be that president it is unacceptable when firefighters do not have collective bargaining rights
4178678 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4178679 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4178680 as a purist you dont do the beans you dont do the ice cream just the shave ice
4178681 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4178683 these organizations provide a safety net for people who do not normally come to hmrc for help and advice their work is vital because it makes customers aware of our products provides extra help with tax issues and brings customers back into direct contact with hmrc

4178686 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4178687 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4178688 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4178689 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4178690 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4178691 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4178692 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4178696 this story about jolie taking over is completely false this started with an inaccurate report months ago that said cruise was taking the role
4178697 they courted him for almost a year for this movie he considered it but passed
4178698 hes been offered many roles in the past few months were sure to see news about the next project soon
4178699 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4178700 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4178701 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4178702 michael used to run around like a little crazy person mooching food off people
4178703 he could get through homework without moving around so much
4178704 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4178705 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4178706 we have a good balance of guys who keep things loose
4178707 he was a fighter in the nll hes a no b s guy
4178708 if he just raises his voice you can tell hes pissed off ive been on the wrong end of a few of his angry moments so he can get there
4178709 if you see his head come up hes looking where to go just profanity swarm him
4178710 if youre not getting the ground ball make sure the guy next to you isnt
4178711 if garvey blows out his hammy in the first quarter were screwed for the game
4178712 were a deep team a good player isnt dressing tonight
4178713 he understood he wanted to be sure he wasnt losing his job i told him its important that we get his hamstring better it sucks because if you dont dress you dont get paid you get the practice pay but thats it
4178714 ive been fortunate in that ive played in most of the games since ive been here were professional about it the focus is to get the hamstring better cocos played well lately
4178715 mostly everyones professional but there are times when you tell guys theyre not going to dress and you know theyre upset
4178716 what we stress is that if youre ticked off dont bring it in the locker room negative attitudes can spread if three guys are in here mad it can affect the whole locker room so you can be upset but respect the decision and support your teammates
4178717 i tried to duck my head away from the refs so they wouldnt see it and send me off
4178718 it was fine a little blurry here and there got a little novocain in there so it was fine
4178719 theres as much anticipation and preparation and excitement in the house on gameday as there would be
4178720 actually probably more than on a broncos gameday because our house is divided when it comes to football but everyone roots for the outlaws
4178721 they are so fan focused its not uncommon to have your account rep come out to your seats during the game to check on you
4178722 players will swing by practice at one of the schools just to say hello or show a few tips theyre not just sitting back expecting fans to come
4178723 the growth of the game is impressive now but to some degree its held back by a lack of infrastructure
4178724 weve tried to complement a lot of what us lacrosse does in terms of building the infrastructure of the game weve hosted officials clinics we run coaching clinics throughout the year weve made this field accessible we get great support from the players thats had a lot to do with the success weve had because weve gotten into the lacrosse community that was our first audience weve really embraced them and i think were getting a lot of that love back
4178725 i see kids in my class that when i started teaching they had never seen a lacrosse stick and now theyre all playing
4178726 its been amazing the way the city has embraced the team both teams this right here is the center of lacrosse right now
4178727 i said to four men who came into my house take what you want and they said we dont have to ask you it is ours
4178728 when the russian army goes the ossetians come and take everything
4178729 we are poor now nobody thinks about us they play big politics but nobody cares about ordinary people
4178730 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4178731 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4178732 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4178733 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4178734 we got word that special group members were going to be coming down from baghdad into mahmudiyah and planning on resupplying criminal groups in our area
4178735 the most important part of this is that the ip knew their success
4178736 on the surface the outside looking in really not much happened but the leadership at the station knew it was something they took great pride in
4178737 we are at a very critical time in mahmudiyah ip are starting to catch on to things and they are continuing down the right path
4178738 the iraqi people are now taking ownership in the communities and not allowing criminals to come back in
4178739 when the ip come in and put on that uniform they see the leadership is not biased toward any tribe when the case work comes in
4178740 one thing that is really working well in mustafa is that the whole mahmudiyah community is coming together
4178741 ip ia different tribes and the sons of iraq are meeting on a regular basis to discuss issues in the area
4178742 the focus of our convention to people back in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4178743 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the failed policies and old politics that john mccain wants to continue
4178744 over the last year or so weve seen a string of shady characters that have been shown to be members of his wide circle of friends and colleagues and confidants and mentors and influences
4178745 ive got ohio to deal with the last thing i need to do is come to michigan and tell someone what to do
4178746 they outright said if you vote for barack obama this law is going to pass your wages would go down you could lose your job
4178747 i just dont want people to forget about me im still a big i still can rebound and i feel that im a lot stronger than 06
4178748 we wanted to really put the pressure on them and we wanted to redeem ourselves
4178749 this was kind of like a payback game for us we knew that people were wondering how we were going to respond
4178750 i thought we played one of the best teams in the tournament tonight
4178751 i think in 06 i was still trying to find out what that role was
4178752 i was still trying to find myself it was frustrating because i didnt play well and if i wasnt doing what i was supposed to be doing i couldnt play
4178753 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4178754 the ivy league game of the week presented by tiaa cref
4178755 the entire ivy league community is thrilled to have the heart of our football season broadcast nationally this year by versus and we appreciate strong support to make it possible our students and home communities and our alumni around the country as well as college football fans everywhere will be able to watch top notch football and celebrate great rivalries
4178756 ivy league football has an incredible legacy supported by a passionate fan base and we are thrilled to now have the opportunity to present these historic rivalries to a national audience
4178757 the addition of five ivy league games to the networks 2008 schedule will undoubtedly help solidify versus position as a top television destination for college football
4178758 she pushes boundaries where i wouldnt and she has a lot of fun she thinks she is so mature but shes really young and innocent she has a good heart and she loves her family
4178759 i was in the middle of a scene and i saw i had a missed call then could hardly wipe the smile of my face for the second take i was with a colleague and we just screamed
4178760 from shea stadium to madison square garden new york really gave birth to rock and roll
4178761 have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops
4178762 buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices
4178763 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4178764 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4178765 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4178766 whether you are bob kearns or ghandi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4178767 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4178768 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4178769 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4178770 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4178771 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it
4178772 were clearly focused on moving ford forward and tomorrows innovations
4178773 the sec is the gold standard for college athletics it has been a great conference for 76 years and that will never change we love the enthusiasm and the way the fans support the game
4178774 but at the end of the day the comfort level is so great and the trust is so great that we decided to lock this in for the long haul

4178780 you think if theyre intelligent and all the other person and have a good sense of humor that they dont give a damn whose suitcases are better but they do they really do
4178781 we will be closed saturday 8 16 08 we will resume our regular hours on saturday 8 23 08 and be open 11am 4pm
4178782 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets
4178783 no no no thats supposed to be bailys not emmets
4178784 but it says bailys 4 00 right here on the check
4178785 if similar situations arise in future where someone with a similar sort of background to dr tomeu and similar issues comes before council again then clearly whats happened here informs the decisions we make in future
4178786 youve got to add this additional information in your future decision making youve got to learn from this and you do learn from this
4178787 there are some specialities that are more at risk than others and o and g obstetrics and gynaecology is one of those
4178788 jika kamu ingin mengenal tuhan anda harus mengenal dirimu sendiri
4178789 yau dont think what you are you are what you think
4178790 the time resources and money that miag will cause silver fern farms to waste on court action defies belief
4178791 that provides us with a huge challenge in terms of sustaining our services
4178792 because just inflation costs within health care is above that
4178793 i think that were probably in a position that all three in fact are going to have to be looked at
4178794 what it does mean is that we should be investigating and taking a look at the nature of those malpractice suits which weve done as part of our recruitment process and which the medical council of new zealand did as part of his registration process and weve both come to the conclusion that dr tomeu in his 20 years practice in our view met the criteria for appointment
4178795 this is a tragic event and i dont want to downplay it i am deeply sorry that that has occurred within our facility but we dont believe that as a district health board we could have done anything different to avoid that

4178799 saya pikir ini dalam proses menuju identitas kewarganegaraan tapi kalau ke depannya ini terus berkembang ini bahaya karena hanya akan mementingkan kepentingan kelompoknya sendiri
4178800 misalnya dalam pilkada orang memilih calon atas dasar kedekatan etnisitas atau putra daerah dalam hal konflik yang sudah pecah maupun potensi itu karena etnisistas dalam pemekaran wilayah setuju atau tidak setuju itu karena alasan etnisitas
4178801 nah ini dia masalahnya keduanya berkembang jadi yang muncul adalah politik etnisitas ini bisa dimanfaatkan pilkada pemilihan langsung jalan pintasnya adalah menggunakan pendekatan etnis dengan mencoba mengajukan kampanye perbaikan daerah daerah tertentu dan sebagainya
4178802 kita tidak mengatakan salah dengan politik etnisitas selama mereka berjuang juga untuk kesetaraan politik lain halnya kalau minta diistimewakan artinya tidak ada yang menjamin kalau dia tidak memarjinalkan kelompok lain
4178803 area kontestasi di mana kelompok kelompok sosial yang kuat dan ideologi politik yang saling bersaing
4178804 while we have reports that president bush had some kind of conversation with putin at the olympics it is hard to say at what level messages are being delivered to the powers that be in moscow and i think if the u s is going to be effective we have to let the russians know directly that we think this is not acceptable behavior in the 21st century

4178809 of the corporations by the lobbyists and for the very rich
4178810 weve accepted that some people are going to have to leave the industry and they need to be paid weve asked the government for the chance to exit with dignity through restructuring funding
4178811 they told me at the meeting to go back and tell our members that this is the volume available and you have to restructure to fit that volume and they wont be funding the change
4178812 weve just about had a gutsful of the situation the government has a moral and political obligation
4178813 these are complex issues and affected by events outside our control the ministers are being kept informed of the views of the timber association
4178814 since christmas last year weve received less than a third of our volume from the west coast
4178815 they were rubbish short logs and small logs normally wed recover just over 55 per cent milled timber but it went down to just under 35
4178816 you cant make money doing that all the mills on the coast are in the same position
4178817 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4178818 we were all scheduled to go and meet with the troika the sadc organ on politics and defence
4178819 as everyone is aware for any foreign travel one needs travel documents and mr tsvangirai does not currently have any such documents
4178820 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4178821 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
4178822 would be accommodated in the new government when he was ready to sign
4178823 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4178824 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4178825 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4178826 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4178827 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4178828 they are destroying everything in poti port they are destroying the newly built roads in western georgia
4178829 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4178830 it is a pity however that the american side steadfastly refuses to recognise the real reason for what happened
4178831 that the regime of mikheil saakashvili in violation of all of its international obligations launched a war against the south ossetian people

4178851 im a little disappointed in myself not to make a better decision not to do batting practice but it was a once in a lifetime opportunity
4178852 he was the big superstar when i was just starting to play
4178853 ive always known him but hes only known me for four years
4178854 i was playing so bad that it wasnt even fun
4178855 helen never inspires me you can put that in bold print
4178856 in terms of strength of field its not going to be the best this year
4178857 i like to think of it in meters 610 its like nothin
4178858 think about it last year you had one guy who could win now anybody can do it
4178859 i mean you never want to be without woods but its exciting
4178860 we have some great great players on the lpga right now i think if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
4178861 theres a major coming up and im not even in it
4178862 he told me what a wonderful golf tournament it was
4178863 its definitely a good test for me to go the next two weeks after this tournament
4178864 if marrying a tennis star is the secret to good golf hank kuehne should be tigers next rival
4178865 he is clearly burning that many calories if he wasnt he would look chubby
4178866 its interesting if he wasnt eating that many calories he wouldnt be winning because he wouldnt have the energy
4178867 the carbs is what the body uses for energy you have to give the body glucose to fuel it thats why people on the atkins diet an all protein diet cant work out

4178876 very hard to relate to humans and sun induced skin cancer
4178877 moisturiser use is much greater among women however skin cancers and in particular the type of skin cancers studied in this research seem to be more common among men
4178878 the potential for alarmism is high and therefore this paper invites the highest level of scrutiny which it does not in my view sufficiently bear to warrant publication

4178892 there was something about this story that i felt so personally committed to
4178893 ive always had a lot of respect for average working people
4178894 bob wasnt an ordinary man he was probably a genius but as a person his lifestyle his family scale he was just an average guy so i felt like i understood that
4178895 whether you are bob kearns or ghandi or martin luther king if you go up against the forces you will pay
4178896 hes an addict in some ways he wants to give it up but he cant
4178897 i think they had a leg to stand on in a certain way
4178898 i think they thought we would have come up with this anyway based on the amount of time and energy and research and people we had on it
4178899 but i dont think they had come up with it yet and what bob kearns came up with whether or not it was the most revolutionary idea anyone ever had was bobs idea they were denying him his dignity
4178900 it shows that there is justice in the world that you cant steal something and get away with it

4178902 healing doesnt involve conversion a growth in wisdom a new higher way of seeing the world or at least these are not the hinges of healing though they may be among its results

4178908 my analyst doesnt make me feel unworthy hes waiting there patiently for me everyday i think the person i really want to snub is my father hes the one who made me feel worthless
4178909 it involves a hermeneutic an attempt to understand the meaning of our unease
4178910 unease needs to be further understood worked through perhaps in prayer or meditation
4178911 needs to be got rid of or at least rendered mild enough to be lived with

4178933 its hard to believe that a private school established just 10 years ago in a former roadside bar offers a more credible dropout recovery program than 22 public school districts whose applications for a grant were rejected just as interesting is that this private school would get public tax dollars just as james leininger turns off his money spigot for a privately funded voucher scheme that allowed the school to open in the first place
4178934 its hard to believe that a private school established just 10 years ago in a former roadside bar offers a more credible dropout recovery program than 22 public school districts whose applications for a grant were rejected
4178935 just as interesting is that this private school would get public tax dollars just as james leininger turns off his money spigot for a privately funded voucher scheme that allowed the school to open in the first place
4178936 james leininger has failed repeatedly to get a private school voucher scheme through the legislature
4178937 now the governors handpicked education commissioner has twisted the legislatures intent by creating a backdoor voucher scheme that puts public funding for private schools ahead of our neighborhood public schools

4178943 it is completely irresponsible and arrogant for the mayors office to take this tack monosyllabic non responsive grunts in answer to fair questions are an insult to the citizens of knox county i expect to at least get complete words out of them
4178944 if one syllable grunts are all the mayors got left fine after we get done raking em over the coals on the slush fund audit theyll be grunting big time i guarantee it screaming and howling too
4178945 certainly i would like answers in the form of complete coherent sentences that can be diagrammed grammatically i would also prefer simple sentences although compound and complex would be acceptable too but i think the mayors office just wants the audit judged on the facts and they want due process on those facts and to me at this point in time more words from the mayors office might just confuse matters so as a matter of form it might be better for all concerned at this time for the mayor to just say huh after all
4178946 i cant hear you i cant hear you nah na na na nahhhh

4178951 fijn leuk en lekker mens ik wens zijn familieleden en met name zijn vriend veel sterkte joh als je iemand op die manier aantreft in huis daar heb je tijd voor nodig om dat te verwerken
4178952 ik denk de hele tijd dat het niet waar is
4178953 nog zo jong ik geloof gewoon niet dat je kan vallen en je nek zo kan breken het was een superlieve enthousiaste man ik zal hem herinneren als een vrolijke modeontwerper met een geheel eigen signatuur
4178954 je komt elkaar tegen op premi res en feestjes en dan hadden we altijd belangstelling voor elkaars werk
4178955 dit is echt nieuws dat even tot je door moet dringen ik had altijd veel respect voor hem hij was zichzelf en hij maakte gewoon mooie dingen
4178956 hij genoot van alles wat hij deed en dat maakte het inspirerend om met hem te werken
4178957 wij waren heel intensief met hem bezig met de fashion week er valt echt een gat percy was een heel flamboyant figuur en zo waren zijn ontwerpen ook heel uitgesproken heel feestelijk en heel spectaculair vol drama
4178958 wat een einde voor zon talentvolle zachtaardige en inspirerende man
4178959 als ik denk aan al het moois dat je nog in je had en wat nu nooit meer gemaakt zal worden
4178960 we zullen jou en je fantastische creaties missen je laat ons in verbijstering achter

4178962 since june senators obama and clinton have been working together to ensure a democratic victory this november they are both committed to winning back the white house and to to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4178963 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4178964 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4178980 it could be argued that those global emissions contributed to the melting ice of the endangered polar bear
4178981 these modifications would clarify that the consultations are required only when a direct causal link can be made between a proposed action and an adverse effect on a species or its habitat
4178982 the proposed regulatory changes unveiled yesterday are designed to serve one purpose only to reduce wildlife protections under the esa they have been long sought by industry and other opponents of wildlife protection
4178983 the bush administration is trying to slip them through the door at the last minute
4178984 test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at
4178985 truly a high tech oriented society that maintains strong industrial and academic investments
4178986 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4178987 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4178988 the problem with supply chains is that many are still organised in silos and if you cut carbon in one of these areas you can end up increasing emissions in another area
4178989 we are all aware of the idea that you can cut emissions from flights by importing flowers from the netherlands instead of africa for example but now studies have shown african flowers have a lower overall carbon footprint as they do not require heated glasshouses
4178990 the cross functional approach to supply chain management that has been part of management theory since the eighties
4178991 the statistics indicate that pressure ulcer incidence is rising in all environments and obviously long term care will acquire some of this population from home and hospitals
4178992 patients are living longer with more complex conditions and thus become more at risk for complications
4178993 this is why completion of the healing process is the toughest phase because even though we think it may be healed due to visualized assessment the tissue due to tensile strength issues is still very fragile
4178994 our bodies only recover to at best 80 of the tissue strength we were born with and that is if all conditions are ideal lets face it wound relapses arent due to disease processes many homes remove the bed increase sitting and fail to toughen the tissues which leads to a reopening of the area
4178995 this dressing category is important to wound healing as a primary treatment when these conditions exist but they can create negative results when used in moderate or heavily exuding wounds
4178996 most silver dressings have more longevity so that even though the dressing may cost more initially in the long run it costs less due to a decrease in the need for nursing time
4178997 when i was a don the hardest shift was 3 to 11 p m
4178998 it used to be that hospice residents were not even considered as having an avoidable wound it was a given that they would now any pressure area with no proof of preventative care within the two to six hour time frame is considered a reason for a citation this means that the tide may change once again putting skilled cares back to the wall since many of cms requirements are not easily understood
4178999 the stage i ulcer has been redefined as well as clarifications for other existing stages
4179000 now stage i could be not only what we visually see but what the resident feels painfulness and itchiness of a specified area may herald a stage i along with darkening shadowing bogginess and it doesnt have to be a bony prominence tissue to tissue contact now counts many nurses were taught to stage by depth and the new consensus addresses the shallow nature of a wound and how it may be a stage iii or iv
4179001 that means a facility may have 10 community acquired and one facility acquired areas and because all are reported in the same fashion it may flag the facility as having a wound issue
4179002 additionally we are forced to back stage the wound on the mds meaning that as the wound heals less money is rendered for care even though a stage iv is always a stage iv hopefully this will soon change
4179003 for instance incontinent residents are at the highest risk for skin breakdown so it is vital that staff use a high quality perineal care product every time an absorbent garment is changed
4179004 it is important that the skin maintain its acidic mantle so three in one products that are ph balanced that cleanse and moisturize while protecting the skin are highly useful in promoting skin health this greatly helps prevent the risk for wound development
4179005 there are three phases of treatment and any phase can stall if the principles of healing are not followed or issues are not recognized including soft tissue or bone infection poor nutrition or dehydration improper patient off loading or poor perfusion
4179006 staging wounds is largely misunderstood as is measuring so i find nursing staff benefits from education in these areas
4179007 cnas could benefit from more education on posturing techniques and equipment utilization
4179008 it forces everyone to take their boxing gloves off and respect each other for the jobs they perform
4179009 this suggestion that plaintiffs should be resigned to participate vicariously in civic society is shocking offensive and wrong it echoes the sentiments of those who challenged womans suffrage suggesting that women should be content to participate in the political process vicariously through their husbands votes

4179030 im obviously happy that we were able to pull off this bid more importantly i think the challenge was just being able to bid the job having that opportunity that really was my battle from the start
4179031 university officials awarded the contract to hamocon even though he did not have the synthetic turf license recommended by the state contractors license board which oversees contractor licenses before the bidding opened last month david hafner uh assistant vice chancellor for campus services said he was concerned about skirting the boards recommendations because it could lead to a protest a formal objection that could delay work but that concern was erased because hamocon was the low bidder
4179032 rmy construction a general contractor and hamocons company as subcontractor bid about 21 500 less than the next bidder applied surfacing technology a dispute on the cooke field project erupted last month when hamocon said denny sadowski a member of the contractors license board and the listed agent for applied surfacing technology tried to limit his competition by asking the board to require a special license for synthetic turf jobs in october the board voted in favor of sadowskis recommendation that contractors have a special license to install synthetic turf at sports stadiums in hawaii the decision reduced the number of contractors that can install synthetic turf at sports stadiums from hundreds to four one of which was applied surfacing technology
4179033 what it comes down to is what hes done in his position is wrong the fact is theres definitely a conflict of interest
4179034 the board started tackling the issue in july 2007 when a contractor asked the board whether landscape contractors needed a special license to lay synthetic turf said board executive officer verna oda sadowski the synthetic turf expert on the board brought up his special licensing recommendation in august oda said
4179035 hamocon who is a landscape contractor said he did not know of the boards revised opinion until he began preparing a bid for cooke field recently he worried he was disqualified from the project despite having laid synthetic turf at les murakami stadium mark carr who represents the synthetic turf manufacturer domo sports grass questioned why the board never requested input about synthetic turf work from him or hamocon who was working on the largest synthetic turf job in hawaii at the time murakami stadium
4179036 if dennys the expert on this board then he knew who should have been called in to talk about this they never called logan or me
4179037 they hamocon and carr werent even on the radar at the time
4179038 the criteria in the awards process are extremely robust and every aspect was judged

4179045 once it hit quality assurance the reaction we got was man this sure is different than the other rpgs that have come through here and that wasnt necessarily a positive reaction
4179046 i think the biggest concern was just the amount of text we were throwing at the character not the actual content if that makes sense
4179047 the beginning is very slow and exposition heavy and i dont think that helps get the player into the mystery of his character this is something i tried to correct in future opening levels of icewind dale 2 where youre in trouble the moment you step off the boat in targos also i would work more extensively in creating more dungeon and exploration areas and do another pass on the combat mechanics in the game the story and quest structure in the game ended up becoming the primary focus of design and i think the game suffered as a whole when it came to combat

4179050 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
4179051 there are people in the evangelical community who would have a problem with his mormonism i am not one of them i mean im very clear that i do not believe mormonism is a christian faith but that does not disqualify someone from being president or vice president and my guess would be that probably about 15 to 20 percent of the evangelical community would have a problem with his mormonism

4179072 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4179073 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4179074 look this is a 100 level ge class that i have to take make it easy
4179075 these guidelines were developed using acoems published methodology which incorporates the highest scientific standards for reviewing evidence based literature ensuring the most rigorous reproducible and transparent occupational health guidelines available
4179076 literally thousands of hours of review of the available scientific literature went into this process yielding what we consider state of the art medical guidelines
4179077 this renewal is a strong validation of the strength and depth of the aging research program here at wake forest
4179078 our five year goal is to provide scientific knowledge leadership and resources to formulate evidence based responses to the consequences of increased adiposity
4179079 the pepper renewal and the recently awarded harford center of excellence provide a national validation of the excellence of our aging research and education programs
4179080 our target audience includes researchers in higher education and institutions graduate students teachers school administrators and other educational professionals such as school psychologists and consultants
4179081 the volumes in this handbook will represent the best science and evidence for research practice synthesis in the field in addition unresolved and controversial topics will be explored and needs for further theoretical and research developments critical to the field will be identified
4179082 the way this disease grows and spreads has perplexed clinicians and researchers for nearly three decades during which time the dismal outcome for metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma has remained essentially unchanged despite improvements in surgical technique radiation delivery and chemotherapy
4179083 a therapeutic strategy for children with muscle cancer might be developed that would target this growth receptor and possibly similar ones at the same time
4179084 the benefit to the patient is that such treatments are clinically available today for adult cancer patients who have other diseases importantly too the way these targeted therapies work is less toxic than chemotherapy
4179085 we believe this clearly establishes platelet derived growth factor receptor a as a potential future therapeutic target in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
4179086 moving our results to the clinic will require close attention and further study of how tumors become resistant to this drug
4179087 i dont really mind him talking i just wish it was something interesting you know so i could have something to send into a cool blog or tmz you know i want to be the cool person on the internet for a change

4179113 we are used to being lauded for our achievements but over the last few months there has been a string of high profile road rage events involving cyclists and motorists that have overshadowed our achievements as someone passionate in providing alternatives to people driving alone in their car it is absolutely important that we stay on top this issue
4179114 for heavens sakes if youre a pedestrian you need to look around and see whats going on if youre a motorist you need to look around and the same thing is true if youre a cyclist
4179115 that to drink and drive or to drink and cycle is not the thing to do in portland
4179116 to make portland safer we should all be responsible for following the rules of the road for making our city the place it can be
4179117 it is time that we all just frickin share the road people
4179118 as people drive less the funding for transportation goes down because we are primarily funded by gas tax
4179119 extend that bicycle network in the way we would like to do it
4179120 education is critical in keeping us safe and keeping things moving
4179121 for heavens sakes if youre a pedestrian you need to look around and see whats going on if youre a motorist you need to look around and see if you have pedestrians and cyclists and the same thing is true if youre a cyclist so that eye contact is a very critical part of the equation

4179130 usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4179131 they have both signed the agreement to use our spec instead and will not develop and alternate version
4179132 its a shame that it took the reality of an alternative spec to make this come true intel should have opened it up without this one has to question a monopolist leading a spec like this in the future
4179133 to me its better to not be involved with a customer at all than to start a relationship and then drop the ball

4179158 hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants
4179159 did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
4179160 the dollar has been on a slow decline for years and years exporting is going to continue to do well longer term its still a weaker currency

4179168 change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time we are the ones weve been waiting for we are the change that we seek i have seen the desperation and disorder of the powerless how it twists the lives of children on the streets of jakarta or nairobi in much the same way as it does the lives of children on chicagos south side how narrow the path is for them between humiliation and untrammeled fury how easily they slip into violence and despair
4179169 i know my country has not perfected itself at times weve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people weve made our share of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions the true test of the american ideal is whether were able to recognize our failings and then rise together to meet the challenges of our time whether we allow ourselves to be shaped by events and history or whether we act to shape them whether chance of birth or circumstance decides lifes big winners and losers or whether we build a community where at the very least everyone has a chance to work hard get ahead and reach their dreams
4179170 if you are writing your problem and youre on the fifth paragraph try to edit try to get it to one paragraph and then try to get it to one sentence thats a good exercise in figuring out your own problems
4179171 i have made this letter longer than usual because i lack the time to make it short
4179172 1 is probably just passing on info that their spouse is looking for opportunities
4179173 can you tell me how to find a job in finance
4179174 i havent given it enough thought to know what i really should be asking
4179175 dont get me wrong im happy to validate you if thats what youre looking for i just think we should be clear
4179176 i have some bad news for you five people who agree on anything are probably right

4179182 i want to make a lot of money with no effort
4179183 are you more a social butterfly or enjoy working alone with complete concentration
4179184 if you could have any dream job real or unreal
4179185 i want to make a lot of money with no effort
4179186 you ask me a question when five people have given you an answer you dont like
4179187 early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
4179188 thats not to say that previous generations are lacking in intelligence
4179189 i must get all as and be in all honors classes and play by the rules to get into the best possible college
4179190 i wonder if there will also be an epidemic of neck strain to go along with the video game and social networking induced carpal tunnel because of all this gen y navel gazing
4179191 its just to say that over time each generation is getting progressively better at scoring well on a test that was designed to test the ability to be productive workers in this modern society
4179192 sometimes our efforts to employ technology make things more complicated
4179193 cares more about getting new experiences and learning new skills
4179194 leads to the kind of shifts in thinking that save time and money
4179195 were not afraid to rely on nearly free online productivity tools from unknown companies
4179196 oh my god think of the security risks of having some unknown company maintaining all of your project data and how will teams share data
4179197 nothing will ever see youll be just as cynical as we are one day so theres no use trying
4179198 im a 40yo single mom of 2 the lost generation the one no one ever talks about
4179199 your boss is out to screw you so screw him first
4179200 in nearly every trial we found staff morale runs considerably higher when bosses dont read workers e mail over their shoulders complain about their superior salaries or act in any way like giant self centered assholes
4179201 similarly we found that typical dick manager phrases like i dont disagree can weaken worker disposition by as much as 63 percent
4179202 as long as theyre taking care of themselves and dont expect me to finance them
4179203 it should also be noted however that there is a large pool of data in the psychological literature showing steady in robust increases in iqs in the general population over time the generation under me will as a population score higher than my generation etc thats not to say that were smarter
4179204 it wouldnt be so slow and inefficient if all of these slow old people would just get out of my way
4179205 yes gen x is fighting the war and yes probably there are still gen jones and baby boomers fighting but its gen y thats going over as young 19 20 yr and doing a majority of the dirty work they are a whole generation of people that have lost limbs and will suffer a lifetime of emotional baggage that baggage will carry over into their childrens lives
4179206 the story in todays la times about the 22 year old soldier not wanting to fall asleep because he fears the nightmares he knows will descend on him is not a perspective you will see on clays blog or the very similar equivilants foundthroughout cyberspace
4179207 seven reasons gen y has a lot to learn by 30
4179208 at 18 i thought my parents were washed up obsolete and totally out of it by the time i turned 27 i was shocked at how smart clever and ingenious they had gotten in that time
4179209 your farmer has land in the middle of nowhere if you like farmers i have a farmer for you he owns the land at the end of sworn to secrecy major road in wisconsin and he just sold a bunch
4179210 forget it this is madison dont worry about it if you want to know what to worry about worry about the company
4179211 do you think we parent equally or do you think you do more
4179212 could we just have a normal birthday party no crying
4179213 so much of the business is you what if people start saying bad things about you
4179214 no i told him not to i thought it would be too expensive
4179215 we encourage employers to recruit by having a conversation in the blogosphere
4179216 that stuff is not going to be a problem the problem is that the pr people wont want to let everyone talk to bloggers
4179217 i look over at nino hes never even asked me what my company does i am secretly happy to finally tell him i think he should be more curious
4179218 there are two sides to every pancake no matter how thin the batter
4179219 i probably wont read any more entires addressing your divorce
4179220 there are two sides to every pancake no matter how thin the batter
4179221 heres what happens in every meeting i have with investors they ask about my divorce usually its because the person cares about me
4179222 it allows us to do different products including much smaller products as well as bigger
4179223 its a very expensive bet to produce a new line of larger fuel efficient vehicles rather than smaller fuel efficient vehicles
4179224 we are pleased to partner with chrysler to help maintain jobs in michigan
4179225 for chrysler to become more global and offer a broader product mix they are going to have to go the alliance route
4179226 otherwise it is going to take far too much time to develop that expertise internally
4179227 we said wed keep open dialogue but i think were busy right now
4179228 at this stage there is no formal discussion going on but there was an inquiry
4179229 but were not going to put any nameplate on it until we can be assured it meets all of our standards
4179230 well be there and were going to be there long term
4179231 were going to rebound its just a question of time bottom line is they are holding on for the long term and well see what happens
4179232 you have to pay it all back were hoping they do it
4179233 if there is any way you can bury the hatchet with memphis he is someone who knows how to play this game he hated jerry man
4179234 hes gonna kill himself at some point i told him he didnt make too many friends by what he did and he said he doesnt care his goal is accomplished by doing something like that which is ridiculous
4179235 keesha is being cocky and knows she isnt going home

4179245 john isnt a flashy superstar but hes solid and reliable
4179246 the tyranny of the discreet job hunt will be exposed and everyone will job hunt openly
4179247 5 the tyranny of the prudish will be exposed for hurting productivity and coworkers will flirt openly
4179248 who cares what men want women to wear at work
4179249 i wish i could work in a basement room somewhere by myself
4179250 who cares what men want women to wear at work
4179251 the tyranny of tech support will be exposed and they will actually offer help
4179252 now hes at microsoft and his job is to buy companies
4179253 its definitely more efficient to have one person in charge there is a lot of overhead to managing shared care
4179254 is declaring a major trend based on about ten couples
4179255 you try posing with your kids for 6 hours of action shots with no chance to pick the picture you like best and see what comes out from it
4179256 shared care shields people from the reality that their careers are not great
4179257 gen x is not the only generation to earn less than their parents many many people across the age spectrum are underemployed have been downsized etc
4179258 i just want people to talk about it because when i did it i felt really lost and looked for guidelines and a community and i wish i hadnt done so poorly during that time so maybe this discussion will mean well all make good choices for parenting marriage kids or at least well all make better ones
4179259 my second question lies with the idea that generations earn more or less than their parents how is this decided at what age and in what numerical terms
4179260 quit work for a while to have kids your career will be just fine
4179261 there is room in the world for people who dont aspire to the standard american dream
4179262 like a dusky dream huge masses of light gushing at times from the valleys like a golden river then clouds again hanging on the highest peak then climbing down the forest slowly into the valley or sinking and rising in the sunbeams like a flying silvery web not a sound no movement no birds nothing but the wailing of the wind sometimes near sometimes far
4179263 tensions between the united states and russia sharpened as the bush administration suggested that russias objective is the ousting of president mikhail saakashvili who has close ties to the united states and is seeking admission to nato
4179264 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
4179265 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4179266 as far as the georgians are concerned south ossetia and abkhazia are simply part of their national territory to be recovered at all costs promises by nato leaders to bring georgia into the alliance and ostentatious declarations of support from washington have emboldened saakashvili to launch his military offensive against the two provinces south ossetia and abkhazia saakashvili and likely dick cheneys office in washington appear to have miscalculated very badly russia has made it clear that it has no intention of ceding its support for south ossetia or abkhazia
4179267 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
4179268 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland
4179269 that would be like saying and understand that im not making this as a total comparison but it would be like saying hey lets go remake casablanca
4179270 dont worry dont worry maybe maybe we can go find them and wake them up
4179271 we need to leave though it will be dark soon and we shouldnt be out when its dark did you mom and dad ever say that
4179272 ok ok so then maybe we can go and find a place to stay for right now then we can go and look for your mom and pa
4179273 today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4179274 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested
4179275 the war in georgia is a war for the west
4179276 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
4179277 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world
4179278 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
4179279 significant long term impact on relations between washington and moscow
4179280 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
4179281 through incorporating principles of engineering weve developed a language that can describe biology in the same way a biologist would
4179282 the potential here is enormous this opens the door to actually performing discovery science to look at things like drug interactions right on the computer
4179283 we knew that the secret to doing this would be to assimilate fundamental concepts of engineering concepts like modularity and abstraction into the biological realm
4179284 lisp isnt like typical programs its more like a conversation
4179285 when we input data into little b little b responds to it and reasons over the data
4179286 this language is stepping into an unknown universe when your computer starts building things for you
4179287 your whole relationship with the computer becomes a different one youve ceded some control to the machine the machine is drawing inferences on your behalf and constructing things for you
4179288 the next step is to create an interface thats easy to use
4179289 think of web page development lots of people are creating web pages with little or no knowledge of html they use simple interfaces like dreamweaver once weve developed the equivalent scientists will be able to use our system without having to learn little b
4179290 programming with models modularity and abstraction provide powerful capabilities for systems biology
4179291 frieda has been here a long time and is a good hard worker her pay seems right
4179292 for instance a culture of envy is bad for business its best to let each employee negotiate the best salary they can behind closed doors
4179293 you have no idea what goes behind salaries you have no idea what peoples backgrounds are or the plans we have for them in the future you have no right trying to figure out what people make
4179294 its company policy that no employee discuss salary with another

4179313 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4179314 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4179315 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4179375 today the sight that discourages book people most is to walk into a public library and see computers where books used to be in many cases not even the librarians want books to be there what consumers want now is information and information increasingly comes from computers
4179376 a bookmans love of books is a love of books not merely of the information in them
4179377 that is to say i collect hardly anything that is collectible not a thing anyone else would wish to collect
4179378 collecting is a way of linking past present and future objects from the past get collected in the present to preserve them for the future collecting processes present meanwhile articulating the mysteries of desire what people wanted and did not want drives what collectors want and do not want in anticipation of what future collectors will want or not want the mathematical formula connecting these equations of desire is mysterious and difficult but all collectors engage in such calculations usable things sometimes become collectible but collectible things rarely become usable
4179379 collecting is a constant reassertion of the power to own an exercise in controlling otherness and finally a kind of monument building to insure survival after death for this reason you can often read the collector in his or her collection if not in the objects themselves then in the business of acquiring maintaining and displaying them to collect is to write a life
4179380 the lessons of the collections is that collecting is not all pathology indeed collecting can come very close to what is involved in the making of art
4179381 my refuge from the present as from the past is collecting

4179436 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4179437 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4179438 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4179554 der har v ret godt gang i regnskaberne og p n gletalsfronten torsdag og det meste markant m v re william demants nedjustering
4179555 jeg synes at det er et trov rdighedsproblem at william demant venter s l nge med nedjusteringen vi s allerede problemer ved meddelelsen for f rste kvartal og s er situationen forv rret yderligere siden aktien falder faktisk kun p niveau med nedjusteringen p 14 pct og hvis situationen forts tter s burde nedjusteringen m ske v re p 21 pct det ser ikke godt ud

4179577 in the risk and compliance space weve seen an uptick in vendors offering hosted applications and in financial services firms willing to use such services
4179578 theres a fit for saas because its modular its repetitive and it takes significant intellectual capital to build yet it is not something companies want to waste a lot of money on
4179579 the deployment of client software itself forgetting everything else is very traumatic on top of that these firms have a difficult time developing these massive programs so going to saas providers is efficacious

4179598 highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
4179599 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammed as a hostage i have no problem with islam but with the terrorists
4179600 if there was a trial and if there were guarantees we would take part in it
4179601 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologise we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark i cant apologise i respect islam and i did not target it
4179602 blaspheming the prophet mohammed and islam as well as sowing religious and sectarian discord
4179603 we welcome his reasonable approach but in our opinion this person has committed a
4179604 ucr has been a great place for me artistically ive encountered a great deal of self and interpersonal discovery through the relationships ive formed with the diverse student faculty and staff populations the assortment of classes and programs on campus from book arts to planetary physics has influenced my creativity and allowed me to be proud of the work ive done here over the years
4179605 i ts diversity of programs people ideas and cultures it is a small enough campus for students to see familiar faces every day yet large enough for students to have many opportunities to get involved in undergraduate research as well as outside of the classroom experiences it is located in the heart of southern california which makes activities such as surfing snowboarding shopping and sightseeing just a short drive away but you dont even have to leave campus to find interesting and entertaining things to do attend a concert or dance recital at our fine arts center attend our block party in the fall our spring splash in the spring or our weekly nooner concerts every wednesday under the bell tower
4179606 theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money

4179611 coming to uc san diego has been the best decision i have ever made uc san diego is unlike any other school there are six colleges within one great university on campus there are so many ways to get involved and meet people and to learn about yourself the campus is walking distance from blacks beach and only a short drive away from la jolla shores academically the curriculum is challenging as well as inspiring
4179612 uc san diego is a university where youll study among the nations most prominent faculty in a community characterized by open exploration while we expect and receive the highest levels of academic commitment from our students there is also an entrepreneurial air that allows students to follow their spirit of curiosity and inventiveness whether in the arts the sciences or public service

4179615 michigan has always been one of my favorite tracks on the circuit
4179616 we won back to back races there in 2004 and 2005 and i think that a win this weekend is a reasonable goal its always great to win in michigan because its kind of the home track for ford and roush industries i also lived in michigan for a couple of years when i first started racing the trucks for roush in 1998 and 1999 3m is sponsoring the race this weekend so thats even more incentive we usually have a lot of support in the stands up there so if we could win the 3m performance 400 in the 3m ford fusion there would be a lot to celebrate
4179617 i think were behind a little bit i dont think that were grossly behind but if you look at the speed that jimmie johnson and his team produce from time to time the speed that kyle busch and his team have been able to produce we havent been able to do that
4179618 i think we do really well in a lot of areas but weve got to find a way to create some speed
4179619 were a little behind them but again i believe we can get there its going to take a lot of work and a lot of effort right now were a touch behind

4179621 its a place where teaching research and civic engagement intersect with a state of the art medical enterprise cutting edge cultural and performing arts programs and legendary athletics to create a comprehensive learning and growing experience for students from across the human spectrum

4179654 the way this disease grows and spreads has perplexed clinicians and researchers for nearly three decades during which time the dismal outcome for metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma has remained essentially unchanged despite improvements in surgical technique radiation delivery and chemotherapy
4179655 a therapeutic strategy for children with muscle cancer might be developed that would target this growth receptor and possibly similar ones at the same time
4179656 the benefit to the patient is that such treatments are clinically available today for adult cancer patients who have other diseases importantly too the way these targeted therapies work is less toxic than chemotherapy
4179657 we believe this clearly establishes platelet derived growth factor receptor a as a potential future therapeutic target in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma
4179658 moving our results to the clinic will require close attention and further study of how tumors become resistant to this drug

4179667 it will be wise for him to simply say that he wont be engaged in political activity for the remainder of the investigation
4179668 first there is the active work we do with the conscious surface attachments in our life those patterns we recognize and can campaign against to let go of these you pray and suffer and hang on and give things up and hope and sweat the second level deals with deeper more unconscious patterns what merton called our secret attachments to uproot these he cautioned that we need to leave the initiative in the hands of god working in our souls either directly in the night of aridity and suffering or through events and other men we let go our letting go we stop struggling stop saying i will let go i will i will instead having done all we can we allow god to work directly on the more secret and deeply ingrained attachments we have to self we allow god to release us through the experiences encounters and events that come to us

4179745 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4179746 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4179747 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4179748 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4179749 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4179750 really there has been no air activity and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4179751 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4179752 the air corridors are open for us to take the humanitarian supplies in
4179753 they appear to be withdrawing their forces back towards abkhazia and back and to the zone of conflict toward south ossetia
4179754 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today
4179755 well first of all i think we need to take this in sequences getting the russians back inside the zone of conflict and then back inside abkhazia and south ossetia it seems to me is the first objective
4179756 whether they russian forces stay there how long they stay there and so on is as best i can tell a subject that will be negotiated
4179757 ensure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open
4179758 if things are not in perfect balance there will be a counter reaction to make things balanced

4179761 california public school students are continuing to make solid steady progress learning the skills and concepts necessary for success in school and in life
4179762 while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4179763 we cannot lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4179764 it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively compete with their peers
4179765 we pass the time of day to forget how time passes
4179766 the more you know who you are and what you want the less you let things upset you
4179767 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4179768 its hard when youre in a primary election losing is very very difficult

4179770 we are not per se a clinton support group we are a democratic party get your act together support group

4179777 la ltima vez que se intent la fusi n entre aerom xico y mexicana las condiciones de la industria eran totalmente diferentes la entrada de las aerol neas de bajo costo que actualmente detentan 35 por ciento del mercado fue muy importante para incentivar la competencia

4179818 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4179819 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4179820 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4179821 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4179822 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4179825 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4179826 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4179827 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4179828 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4179829 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4179830 likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4179831 p rices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4179832 if you do not want to change your driving will continue to present a risk
4179833 we wanted to create a home destination for wicked interactive gamers
4179834 with all the exciting features and games we have planned for the future gamers around the globe will soon have an awesome place to come together it is going to be one big wicked interactive family
4179835 after the positive experience with the vicious engine during the development of our earlier xbox live title elements of destruction we decided that it made great sense to use the middleware again for our three upcoming games
4179836 so far the production processes for all titles have been smooth thanks to the powerful toolset offered by vicious cycle
4179837 the creative staff at frozen codebase has really showcased the versatility of vicious engine through zombie wranglers and fresco beach
4179838 vicious engine offers a balance of flexibility and stability that is up to any task from developing an action survival comedy to a building simulation
4179839 were excited to be releasing action 4 to the dekaron fans
4179840 the game has grown beyond our expectations since its launch earlier this year and the amount of free content to what is already a huge game is astounding and were confident it can take dekaron to the next level
4179841 theaters are a destination people watch a movie and eat dinner or they have dinner and then watch a movie
4179842 everyone saw the movies made back home in asia and movies were very lucrative
4179843 one of the myths out there is that if someone cheats theyre going to do it again and again
4179844 most people just do it once and never again the guilt the fear that their partner will find out it consumes them
4179845 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee
4179846 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong unified fashion
4179847 she rice will be taking a certain number of documents that will make it possible to consolidate the ceasefire
4179848 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr dmitry medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4179849 the united states of america stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia it is time for this crisis to end
4179850 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4179851 it was underlined that the document should finally be signed by the georgian side as was agreed in moscow the french minister assured that paris is working on this
4179852 but i will tarry in ephesus until pentecost for a great and effective door has opened to me and there are many adversaries

4179870 todo lo que venga para ayudar y hacer m s competitivo el equipo de cara a una temporada muy exigente siempre es un bueno
4179871 tengo muchas ganas sobre todo por el hecho de que me ha llamado otra vez la selecci n y eso es un orgullo aunque el a o pasado no pude debutar este a o tengo muchas ganas de poder hacerlo
4179872 la verdad es que no me arrepent nada fue una decisi n que tom y que tomamos todos en conjunto y que la ten a muy clara era consciente de lo que necesitaba en ese momento y era consciente de lo que me perd en ese momento pero en ning n momento me arrepent segu todos los partidos y me alegr mucho que espa a ganara
4179873 tengo muchas ganas sobre todo por el hecho de que me ha llamado otra vez la selecci n y eso es un orgullo aunque el a o pasado no pude debutar este a o tengo muchas ganas de poder hacerlo
4179874 creo que es un reconocimiento poder participar en una selecci n de este nivel que acaba de proclamarse campeona de europa es una alegr a
4179875 los compa eros nos han felicitado y han hecho las bromas de siempre
4179876 que haya dos jugadores del athletic en esa lista quiere decir que se ha trabajado mucho es importante y creo que va a servir para fortalecer al equipo
4179877 muy bonito pertenecer a esta gran generaci n de futbolistas
4179878 voy a disfrutar aprender y vivirlo todo lo que pueda esto es algo que no voy a olvidar y quiero agradecer la confianza del nuevo seleccionador para m va a ser muy bonito pertenecer a esta gran generaci n de futbolistas
4179879 tengo que agradecer a los compa eros y a los t cnicos pues sin ellos este sue o no se habr a cumplido estoy muy feliz y tengo claro que el list n est muy alto en toda una campeona de europa aunque algunos compa eros ya me hab an felicitado y se comentaba en la prensa hasta que no he escuchado mi nombre no me hac a ilusiones

4179883 este sector pasa por una crisis terminal que requiere una pol tica urgente que evite el exterminio de la ganader a y los ganaderos argentinos que estaremos en estado de alerta y movilizaci n hasta tanto se resuelvan los problemas existentes
4179884 estas contingencias son causales de la dram tica agon a de la producci n ganadera que est disminuyendo su stock de madres todo esto repercutir en el corto plazo en la econom a nacional y adem s en la mesa de los argentinos de seguir este camino se deber importar carne en un plazo no mayor a 3 a os por todo esto y en reclamo por lo anteriormente expuesto declaramos el estado de alerta y movilizaci n entre los productores en defensa del sector
4179885 uruguay hizo un esfuerzo consistente en la apertura de mercados que result exitosa muy importante ahora se empiezan a ver los frutos
4179886 la argentina se ha volcado al mercado interno nosotros exportamos m s de dos tercios de la producci n
4179887 en uruguay no se imponen cupos ni detracciones a la exportaci n
4179888 hay financiamiento del sector privado espec fico para mejorar el ltimo eslab n de la cadena c rnica y as sumar productividad tambi n hay ventajas impositivas para los que invierten en gen tica
4179889 al caso argentino lo vemos por un lado como algo que nos favoreci porque nos dej nichos de mercado espacios libres en los que si los hubi ramos tenido como competencia era muy dif cil entrar por otro lado desde el punto de vista de la producci n lo vemos mal porque no se aplican buenas pol ticas sino todo lo contrario ac todos los candidatos a presidentes siempre coinciden en que no se puede matar al sector con malas pol ticas tributarias
4179890 empezamos a reconocer un pa s ganadero y con una econom a agropecuaria muy importante desde entonces m s all de los gobiernos se sigui la l nea de apoyo al sector
4179891 todo eso estuvo pero los resultados fueron tan negativos que se aprendi la lecci n y se entendi que para un desarrollo progresivo era necesario no volver a eso nunca m s
4179892 era necesario crear un escenario de reglas claras en un mercado libre donde la confianza y la seguridad fueran fundamentales para que los productores se animaran a producir y la industria se expandiera
4179893 todo sin descuidar el consumo interno que tambi n crece
4179894 hay tres cortes accesibles para los sectores de menores recursos y el resto tiene valor internacional

4179897 they say inviting good executioner and i have thin neck
4179898 its been useful to do the work and be able to bring all the information into one place we have always felt that there is a reasonably significant contribution to the local gdp but to actually have it all aligned and in one place is going to be helpful for leaders in the maori community and the wider community
4179899 this holistic snapshot has shown us that maori business has come of age
4179900 the strategic value of the maori business sector cannot be overstated nor can the reports bottom line that developing a taranaki economy of lasting sustainable and significant value will require every aspect of the regional economy to work together
4179901 we think the awareness of hospice is really positive as a result of that awareness we are seeing people who may have been missing out
4179902 the council have endeavoured to be as co operative as they can in resolving the whole matter
4179903 a daily penalty of 10 000 is available to the court
4179904 what we want to do is work with the gibbs to get their building compliant and from what we have seen there are no structural issues with the wharenui at all so we just want to work with them to get it fit for purpose
4179905 we just want to make sure it is safe for people to use
4179906 i am aware they have been utilised around the country as recently as this year
4179907 i know in auckland they have had similar complaints and made similar arrests but they are rare locally
4179908 the risk of relapse was still small but certainly not insignificant
4179909 i think these numbers are somewhat reassuring but they also highlight the need for new therapeutic options for women who have completed five years of treatment
4179910 these tumors are certainly more aggressive early on but the outlook is good for women with these tumors who survive for five years
4179911 we can now tell these women that their risk for developing a recurrence is lower than for women with er positive tumors
4179912 there has been some discussion about whether aggressive treatment makes a difference and this study supports the view that it does
4179913 controlled purchase operations simply test bar owners with what happens every day across new zealand
4179914 i was struck down nine years ago with this hideous disease
4179915 its not just an old persons disorder there are heaps of people around my age who are putting up with this
4179916 i want to create awareness of this disease and promote exercise and weight training as a great help with no side effects
4179917 i want to put a fit face to arthritis not the usual old lady knitting in a chair
4179918 when i was first diagnosed i thought that was the end of bodybuilding for me i thought there was no way i could do it again
4179919 i just want people to know its not the end of the world
4179920 these women were suffering in silence embarrassed and thinking they were the only ones in pain because it has been thought of as an old persons disease they hadnt told anyone
4179921 the reports are he was drinking alcohol but we cant confirm anything until we get a blood result back because that is the most crucial evidence
4179922 he would face court action like any other person and if convicted he would be disqualified from driving
4179923 that is part of the inquiry whether he had permission
4179924 some members do pick up cars earlier if they are on an early shift
4179925 this is a pretty important project for the district and i would be really annoyed if the paperwork got in the way with getting on with the job
4179926 because we are very reluctant to put any more ratepayer money in
4179927 because it costs 60 000 to spray the bonding glue over the ash from the fire and we dont want to have to do that again
4179928 this is a specialist area in terms of asbestos and other contaminant removal
4179929 the asbestos containing ash and dust may well be glued up at the moment but when disturbed it becomes a public health issue it needs to be done correctly we cannot take any chances we also need to assess what other identified contaminants need to be removed
4179930 its manageable but its a big task and we are allowing up to 40 weeks 10 months to get everything finished hopefully starting before christmas
4179931 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical
4179932 but its important for us to get ahead of the curve soldiers are always on the cutting edge of new technologies
4179933 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
4179934 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
4179935 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
4179936 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
4179937 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
4179938 i was so dreading bike shopping because so many used bike shops in the bay area have gotten bad reviews or mediocre reviews
4179939 i sent my future in laws and relatives to the chateau tivoli to stay for the weekend of my wedding
