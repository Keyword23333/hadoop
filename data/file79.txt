790016 we are thrilled and excited that a company in the business of sports and sports nutrition is willing to take a stand alongside us in the anti doping movement and fight for drug free sport
790017 when i first started this company i started out with a product that made an anti doping statement now i want to do more than just say i support clean sport and thats why im taking action
790018 our long term vision is to take this model and apply it to every major sport
790019 we want to share our anti doping knowledge with high schools colleges and professional and amateur athletes of all kinds our mission is to restore all sports to a point that holds participants accountable in and out of competition
790020 we just want to clean up sport in general and support what these organizations do

790043 sit right down with you and just talk to you
790044 the most wild insane and surreal thing ive ever experienced more than 130 000 fanboys and girls over four days clamoring for free goodies cheering their favorite actors and filmmakers and crafting the most colorful and entertaining costumes most of us will ever see
790045 no one really knows who he is because he cant tell them
790046 thats a big burden imagine waking up every day and having a whole part of yourself you cant tell someone about that leads him to question whether or not its worth it and he starts to go the other way kind of a downward spiral
790047 we didnt try to re create it it was an offshoot of the original in my opinion its not really a remake and if it would have been a remake i would have agreed with the fans
790048 and im sure in many ways ive been influenced by my family but only good things came out of it for them
790049 it was in an environment in which because there was absolutely nothing else to do all you could do was school so you got involved in a way that you wouldnt have if you would have gone to school at usc for example where you have more distractions
790050 i feel completely comfortable here and i feel a part of it and stuff but i dont know if ive ever taken it as far
790051 its still enjoyable to see how deep this world goes how far down the rabbit hole goes
790052 so you think you can dance my girlfriends and i have so you think you can dance parties because we think we can dance and we cant
790053 i love documentaries yesterday i was watching an episode of the history channel series ufo hunters i love that stuff its fascinating
790054 sobreseimiento provisional y archivo de las actuaciones para con su defendido
790055 ah perdona es que te pareces much simo a un chico que andamos buscando
790056 truth is what we do is we go where the money is
790057 were telling the whole world about our products and whoever happens to have money are the ones that buy
790058 everybody is agreeing that to be green you have to measure what your problem is how much carbon dioxide emission how much pollution
790059 we do that now especially the physical measurements where national instruments is the major player
790060 from fuel cells to solar cells from windmills to steel mills
790061 what were setting up now is a cutting edge system thats probably a precursor to a lot more of these systems in the u s and around the world
790062 this is a chance to really do a test bed for those type of technologies
790063 it isnt one measurement when you walk out into a rain forest and youre done
790064 you have to deploy a range of sensors and leave it there over time which implies lots and lots of data were the company that supplies the technology for lots and lots of data
790065 is a huge market but it depends on what customers are going to do there
790066 there are so many theoretical applications for what national instruments does so it comes down to whats practical for customers
790067 the good part for us is we can help we can make a difference
790068 we have the technology the combination of measurement and advanced control technology that we can make a difference

790072 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
790073 but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate
790074 we manage our extensive network of ticket agents through our three international offices london new york and sydney
790075 if i failed to recognise this internet scam very few other individuals with less of an e commerce background would have had a chance
790076 so i can empathise with others in the same position
790077 i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime
790078 so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet
790079 the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam
790080 we realise and understand that the ioc are looking to shut down and take further action on that website
790081 but we at the australian olympic committee of course have encouraged everyone all our shadow team members everybody thats part of the olympic family and advertised it very very widely that cosport are our official ticket agent and encouraged all enquiries and everybody to go that way
790082 the one part of the jigsaw that ive not been able to answer is the jobs jigsaw
790083 i think its an enormous opportunity and it fits a piece of the jigsaw thats been missing in our welfare reform drive
790084 the difference from the past is that there has been big corporate drives with indigenous employment but weve stopped short of guaranteeing the job
790085 there are large pockets of unemployment in places like blacktown in sydney
790086 this scheme is about getting corporate australia across the full range of industries not just mining but across a full range of industries looking at their employment workforce and saying listen if we set 1 per cent of our workforce aside for indigenous people and we guarantee people that successfully complete courses are placed in our company were just going to make a big inroad in the aboriginal unemployment problem and therefore the poverty problem
790087 the lessons that we would offer would be to go slowly to mentor indigenous people
790088 there is a remarkable cutthroat battle for market share on the east coast like nothing weve ever seen before
790089 its an achievement nonetheless to be flat in this economy
790090 its a consumers paradise right now with cheap fares galore

790094 this is expected to include some recycling of capital although lend leases strong financial position allows it to choose the timing of selling assets
790095 lend lease will only recycle capital where an appropriate price for assets can be achieved
790096 when we talk about pushing a tests limit of detection or lod were referring to the signal to noise ratio
790097 its really a matter of figuring out how to reduce the background noise and make the signal stand above the noise
790098 we identified a location that has the maximal signal to noise ratio
790099 by focusing on this signal rich point of light we extended the lod by two orders of magnitude
790100 about 90 percent of our time was spent in sample preparation not actually performing the assay
790101 with further integration and automation of the test the time could be reduced significantly
790102 the optical sensor requires a more expensive set up because of the confocal microscope
790103 so in a small dental or doctors office the electrochemical sensor generally would be easier and cheaper to use but to really push down the signal to noise ratio the optical sensor has the advantage
790104 but the technology is advancing so rapidly its difficult to predict how the optical sensor might be used in the years to come
790105 at this point it has certainly pushed the envelope for the limit of detection and this will be an important capability in advancing salivary diagnostics
790106 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
790107 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited weve found that skin cells are actually very smart its in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way

790114 puts me in a great position to keep pushing for el paso
790115 although the committee will not attempt to calculate available funding or identify funding solutions it will work to quantify and describe the need for infrastructure investment over the next 20 years and beyond
790116 in recent years i have seen a sharp rise in the discussion about the transportation challenges we face in texas
790117 from the everyday commuter to large shippers most everyone seems to understand that something needs to be done however before we solve the problem we need to define the problem so we can properly align our limited resources
790118 this committee idea it came before the sunset report came down although im sure they all knew it was coming
790119 we never even brought up the sunset report and our mission is pretty well defined
790120 i brought up whole different aspect of this it wasnt on the agenda i asked research teams if they allocated any research time into impact of mass transit on 20 year plan
790121 they hadnt even discussed it yet so i requested they go out and find out more information on bus rapid transit such as in los angeles and oregon

790132 it would make sense for tata to buy jeep if this partnership went through and chrysler could really do with selling a brand and getting some cash

790135 the lower vehicle production plans are only reflected in the first half forecasts to leave the latter half unchanged while the environment deteriorates is strange
790136 a target of 1 8 billion euros 2 83 billion for the year suggests only 600 million euros 942 million in the second half or half the first half level
790137 decided to stay on the conservative side because of our past track record
790138 there is no direct cost overrun linked to that but you know when we delay milestones in the program it could trigger some expenses

790147 consolidation is inevitable in the chinese auto market which now has more than 100 players and a company of zhongxings size makes a good takeover target or joint venture partner
790148 zhongxing is holding talks with several potential partners including faw and gm to seek cooperative opportunities including possible equity ties but nothing has been decided at the moment
790149 we are a big auto company so we are always out there looking for opportunities and in discussions with everybody around the world i dont actually have information on discussions in china
790150 the talks are still exploratory and the two parties are not excluding any possibilities
790151 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
790152 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
790153 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
790154 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
790155 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
790156 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
790157 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
790158 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
790159 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
790160 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
790161 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
790162 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
790163 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
790164 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
790165 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
790166 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
790167 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
790168 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
790169 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
790170 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
790171 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
790172 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
790173 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
790174 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
790175 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
790176 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
790177 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
790178 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
790179 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
790180 a long awaited report detailing the ontario governments plan to upload an array of services from ontario municipalities is months overdue even as cities and towns struggle against the tide of a slumping provincial economy opposition critics said thursday
790181 its unacceptable that municipalities are trying to budget in the dark with a blindfold
790182 they need to get at this issue and they need to get at it in a big strong way
790183 sarnia mayor mike bradley lambasted the government for stalling on taking back costs he said should never have been dumped on municipalities in the first place
790184 this is the only province in canada that puts social services on property taxes
790185 could have been done on the back of a napkin at a tim hortons on a saturday afternoon coffee session
790186 from the citys perspective we would have preferred the issue had been dealt with prior to the 2008 budget
790187 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
790188 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
790189 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
790190 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
790191 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
790192 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

790196 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
790197 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
790198 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
790199 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
790200 the pullback could provide another negative for u s auto sales this year
790201 people will look back on this as a moment in history
790202 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
790203 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
790204 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
790205 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
790206 its no good saying its just extravagant it could lead to all kinds of things
790207 if youre going to name a mother ship you might as well name it after your mother
790208 even though this is a pretty weird airplane we expect it to fly pretty well
790209 we did expect some kind of adjustments but never did i expect it would be the end of september
790210 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
790211 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
790212 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
790213 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
790214 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

790216 why arent you guys offering these models in the united states
790217 people want to have a car that shows off their status in society no one wants to buy small
790218 the hike in fuel prices last month has done little to damp soaring diesel demand
790219 if you dont have gas you cant get to work and if you cant get to work you dont get paid and if you dont get paid you cant buy food were at their mercy
790220 im a very small businessman if i get any smaller ill be out of business
790221 you have got the dropping of the used car vehicle prices you have got people that are struggling with the credit crunch
790222 it is very difficult right now to offer competitive lease products so we are switching our strategy
790223 it goes through cycles its off a little bit right now
790224 when i first got the news i was hoping that i could have had a second floor on the dealership so i could jump
790225 we really reached a point today in this environment where the economic advantages of leasing have really disappeared
790226 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
790227 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
790228 demand in western europe has deteriorated sharply and there are no signs of recovery in the remainder of the year

790232 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
790233 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
790234 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
790235 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country

790578 she was going to get married you know so many men asked for her hand but she refused them all
790579 this one guys family kept after her but she kept refusing
790580 my daughter is stupid she doesnt deserve such a good marriage i even told her so its her loss
790581 i was told by so many people that his family is one of the best to marry into they are good people morality tradition success he was the whole package a real catch no other girl would ever think twice if she was in her shoes
790582 the plan was that they would get to know each other over the phone and meet later his family said he would even visit her once everything is official
790583 how could she let such a great opportunity pass her by
790584 she says she has plans to keep working and studying the phone idea wasnt appealing to her either she wants to meet whoever asks for her hand in person
790585 you know its very rare these days to arrange a marriage the traditional way the respect between men and women has practically disappeared and its hard to find a good man from a good family who is looking for a girl with the same status
790586 but these days girls just dont want to get married anymore i dont know about your daughter
790587 but she probably thinks the same way marriage just doesnt matter to girls of this generation its no longer a priority the way it used to be back in our days of course you will find those who want to have a family but the majority dont care and neither does the culture
790588 once they grow up and realize the opportunity had passed them by they will regret their decision
790589 when my brother wanted to get married at thirty he asked us to find him a 17 year old girl a friend of my daughters at nineteen had men ask for her hand more than her sisters who was twenty six no one wants the older girl
790590 because honey the man wants a woman who is weaker than him most men are selfish even if they provide for their family everything is always attributed back to themselves i bought them that home or i put my kids through college what they do and have is a reflection of their power and authority me and my husband for example are only two years apart so theres not much of a difference in our mindset he doesnt like it when i talk back to him even if i were only discussing a point of view so you see a man doesnt want his woman to be so educated that she could destroy his authority he prefers to be with a young uneducated girl who will allow him to keep his position as the dominant figure in the household
790591 of course but there are also women who dominate their man
790592 my question is why are you asking us to settle for someone who doesnt want us to be smart we are educated and we want a man who appreciates that
790593 well you can go one of two ways you can either be the dominated or the dominator find a man who will follow you

790595 is the best thing that ever happened to me counting my belly dance career counting my son counting every thing that has ever happened to me of which i wouldnt change a tiny thing

790667 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
790668 i want the michigan delegation and the florida delegation to be seated and however the democratic national committee determines we can get that done im happy to abide by those rules
790669 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
790670 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
790671 during the campaign i strongly advocated for the democratic party to seat the florida and michigan delegation with their full votes the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote today sen obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
790672 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november

790683 i think i was born to compete there were times i wish i didnt have it but i probably wouldnt have achieved what i have maybe there were times the last few months when i wish i had the desire and the motivation and the drive then i wouldnt step away

790930 ever since the 1960s washington has gulled its citizens and creditors by debasing official statistics the vital instruments with which the vigor and muscle of the american economy are measured the effect has been to create a false sense of economic achievement and rectitude allowing us to maintain artificially low interest rates massive government borrowing and a dangerous reliance on mortgage and financial debt even as real economic growth has been slower than claimed the corruption has tainted the very measures that most shape public perception of the economy the monthly consumer price index cpi which serves as the chief bellwether of inflation the quarterly gross domestic product gdp which tracks the u s economys overall growth the monthly unemployment figure which for the general public is perhaps the most vivid indicator of economic health or infirmity the truth though it would not exactly set americans free would at least open a window to wider economic and political understanding readers should ask themselves how much angrier the electorate might be if the media over the past five years had been citing 8 percent unemployment instead of 5 percent 5 percent inflation instead of 2 percent and average annual growth in the 1 percent range instead of the 3 4 percent range the real numbers to most economically minded americans would be a face full of cold water based on the criteria in place a quarter century ago todays u s unemployment rate is somewhere between 9 percent and 12 percent the inflation rate is as high as 7 or even 10 percent economic growth since the recession of 2001 has been mediocre despite a huge surge in the wealth and incomes of the superrich and we are falling back into recession
790931 it is impossible to predict when the magic moment will be reached and everyone finally realizes that the prices being paid for these companies and the debt taken on to support the acquisitions are unsustainable when that happens it wont be pretty across the board stock prices and company valuations will fall banks will announce painful write offs some hedge funds will close their doors and private equity funds will report disappointing returns some companies will be forced into bankruptcy or restructuring
790932 falling stock prices will cause companies to reduce their hiring and capital spending while governments will be forced to raise taxes or reduce services as revenue from capital gains taxes declines and the combination of reduced wealth and higher interest rates will finally cause consumers to pull back on their debt financed consumption it happened after the junk bond and savings and loan collapses of the late 1980s it happened after the tech and telecom bust of the late 90s and it will happen this time
790933 as the price of money increases borrowing and the economy might weaken the deep slump in housing could worsen we could also discover that the long period of cheap credit has left a nasty residue

790965 this text is a galaxy of signifiers not a structure of signifieds it has no beginning it is reversible we gain access to it by several entrances none of which can be authoritatively declared to be the main one the codes it mobilizes extend as far as the eye can reach they are indeterminable the systems of meaning can take over this absolutely plural text but their number is never closed based as it is on the infinity of language
790966 he was the solitary and lucid spectator of a multiform instantaneous and almost intolerably precise world to think is to forge differences generalize make abstractions in the teeming world of funes there were only details almost immediate in their presence
790967 the universe is not subject to our will essentially it follows its own autopoietic operations what humans perceive as harmonious mathematically precise and quantifiably ordered is our own interpretation and an exception to the normal state
790968 if you see things differently that is a matter of indifference for merz but merz and only merz is capable of sometime in a yet unforeseeable future transforming the whole world into a massive work of art what is important in the work of art is only that all parts relate to each other and are given a value in relation to each other and even unknown quantities can be given a value the great secret of merz consists in the giving of a value to unknown quantities thus merz controls that over which one can have no control and thus merz is larger than merz
790969 content and form are in a state of dynamic interaction the understanding of whether an experience is a linear sequence or a constellation raying out from and into a central focus or axis for instance is discoverable only in the work not before it
790970 poetry is a form cut in time as sculpture is a form cut in space
790971 in a sense we inhabit the spaces between things we subsist in emptiness a beautiful liberating thought and nothing to be afraid of the notion of a tethered soul is crude by comparison
790972 how is moving the discussion from the tethered soul concept to vague abstractions like
790973 look look at boxes there is ten ten boxes i count them easy neat like i like not like mess inside them
790974 a box put simply is an approximation a low resolution representation of its ultimate contents
790975 never does more than imitate the book and the book itself is only a tissue of signs an imitation that is lost infinitely deferred
790976 what if mathematics is an entirely human creation only we dont realise it
790977 who discuss the current challenges and creative solutions presented by emerging technologies

790979 but those in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty they also knew its practical value for gold in these dim rooms must have served the function of a reflector
790980 organic art is a method of apperception i e of recognizing what we perceive and is based on an intuition of an order a form beyond forms in which forms partake and of which mans creative works are analogies resemblances natural allegories such art is exploratory
790981 human works of pure art were thought of as instruments through which man might behold an admire some aspect of the cosmic beauty they were said to focus together features of the cosmos too vast and elusive for man otherwise to apprehend their form
790982 art must cut all illusion even that of nature sign must be partially arbitrary without which we fall back into an art of expression into an art of essentialist illusion

790990 i have been in the pharmaceutical industry for 12 years
790991 it is in the patients interest that doctors interact with the pharmaceutical industry this interaction will be for research education post marketing surveillance and detailing of products doctors know interaction especially detailing is aimed at encouraging a doctor to use a particular product and would not continue unless the industry behind it believed it had an impact it is wrong to assume this is always detrimental to our patients or the community doctors unlike other health groups e g pharmacists and other industry groups and other professionals and trades people get no personal benefit or advantage from prescribing one medication over another there is no commission contact with all the competing producers of a class of medications for the same condition ensures doctors are not beholden to any one provider and that they are well informed to best advise according to a particular patients needs all medications on sale in australia are approved as safe and effective by the tga all medication available on the pbs has been shown to be cost effective and medicines australia has audit capabilities to ensure approved prescribing research has shown that in the vast majority of prescriptions doctors allow the pharmacist to determine the drug brand it is likely that the cost of marketing does increase the cost of medications but the industry has so far refused to declare the separate costs of research development education and marketing in a transparent way so this impact is difficult to assess from the individual patient perspective the risk of no relationship between their doctor and the pharmaceutical industry is that their doctor will only have access to medication information from government which may have its own bias journals some can take up to four and a half years to publish an article and internet all these sources can lag behind industry information there is also considerable expense and time involved this time in an environment of doctor shortages is from the patient perspective best to be after hours and the cost again from the patient perspective is best born by someone other than the doctor who would need to pass it on to the consumer overall doctors are there to help patients an open and appropriate relationship with the pharmaceutical industry is in the interests of patients
790992 in late 1981 i went to bangladesh to do a medical student elective

790997 oh man hate to say it but you missed a big one yesterday at new suffolk winds well into the 20s cloudless skies warm water air the only part that didnt line up was the tide since it was outgoing for most of the afternoon jon ford had sent jimi sobeck adam and some other young guns to mattituck yacht club but the wolf sniffed out higher winds further east at new suffolk bill barber was the other sailor in attendance he was driving behind me on new suffolk ave and said i hit the gas when i got to that house with the windmill where you can see all the whitecaps on the bay no doubt i started with 5 9 and jp 93 bill on 5 8 and wolf 5 2 but we were mostly fully to waay over powered so i rigged down to 5 2 and was fully juiced for speed runs and the occasional jump the other guys stayed with their setup but took more breaks and ended up leaving early according to my gps i sailed 51 miles is that even right over 4 5 hours at the very end the tide had finally turned so i got a couple moderately sized jumps but it would have been much better had the tide turned earlier

791025 when its emptier a bar smells like stale beer spilled alcohol frat house
791026 the bar is a three times more intense smell than the mccormick place mens room or 15 times more or 16 times more intense odor than a coffee shop and was almost twice as smelly as an animal shelter
791027 you could think of the smoke being background noise and the music playing and you turn it off and all of the sudden other noises in the bar would pop up
791028 fry vat if its a tavern place hamburgers if theres a grill and youre getting exposed to all these other things body odor perspirants and deodorants and body sprays like axe and smelly clothes
791029 if youre in a club dancing and sweating up a storm and if youre there long enough your clothes will smell a bit
791030 you could place an aroma at a bar that people like they will perceive the environment to be more friendly be happy at the bar and meet more people at the bar

791035 inevitably we will leave our bodies entirely behind and evolve into radically different entities picture a vast shell like form surrounding the sun and absorbing all its energy this is called a dyson sphere after freeman dyson the physicist who conceived of it now imagine a bunch of nested dyson spheres that divert all that solar energy into information processing borrowing the term for russian dolls mr bradbury calls this a matrioshka brain

791062 the quarterbacks dont have the option to throw it deep middle or check its not a judgment of what they want to do its a reaction of what the defense has taken away thats how we do it

791074 we finally have a mouse model we can use to study postpartum depression which has been a major limitation in the field until this point
791075 its very exciting but at the same time we all try to be cautious about being overexcited because there is so much that is unknown
791076 our rapidly modernizing lifestyle is heaping an extra financial burden on the people and at the same time the number of job opportunities is shrinking leading to a general rise in depression
791077 obamas low poll numbers it really isnt hard to figure out why

791079 i think the sheen from earlier this year where he was seen as a streaking meteor and he was the candidate of hope

791117 the only thing you are allowed to say is in support of me
791118 and a very strong personality and a subservient one that probably wont work
791119 yeah my dad is incredibly dominant my mom very quiet my dad ruled the roost growing up
791120 the man should be the head of the household the caretaker and provider
791121 it might be a south american male thing but i think thats the way it should be each party has a role
791122 no dont you want to be taken care of kind of
791123 get rid of him then its the way you operate but i think youll regret it if you call it off now
791124 oh yes i believe in 50 50 sure thing babe
791125 look theres a dude who holds all of the a panel of disapproving gays
791126 with it we could not afford to hold off any security work for post that release
791127 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
791128 you could think of ron wayne kind of like the fifth beatle
791129 he had a strong association with steve jobs and steve wozniak in the beginning but was not a participant in their future success
791130 we are very happy to be able to share his story he represents a bit of history that very few people witnessed and most never knew
791131 the addition of ron wayne to the film was simple
791132 the film lives in high definition as a finalcut pro project his interview was a natural addition
791133 we are still on course for a fall delivery of the dvd which will be so much more than just the movie the hardest thing has been deciding what not to include
791134 there are so many great stories from the people that are part of apples history we are really excited to share this with everyone
791135 we have a more special presentations in the works for the fall that will allow more people to get the opportunity see it on the big screen
791136 i thought we should stay out but he had a premonition that we wouldnt get rained out
791137 im glad he did because i thought we were done for the day
791138 bob and i were really arguing during the red flag
791139 we thought we made the wrong call its amazing that it worked out i feel really good to be back in victory lane
791140 ford works really hard at fuel mileage and everybody here at roush yates works really hard on it im really proud to be here in victory lane a win here at pocono is very special
791141 he knows what the situation is and he got us where we needed to be today
791142 we pitted a lap later than the leaders did all in all it was a great day we did a great job on the track and well move on to the next one
791143 we had a good car we just got mired in traffic at the beginning of the race
791144 they made a good pit call there at the end we had a good car with good speed and when you have that you can afford to make some pit strategy calls
791145 be careful what youre singing especially in another language because it just might let you in on what youre scared to know youre going through in translation
791146 umm what is it that theyre saying thats appealing to me so much

791148 sonaf orchripes sake i dont believe this here are you for sheepish oh inserted here

791155 look ive told you i do not appreciate you calling me a jerk i aint done nothing to you to be called that
791156 kinda well no it was like go down here and do something for somebody or stay up there and keep doing nothing for nobody i came

791159 dude i know but the fact that you know too and you now know enough to point it out to them to not go off and be ready to fight like you used to means this place is working some stuff out for you you refusing to fight has you being the adult in ish that you used to be the child in thats really cool dont cut off your hair you need something to be mellowing you out lol
791160 nah they dont appreciate nothing i do i work hard
791161 i know you do but even with me if this thing has taught me nothing else its that i cant look for anybody else to appreciate what im doing when i get in front of the mirror after 8 hours of this i am the one whos got to appreciate what i did and why its not even about them they are gonna act how they are going to act these people we are helping too forget them you know how hard you work and you know why people twice as old as you still aint figured that one out yet so new orleans has been evenbetter than good for you

791164 yeah i aint wearing the tiara tho lol but that was cool
791165 in the military the essence of leadership is taking care of your people which of the two parties do you think understands taking care of the people its fairly obvious
791166 i didnt serve in the navy nobody serves in the military because we want to protect millionaires we serve in the military because we believe in what america stands for and we understand our personal duty to protect the american people
791167 usually scientific development in nations does not show such a strong acceleration as we have seen in china so it will be interesting to see how it responds and develops in the future
791168 will give you added security and a much bigger chance of recovering your lost phone
791169 being recognized in ms martins book is a strong indication of the importance of correct proper nutrition
791170 our company is founded on the principles of education about proper pet nutrition i developed mulligan stew with a simple yet effective ingredient panel for improving the health and well being of our best friends it is my hope the pet food industry soon begins a long and healthy modification of its standards in pet nutrition i believe ms martins book is a solid foundation towards this change
791171 the profession and the rest of us are better off if sources know that they run the risk of being unmasked if their mendacity is egregious enough to become newsworthy in its own right
791172 id say that part of ross re reporting ought to include a full explanation of exactly who was peddling the bentonite lie in the first place and why they were doing it
791173 in practice most journalists refuse to identify their sources under any circumstances at all even when its clear that those sources deliberately lied to them
791174 that details of the interception first published in a newsweek cover story were leaked by none other than colonel north himself
791175 the whole game of reporters and their confidential sources has gone so far in washington that too many of us have forgotten our first obligation its not to the oliver norths of the world and the reporters protecting them its to readers and viewers and yes to the truth
791176 many other reporters were mad at me but some commentators rightly pointed out that some values the obligation of reporters to their readers superseded the reporter source relationship and that if you used that relationship as a cover for lying you broke the implicit contract
791177 in this instance where the source publicly accuses someone else of leaking a story for devious purposes its incumbent upon you to set the record straight
791178 if a shield law is put in place irresponsible journalists can print anything and get away with destroying lives
791179 on the night of the sept 11 attacks did the white house medical office dispense cipro to staff accompanying vice president dick cheney as he was secreted off to the safety of camp david
791180 convinced that he had been subjected to a lethal dose of anthrax
791181 actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
791182 there is some indication and i dont have the conclusions but some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
791183 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
791184 w hat we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted six years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
791185 that there was a network of people who were promoting a theory about anthrax that helped make the case for war
791186 join s those who believe that some kind of congressional investigation is in order
791187 no tell me they didnt just do that tell me it was a swerve it was and when i found out it was that was the moment i fell in love with the movie completely
791188 what you thought you knew was true is really a lie
791189 i am grateful for the opportunity to have served in such a wonderfully progressive school system where student achievement and individual attention is so much the focus of the schools efforts
791190 and now its time for me to pursue some other interests
791191 i want to thank dr manaseri for his service to the brighton central school district he has done a fine job in moving our district forward and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors
791192 the board is grateful that valenti has agreed to postpone his retirement until june 2009 valenti has been employed by the district for 20 years and has been responsible for the districts fiscal integrity and stability
791193 not a serious tournament but a day of fun at a fine golf course
791194 we beat them both times but the scores were 2 1 and 9 8
791195 many of his students went on to great music schools like the berklee school of music or eastman and came to a real level of expertise
791196 this first music festival is really an effort to begin an annual event to celebrate local music and bring people together in a festival type of atmosphere
791197 we got word out to people who knew dennis and really cared about what he was doing we had many more people who wanted to play than could fit we wanted to give everybody a full 45 minute set
791198 i studied fiddle and philosophy with him but he was also a very dear friend
791199 we spent many hours talking and playing more talking than playing some times and the occasional jack daniels manhattan at the brighton
791200 we do the festival to keep him in our hearts to support the programs that the benefits pay for and to stay close to his wife and family so they can also have our support
791201 when a member of the music community passes away we never really lose them as long as we continue to play music together in their honor and memory playing these benefits gives us the opportunity to share stories and keep the good work going it reminds us of all that we share
791202 students have to lock their doors and keep their possessions safe you have a lot of students at college that just havent learned to do that at home
791203 there are a lot of people in a small space somebody could wander into a room and wander out with someone elses things
791204 there are new types of crimes and new ways to prevent becoming a victim so if you visit every now and then youll probably stay on top of it all
791205 if you go down jefferson road in henrietta and look at the parking lots there they are largely empty
791206 ive never seen those lots full i think vast parking lots are outdated
791207 this is the sort of place that is not just a place to shop there will be ice skating there in the winter restaurants and an embassy suites hotel
791208 there isnt anything like it in brighton at lunch time you cant find a place to eat there is no place to gather in monroe county if you want to go out on a saturday or sunday evening and want to eat outside its park avenue schoen place or along the canal in fairport
791209 its enormous and its as far from the current zoning as you could possibly get
791210 there is no respect at all for the master plan or comprehensive plan
791211 weve spent a lot of money on traffic studies as did the town and the state
791212 we wouldnt go into anything if we thought we were going to cause a traffic problem its my reputation on the line im very proud of my developments in the town of brighton ive been building there for 25 years
791213 managing the emotions of caregiving for both the care giver and the care recipient
791214 the moment i ran into the brazilian defender i knew my leg was broken my knee was pointed up and my foot was pointing a different direction i accepted at that moment that my olympic dreams werent going to be what i originally had planned
791215 when they the announcers finally said what happened to her i just started crying because i was really looking forward to her being in the olympics
791216 i know im a very important player on the team
791217 but in that moment it made me realize how insignificant one player is in a team environment
791218 i know she will do anything in her power to get back shell find inspiration from somewhere probably within herself
791219 theres no question of whether or not ill come back from this
791220 its more when ill come back will it take a lot of hard work and dedication pain and suffering probably
791221 will give you added security and a much bigger chance of recovering your lost phone
791222 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
791223 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
791224 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
791225 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
791226 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys
791227 i was kind of sweating it but im glad it went in
791228 i had a putt for what i thought would get me into a playoff
791229 i hit the best putt i could have hit without it going in
791230 i tried to hit it as close as possible so i didnt leave myself any putts
791231 the fringe ended up being a lot slower the first time i really putted through the fringe all week the putt just seemed like the right shot at the time

791247 i first heard about the coke commercial a few months ago i received an email directly to my inbox i dont even know who gave them my address from an english agency who said they were working for coca cola they were interested in using my song the anthem from the album chinoiseries for the coca cola beijing olympic games tv worldwide commercial i was really excited when i got this mail i thought everything was gonna be simple
791248 there were issues with the sample because i hadnt been able to clear it it is from a chinese song from the early 1970s the label doesnt exist anymore and as i dont read chinese i wasnt able to find the original author when coke knew i couldnt clear the sample they chose to remake the song using a musicologist he rerecorded the guitar the chinese wood drums the violin the flute he even added the crackling vinyl sound but he needed to make a few changes to make it legal so its a little different to the sample i first used
791249 they sent me what the musicologist had done and i worked on it the same way id worked on the original chinese sample so the original version and the second one really sounded alike because i used the same drums and bass on both finally a few days later the agency sent me the advert and my drums were missing coke wanted it softer so the musicologist reworked everything id done nothing i did appears in the music you hear in the commercial
791250 i feel like they are silly rabbits all i have now is a co writer credit i didnt get a big cheque enough to buy the new ibook

791258 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
791259 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
791260 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
791261 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
791262 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
791263 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
791264 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
791265 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
791266 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
791267 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
791268 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
791269 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
791270 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
791271 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
791272 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
791273 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

791306 findbugz analyzes a program without exectuing it generally static analysis tools have no idea what your program is supposed to do instead it looks for violations of reasonable programming practices if this statement is executed an npe will occur not a replacement for testing very good at finding that you have code that is not tested
791307 programmers are smart smart programmers dont make dumb mistakes we have all these good techniques for finding bugs so if there actually are bugs in production code they must be very subtle bugs

791330 well long pause as i tried to figure out how to say this nicely i only read things that hold my interest oops
791331 one year ago an opportunity like this would have been really exciting to me to appear on tv and talk about blogs with a pap minister well that was one year ago and one year in internet time feels like 10 years in the offline world since then the singapore blogosphere has come a long way bloggers are no longer going to burst with surprise delight or alarm just because the mainstream media or the government wants to talk to them
791332 the tv show will probably be a good chance for george yeo to publicise his own blogging attempts on

791336 gayle promised not to blog about some of the things i said
791337 as it stands it is little more than speculative derision
791338 it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand more perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them
791339 employers have reacted with horror to the new australian fair pay commissions afpc first minimum wage decision which delivers up to 27 36 a week for the nations poorest workers
791340 people support cpf cuts because there are no protest outside parliament

791345 i would want to form an alternative policies group in parliament comprising 20 pap mps these 20 pap mps will be free to vote in accordance with what they think of a particular policy in other words the whip for them will be lifted this is not playing politics this is something which i think is worthwhile doing
791346 if you sing jailhouse rock with your electric guitar when others are playing beethoven you are out of order the whip must be used on you
791347 save on one hairdo and use the money for breast screening
791348 we started off with the name and after looking at everything the name that really tugged at the heartstrings was in front of us the name itself is not new but what has been used informally so far has endeared itself to all parties
791349 having enjoyed football as a national sport for decades we in singapore have set ourselves the target of reaching the final rounds of world cup in 2010
791350 only 5 are unemployed we still have 95 who are employed
791351 singaporean workers have become more expensive than those in the usa and australia
791352 people support cpf cuts because there are no protest outside parliament

791356 you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
791357 say as little as possible the more you say the more ammunition you are giving the other party to use against you
791358 their right to say what they want in whatever manner they wish to say it
791359 the use of abusive names to belittle or humiliate another person in a political campaign an argument etc

791366 the board made the decision believed to be in response to complaints about foreign workers living in hdb estates known in a circular sent out to real estate agents on tuesday mr chris koh director of dennis wee properties said the decision to disallow foreign construction workers from living in public estates may have come about because of the disturbance that some of them create mp ho geok choo who looks after the boon lay ward where many foreign workers live disclosed in a recent interview that she gets frequent complaints of the noise foreign workers make when they congregate and the litter they leave behind in parks and gardens
791367 i din know that actually so i did a google and it turn out to be true at least in 2000 the figure i saw was however to illustrate that illegal immigrants are more likely to commit an offence than a legal one because they have less to lose and that didnt make me feel safer
791368 you guys are aware that on average singaporeans commit more crimes than foreign workers right
791369 will you let me go to hell however i choose

791374 garment gif progressive package first then increase to take back what the garment has given to you this is not the first time lar singaporeans no stupid one they just kia si oni no ball to talk the garment just keep quiet
791375 indirect taxes are also interesting because they are regressive they hurt the poor more than they do the rich because both the poor and the rich must pay the same amount of tax for a certain good but that amount will take a larger proportion out of the poor persons income than it will for the rich
791376 and michael quick run to huichieh daddy before whybegay the tormentor come and snatch away your candy

791380 there was no direct evidence that he knew the capsules contained diamorphine there was nothing to suggest that smith had told him they contained diamorphine or that he had found that out on his own
791381 shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose
791382 of course animal has soul but not eternal like man
791383 we have only one law we kill to eat and live
791384 i also agree that it is not wrong to support the death penalty with reasons given earlier i did not recommend that death penalty be taken away totally just that it has to be reviewed and be more carefully executed
791385 my bible knowledge is very little only no offence if i got anything wrong but do remember that in this world sa tan holds a lot of power and he sets many rules and laws for many people many of these are deceptive though well painted and they need to be reviewed
791386 we have only one law we kill to eat and live
791387 ok i know that god made man according to his image and unlike animal man is a living soul
791388 god also allowed the first man and woman to eat anything except that apple there is therefore a difference between animal and man
791389 i may be convinced to a certain extent that for a criminal who killed anyone he should be sentenced to death but not so cruel type lah dont need to be as cruel as that criminal lah lest we are just the same as him but in a case where the so called criminal cannot be 100 pct proven and if it is not one who kill or may kill others i recommend at the worst life sentence my advise be it alive or be it dead dont be so quick to hang his head give a criminal a reasonable period of time to be imprisoned first and hear the word of god he then can have a chance to mend his ways if not join the others like him in hell lah
791390 to presume that a person in possession of more than 15 grams of heroin is trafficking drugs is like presuming a person in possession of a few cases of vodka is addicted to alcohol
791391 i agree that death penalty is still not 100 effective as a deterrent people still continue extreme crimes because they dont fear death if this is so then the more we dont need death penalty in our law
791392 murderers are still more evil than the death penalty absolutely true this is where only god can change the heart of wicked man so why death penalty
791393 it is better to imprison them for life impart them with the word of god and ask god to change their hearts only god can change the heart of man bring justice or take away a persons life he can also set prisoners free
791394 when the officers arrived about 20 minutes later they introduced themselves and brought him back to the reception area of the hotel where they questioned him he told them that he had come from dubai and that he had come to singapore to get trials with football clubs in singapore he admitted that no arrangements had been made with any club and that he intended to approach the football federation for assistance he also told the officers that he did not enter singapore because he was told that he needed to have 2000 to enter and he did not have the money he had expected his father to send him the money but his father did not send it
791395 when the first accused was asked if the capsules were chocolate he confirmed they were
791396 43 on the other hand the first accused did not have a consistent belief in the contents of the capsules when he was first asked if the capsules were chocolate he affirmed that they were and then said that they were herbs which tasted like chocolate and then that they were african herbs for stomach problems when by his own evidence smith had not informed him of the origin of the herbs their taste or use
791397 46 why was the us 2000 an issue it was because the large sum promised should have raised suspicion the first accuseds evidence was that smith was not a rich man he did not have enough money to buy an air ticket for himself to go from dubai to indonesia to visit his sick friend there must be a reason for smith to offer him the large sum of us 2000 to deliver the capsules of herbs when he was already funding his passages to dubai and to singapore the first accused knew that smith was a man who would break the law as smith had arranged for false visas and endorsements to be entered into the first accuseds passport to facilitate his travels he must have realised that smith was offering him much more than was reasonable for putting him through the minor inconvenience of meeting up with marshal at the airport terminal and handing the capsules to him he should have asked to be shown and be assured of the contents before agreeing to deliver them and he could have used the ample opportunities he had when he was in possession of the capsules to check them himself but he did nothing
791398 48 i found that he had wilfully turned a blind eye on the contents of the capsules because he was tempted by the us 2000 which was a large sum to him when smith who had befriended him and had appeared to help him get out of pakistan also offered him the us 2000 he did not want to ask any questions or check the capsules himself consequently even if he may not have actual knowledge that he was carrying diamorphine his ignorance did not exculpate him because it is well established that i gnorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination
791399 laws in place are not created nor taken down based on whether they would be 100 or less effective as deterrent they are put in place as the moral limits of a society to discourage people from committing disapprovable crimes the implementation of the death penalty does not seek a quota or a number it has nothing to do with statistics when does the implementation of any law has if a society has no crimes does it mean it does not require a system of law the law is the democratic voice of a society to deal with immoral criminals who cross the line democracy of a soceity has to be respected otherwise there would be obligarchy if people dont wish to see criminals die from the death penalty they can do at least do something by spreading the preventive measure by educating would be criminals to not commit serious crimes rather than just being the dictators of consequential actions of law or vote for another political party that would not support the death penalty saying anything more is just ineffective and disrespectful towards democracy
791400 the punishment of law is always seen as unfair to the criminals or to the outside observers this is the deterrence of the law
791401 he told them that he had come from dubai and that he had come to singapore to get trials with football clubs in singapore he admitted that no arrangements had been made with any club and that he intended to approach the football federation for assistance
791402 he also told the officers that he did not enter singapore because he was told that he needed to have 2000 to enter and he did not have the money
791403 joseph marshal wrote my telephone number 01 2585312 on the receipt
791404 i disapprove of the death penalty for drug trafficking simply because it is a state of affairs crime
791405 the prosecution told the court that the capsules contained 727 02 grams of diamorphine since the total exceeded 15 grams the prosecution was going to rely on the presumption that tochi was trafficking that is to say they do not have to prove he was trafficking it was for the defence to rebut the presumption
791406 he who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become one
791407 it is a fundamental human right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
791408 the standard accepted by the international community is that capital punishment may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts
791409 singapore cannot reverse the burden and require a defendant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he didnt know that he was carrying drugs
791410 t here was no direct evidence that he knew the capsules contained diamorphine or that he had found that out on his own
791411 in the case of iwuchukwu amara tochi the government of singapore has failed to ensure respect for the relevant legal safeguards under the circumstances the execution should not proceed
791412 singapores decision to make the death penalty mandatory keeps judges from considering all of the factors relevant to determining whether a death sentence would be permissible in a capital case
791413 actually the testimony he gave was that he thought he required 2000 for entry into singapore not for the drugs and he also claimed not to know they were drugs at all
791414 i had to talk long and hard to get my husband to agree to take these photos
791415 he didnt want to have me showing myself to the world i kept on at him for weeks about posing till he finally gave in once we got going he really got into it and was like a porno director telling me how to pose and what to do he had shorts and a t shirt on so i made him cock it got hard right away so i knew i was doing all the right things to look real sexy
791416 we must not be afraid of putting people in the shoes of groups or people or individuals that are not comfortable that we dont like or think we dont like
791417 its very easy to look at any one side in this conflict and say these are the good guys and these are bad guys but if weve learned anything in the 21st century already its that maybe there are no good guys and bad guys anymore
791418 v clav havel great dissident political intellectual he goes into politics and finds that he cant to use his own phrase live in truth
791419 you have to make compromises in what you say you have to censor yourself you have to tell half truths and above all you have to go on endlessly repeating yourself
791420 i think that at different stages in your life it may be possible to be a critical intellectual and to be an engaged politician but you certainly cant do both at the same time
791421 there cannot ever have been a place where more and better use was made of committees and studies and commissions to slow things down its extremely frustrating
791422 but if you choose your spots if you pick your issues and focus like a laser on those issues build coalitions work with ngos non governmental organizations and are persistent you can use the process to make albeit modest progress on some of these issues
791423 the united states has announced that its ready to accept a common asian currency
791424 im pro gay rights and im anti discrimination against gays but i think same sex marriage is one of the things where childrens rights trump gay rights
791425 im prepared to put up with that its really part of my job
791426 ive often thought you know i live not in the country of my birth ive got no children or partner and i dont have any relatives in canada and ive lived here for 30 years and im a great believer in destiny and i sort of think that youd have to be almost designed in the situation im in for someone like me in order to give them the freedom to do what i can do is to take that and let that anger and often hatred come out
791427 the reasons for the high vulnerability of gay men to hiv have included higher than average rates of promiscuity and non practice of safe sex
791428 yet new infections continue stopping hiv transmission is not a static problem but an unending battle and one we might lose
791429 the hope should be that young men and women mostly in their teens who struggle with sexual orientation will understand that being gay is acceptable and that marriage will foster a culture of monogamy and or stable long lasting relationships among gay men that will reverse the trends of recent decades
791430 to increased monogamy and diminished rates of sexually transmitted disease values that conservatives have long claimed as their own
791431 the people have suffered years of warfare only the king of qin can stop the chaos by uniting all under heaven
791432 he asked me to abandon the assassination for the greater good of all he said one persons suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of many the rivalry of the kingdoms of zhao and qin is trivial compared to the greater cause
791433 was a time of endless brutal wars and much hardship and suffering the king of qin qinshihuang was most ruthless and ambitious of all historically chronicled as a brutal tyrant the qinshihuang was determined to conquer and control all of the states
791434 political power generally conceived as the power of constraint and command was seen in china as the principle that gave life and order even if this conception did not exclude recourse to force and brutal interventions
791435 but constraint is always accompanied in china by the idea of moral correction it would be a mistake to see in the insistence laid on the regulation of morals only a pretext a sort of alibi for a tyrannical regime it is in fact the expression of a privileged mode of political action which has lasted down to our day thus we should only be deceiving ourselves if we thought that we had torn away the mask from a power that was simply autocratic
791436 this remark leads us on to the dangerous ground of the general characteristics of chinese thought china does not know the transcendent truths the idea of good in itself the notion of property in the strict sense of the term she sic does not like the exclusion of opposition the idea of the absolute the positive distinction between mind and matter she prefers the notions of complementarity of circulation influx of action at a distance of a model and the idea of order as an organic totality for chinese thought the order of beings and of the world is best translated by systems of variable dynamic symbols her logic does not proceed from an analysis of language it is based on the handling of signs with opposing and complementary values perhaps chinese writing is not unconnected with these deep rooted tendencies which have ended by giving a privileged position to the written sign at the expense of the spoken word
791437 there are close links between writing and civilization without this means of recording and transmitting facts and ideas which gives man a hold over space and time the great civilizations would not have been able to develop but the sort of writing used has had profound effects on the general orientation of these civilizations chinese writing enables us better than any other to appreciate this very important fact it provides the only example of writing totally original in its principle every sign corresponds as a rule to a semantic unit and consequently extremely complex which has nevertheless served as means of expression to such a large part of humanity
791438 after the unification of the script imposed by the chin in the chinese lands at the end of the 3rd century b c this writing became one of the most effective instruments of political unification chinese writing became a sort of universal means of expression in every part of asia subject to chinese civilization or influence written chinese remained the cultural and administrative language of vietnam until the french conquest and that of korea down to the japanese annexation just as it had been a part of japan during the centuries when the influence of china was preponderant in that country thus there exists a whole literature in chinese whose creators poets historians novelists philologians and philosophers were not chinese at all but korean japanese and vietnamese it is consequently legitimate to say that in east asia there was a real community of civilization characterized by use of the chinese script
791439 hiya where are you oh well can you come back to the coach now why not well its just that its time to leave ok see you soon
791440 the information on the internet may not always be just the unreliable opinionated bloggers i think that increasingly people might be turning to more mainstream or established websites like the personally i almost never watch television any more because it is so slow to sit through a newscast when i can go to the ctv website and find all the stories on the line up and just scan them within a few minutes
791441 senators let big media off hook committees long awaited report shrugs at canwest targets cbc
791442 the caj is calling upon all federal political parties to endorse five basic principles and to ensure that these principles are enshrined in the federal access to information act
791443 in particular the caj urges the harper government which was elected on a platform of openness and accountability to finally respond positively to years of reports and recommendations regarding improvements to the act
791444 no previous government has put forward a more retrograde and dangerous set of proposals to change the act the new government has done exactly the things for which its predecessor had been ridiculed
791445 what do we do with the michigan and florida delegates
791446 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
791447 allah curse those person who perform the act of people of lout
791448 narrated by muhammad ibn ishaq from amru bin abi amru 6 there has been a debate between jurists as to whether the act of liwat constitutes zina or not there are different of opinion regarding this matter 7 a group of jurists held the opinion that liwat amounts to zina while some differs to opine that liwat does not constitute zina the latter is the opinion by majority of jurists the jurists in the first group who said that liwat amounts to zina based their argument on one hadith from abu musa where the prophet said when a man came to another man and had a carnal relation both of them are adulterer they also supported their view with the synonymous nature and characteristic in both act liwat and zina these jurists said liwat shares similar characteristics of zina physically and in term of its objective 9 physically there is a carnal intercourse involved in both acts objectively the main aim of liwat and on the other hand jurists which consist of the majority in the second group who opined that liwat does not constitute zina argued that custom and norms of the society does not treat liwat as zina they said that if a person makes an oath or promise that he will not commit the offence of zina but later involves in liwat he would not be regarded as having breach his oath or promise 10 the jurists who favour this view opined that the former hadith used by the jurists in the first group to support their opinion that liwat amount to zina does not meant to equalize liwat with the offence of zina technically they said such hadith tries to suggest that liwat is a sinful and condemned act just like zina 11 this is because in another hadith the prophet said if a woman came to another woman and had an intimate relation they are adulteresses
791449 a man came to the prophet who was in the mosque and said i have committed zina but i regretted it so much this statement was repeated for four times the prophet then asked the man are you insane the man answered no then the prophet further asked the man are you a muhsan
791450 those whom you found perfoming the act of people of lout kill them both the active and the passive partner
791451 the upper and the lower partner should be stoned to death
791452 a man shall not look into the aurah of another man and a woman shall not look into the laurah of another woman nor can two men be in one b blanket and nor can two women be in the one blanket as well
791453 if woman came to another women had an intimate relation they are adulteresses
791454 why did they not produce four witnesses since they have not produced witnesses then with allah they are the liars
791455 and do not backbite one another does one of you like that he eats the flesh of his dead brother
791456 we will not bow our heads before taliban terrorists rather we will face them the conspiracy of talibanisation is on the rise in karachi and mqm activists should remain mentally and physically prepared to face hard times ahead
791457 terrorists strangle innocent men and women old and young and burn down female educational institutions in the name of islam this is ignorance the holy prophet pbuh said that it is obligatory for every man and woman to get education
791458 the people here in pakistan were muslims and are muslims what kind of muslims do they the taliban want to make us actually they the taliban want to bring the shariah of the kalashnikov into force but people will not tolerate such a forced shariah
791459 it happens sometimes with these kind not wanting to return to the manufacturer
791460 radiated i have to be radiated i didnt sign up for this i didnt agree to be radiated no no

791462 you wont even notice the e beam only takes about 10 seconds
791463 i heard that you could get a bit bleached from electron beams
791464 i dont mean to spread rumors but i heard about this february playboy issue that had her ends bleached and

791469 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
791470 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
791471 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
791472 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
791473 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
791474 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
791475 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
791476 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
791477 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
791478 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
791479 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
791480 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
791481 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
791482 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
791483 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
791484 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
791485 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
791486 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
791487 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
791488 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
791489 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
791490 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
791491 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
791492 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
791493 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
791494 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
791495 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
791496 arrest is an instantaneous shattering thrust expulsion somersault from one state into another
791497 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
791498 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
791499 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others

791734 we just scored a few more runs than we did in the other games
791735 we pitched a little bit better down the stretch that was about it two bad games are going to happen over the course of a season more than once you just try to take a win when you can and not let them snowball and i think we did that
791736 its not limiting the damage when i need to the situation like tonight i have something set up where if i make some big pitches i can get out of it im not executing when i need to
791737 i dont throw as much and do things like that

791760 now a few of the stories burning up the tube so to speak news youre more likely to find forwarded to you by email than in any newspaper call it viral news first if you think youtube is all silliness and fluff check this out a new york city police officer was videotaped ramming a bicyclist to the ground the officer was later identified hes now been stripped of his badge and gun and is on desk duty while the department investigates
791761 the cyclist in this video was arrested held for 26 hours and charged with attempted assault and resisting arrest
791762 mccain says obama is all star power and no substance obama says mccain is using scare tactics its getting nasty and its only july
791763 obama told an audience in missouri the republicans are just trying to scare voters
791764 its getting ugly early and some republicans are expressing concern about mccains

791767 pot had helped and booze maybe a little blow when you could afford it
791768 why obama chose to disclose he smoked marijuana and used cocaine at all remains a mystery
791769 perhaps obama felt the information would eventually come forward from his school buddies so to minimize the damage from this concealed fact obama possibly judged self disclosure was the best route

791782 it is absolutely outrageous that the special supplemental nutrition program that wic sponsors would refer mothers to the nations largest abortion chain for health care
791783 planned parenthood kills more children than any other single organization in the country how can a program for children associate with it
791784 the american taxpayer is simply fed up with planned parenthood feeding at the trough of government largesse
791785 it is time we ended all association between government organizations and planned parenthood a billion dollar giant in the sex industry
791786 i thank the gentleman for yielding and thank him for his strong moral leadership on this issue i want to commend the ranking member and the chairman of the foreign affairs committee for having the moral courage to bring this resolution to the house before congress adjourns
791787 it is important that we speak truth to power and with the 2008 olympics in beijing about to begin it is important that the people of the united states be heard on our ideals as athletes from around the world and global media descend on china
791788 it is important that we say as the late tom lantos chairman of the foreign affairs committee said in a hearing last year a few months before his death china is a police state
791789 i personally believe that the selection of china as the site of the 2008 olympic games was a historic error
791790 while there is much talk in the media today about the cloud of smog hanging over beijing as these games approach let me say from my heart the real cloud over the beijing olympics is the horror of forced abortion
791791 and make no mistake about it chinas policy requires that unpermitted babies be aborted article 25 of the henan province population and family planning regulations reads under any of the following conditions necessary remedial measures shall be taken and pregnancy
791792 in the committee we heard the most horrific stories of these so called family planning technical service workers literally breaking into homes dragging women in the ninth month of pregnancy off to clinics forcing abortions on them and in one case after another going to horrific means to ensure that the newly born childs life had been completely snuffed out
791793 there is not time in this debate to recount those instances but they are legion in china and they result in the heartbreak of tens of millions of that country of good and decent people
791794 very clearly the insurgency is in no position to overthrow the government or really even to challenge it

791798 so senator obama and his campaign decided that it would be inappropriate to visit wounded soldiers in germany while touring europe as a candidate for the presidency senator mccain hit this one right on the head it is never inappropriate to visit our wounded men and women in uniform
791799 when obama learned that he couldnt bring his media circus he blew off visiting wounded us troops in germany but iraqs minister of the interior jawad karim al bolani holds them in higher regard visiting them at walter reed and offering them the thanks for ending saddam husseins menacing and genocidal rule that have not been forthcoming from the democrats who helped send them to war
791800 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic in iraq was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
791801 why cant obama bring himself to acknowledge the surge worked better than he and other skeptics including this page thought it would what does that stubbornness say about the kind of president hed be
791802 weve got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that were not just air raiding villages and killing civilians which is causing enormous pressure over there
791803 you know ive heard from an army captain who was the head of a rifle platoon supposed to have 39 men in a rifle platoon ended up being sent to afghanistan with 24 because 15 of those soldiers had been sent to iraq and as a consequence they didnt have enough ammunition they didnt have enough humvees they were actually capturing taliban weapons because it was easier to get taliban weapons than it was for them to get properly equipped by our current commander in chief
791804 if you talk to commanders on the ground there theyll tell you instead of having another platoon id rather have a couple of agricultural specialists

791843 i am a musician with fibromyalgia and fibromyalgia research is one of the most important things i can think of to use the gift of music for
791844 however these are my renditions of these songs and they are different from the originals by a significant degree the rest are songs i have written and these will be available for fibromyalgia research funding soon on cd or by download
791845 after only one lesson she can pick out the melody of all my songs i am 52 so we have a broad age range 107 years and we are all related
791846 the youngsters are thrilled to be helping me with my fibromyalgia and the research it gives me a big kick to watch their enthusiasm and their support they are great kids and i love them to bits for helping me their grandmother and their mother who has fms are pretty proud of them too
791847 my fibro first began to be a major problem when i was about 24 so i have had fibromyalgia most of my life i was an electronics engineer and finally in my 30s had to give up my career i had just bought a home to raise my family and had a new mortgage and i suddenly could not work anymore
791848 somehow with my wifes support we managed to survive staying together and being close as a family is very important when you have fibromyalgia my oldest daughter also has fibromyalgia and her son justin is part of the band
791849 the music we play is a bit of everything some is blues and jazz and folk and some good old rock n roll i write songs about real life what i have lived and learned
791850 one song that is about my experience with fibro is called
791851 i truly believe that research into fibromyalgia is at a stage where new discoveries are within our grasp sadly with the economic troubles we are all facing today research funding is not keeping pace with the science we badly need to develop
791852 we originally planned a benefit concert at hill auditorium for sept 21 of this year but with the economy the way it is corporate sponsors are a bit more difficult to find so the date will most likely be moved back unless we get a miracle in my world miracles happen often
791853 we will soon be producing a cd which will further help raise funds for research and will have a dozen or so songs on itunes soon that will also benefit research

791885 june 1986 i was 9 years old at the time and had just received my introduction to the van halen juggernaut via the 5150 album needless to say it was quite the eye opening experience especially from a musicians point of view i had just started playing drums at this time as well to this day if i am asked who my number one influence is regarding drumming i say eddie van halen yes i know how to play guitar and yes at one point i did own a wolfgang eds signature line of guitars from when he was affiliated with peavey but theres no way i can play half as good not even a quarter as good as ed and since i cannot play anywhere near eds level drunk or sober i decided to take the next best approach paint a computer case like his famous frankenstrat guitar
791886 van halen had loads of cash to get the guitars he wanted anytime he wanted so my question to you is how much money have you spent so far on this project
791887 i dont have an exact figure but im pretty sure that it is under 100 usd i got the case for free bought some plexiglass leds a grab bag from paulie last year and a few other odds and ends now if you figure in the equipment that ive bought over the last year the jigsaw the scrollsaw the belt sander et al then the price jumps to well over 300 usd but since hardware such as this will be used not only for other mods but for other endeavors as well i dont see the need to incorporate these expenses into the build expenses
791888 of course this is a modding website its pretty much required that i ask this next question what did this box used to be before you started this project
791889 all in all swiftech has made an awesome kit with this one they really out did themselves even on 5 volts though the fans can be a little noisy i hope to be replacing them with some quieter ones also be careful about what screws you use to mount the fans there are 3 types and they are all almost the same size 1 will be slightly short and the other will puncture the rad which i almost did

792005 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch the leadership of both parties must step up to condemn such hateful speech and demand apologies the obama campaign has criticized the lyrics but we call on the presumptive party nominee who is the celebrated subject of the new song to go even further publicly condemn the song demand an apology on behalf of the targets now
792006 this is about beginning the grinding and painful process of rooting out this kind of hate language and behavior whenever and wherever it exists the democratic leadership have pledged to unhinge our nation from gender bias hate language and misogyny and we are taking them at their word

792030 racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
792031 but felipe was running longer to the final pit stops
792032 i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship
792033 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me
792034 halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
792035 he scored his first grand prix victory in fine style and converting his excellent qualifying pace which has been apparent all season into a thoroughly well deserved win as bad days go it could have been a lot worse for lewis but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him
792036 i am sorry for felipe and for the team as it is horrible to lose a race in this way it was tough for me because when you spend a long time behind a slower car it becomes frustrating and boring
792037 when i was finally able to push the car was behaving very well but by then it was too late i came up behind glock but in the end i had to slow as i had a mechanical problem with the rear end and the team told me to be very careful to ensure i brought the car home its true that im the one who has won the most points out of the top three in the classification which shows this championship is really unpredictable with ups and downs for everyone but it was a disappointing weekend for me we must try and fix the problems we have in qualifying to start at the front so as to exploit the potential of the car if we can do that then we can get back to fighting for the win
792038 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 to get such a good result in my first year is fantastic so a huge thank you to all the team including the engineers mechanics and everyone at the factory i knew from qualifying that we had good speed and weve looked strong all weekend today i made a good start and gained a place into the first corner i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes
792039 this is a very good result for us and to pick up 10 points is great for the constructors championship i was quick today but i couldnt push because i only had one lap that was clear of traffic in the whole afternoon i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form
792040 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well
792041 that is encouraging for the rest of the championship we scored some important points which is satisfying todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
792042 i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
792043 we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track one point is better than nothing
792044 i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap
792045 but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me
792046 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here
792047 unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn one and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
792048 we think ours was caused by the heat building up back pressure in the fuel tank
792049 we dont think our problem was specific to the heat here

792117 it should be noted that at no time during any of the above interviews did the defendant show any obvious emotion as to the loss of her child
792118 we cant compel casey anthony to give us more information
792119 she has the right to not talk to about it but certainly as the mother i would hope she would be willing to give us whatever information she had to help us find her child
792120 you left your 2 year old child with a person who does not exist at an apartment you cannot identify and you lied to your parents about your childs whereabouts
792121 at this point there is no indication that caylee is deceased
792122 we dont know where she is our concern is for the child and to locate her
792123 if we had been called the day she disappeared it would have been much easier to find the child
792124 time is the enemy in these cases however the greatest challenge faced by law enforcement is the delay in starting the investigation
792125 i had no reason to believe they werent where they were supposed to be
792126 as i received information and relayed it to the defendant after her arrest she continued to claim ignorance and at times laughed about the situation
792127 she failed to show any outward signs of remorse or concern for her missing two year old daughter
792128 as inappropriate for minors in an attempt to make the video just a little more difficult for people to see seems like obamas idea for
792129 the twentieth century has not been kind to the constant human striving for a sense of purpose in life two world wars the holocaust the invention of nuclear weapons and now the global environmental crises have led many of us to wonder if survival much less enlightened joyous and hopeful living is possible we retreat into the seductive tools and technologies of industrial civilization but that only creates new problems as we become increasingly isolated from one another and disconnected from our roots
792130 again we must not forget the lessons of world war ii the resistance slowed the advance of fascism and scored important victories but fascism continued its relentless march to domination until the rest of the world finally awoke and made the difference and made the defeat of fascism its central organizing principle from 1941 through 1945
792131 it is not necessary for the sake of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any new kind of social order nature takes care of itself it was a spontaneous creation that existed long before any human society and for countless centuries many different kinds of human societies coexisted with nature without doing it an excessive amount of damage only with the industrial revolution did the effect of human society on nature become really devastating
792132 modern industrial civilization as presently organized is colliding violently with our planets ecological system the ferocity of its assault on the earth is breathtaking and the horrific consequences are occurring so quickly as to defy our capacity to recognize them comprehend their global implications and organize an appropriate and timely response isolated pockets of resistance fighters who have experienced this juggernaut at first hand have begun to fight back in inspiring but in the final analysis woefully inadequate ways
792133 among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population isolation of man from nature excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small scale communities such as the extended family the village or the tribe
792134 all pre industrial societies were predominantly rural the industrial revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before
792135 the positive ideal that is proposed is nature that is wild nature those aspects of the functioning of the earth and its living things that are independent of human management and free of human interference and control
792136 any child born into the hugely consumptionist way of life so common in the industrial world will have an impact that is on average many times more destructive than that of a child born in the developing world
792137 and tragically since the onset of the scientific and technological revolution it has become all too easy for ultrarational minds to create an elaborate edifice of clockwork efficiency capable of nightmarish cruelty on an industrial scale the atrocities of hitler and stalin and the mechanical sins of all who helped them might have been inconceivable except for the separation of facts from values and knowledge from morality
792138 the modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things against which he is helpless nuclear accidents carcinogens in food environmental pollution war increasing taxes invasion of his privacy by large organizations and nationwide social or economic phenomena that may disrupt his way of life
792139 industrial society seems likely to be entering a period of severe stress due in part to problems of human behavior and in part to economic and environmental problems

792150 majoritatea firmelor care au raspuns la chestionar 79 5 ar alege si astazi romania ca amplasament investitional ceea ce inseamna ca angajamentul lor in romania este un succes domeniile in care firmele vad cea mai mare necesitate de a actiona pe plan economic si politic ar fi administratia publica infrastructura sistemul fiscal coruptia si siguranta juridica
792151 cum as fi putut sa dau munca si profitul meu de 17 ani plus un credit la banca de 4 milioane de euro pe 2 milioane de dolari e absurd
792152 am organizat o licitatie care nu a fost publica unde au participat mari firme in domeniu precum upc airbites si rcs amp rds si am acceptat pretul oferit de upc cit despre televiziune pot spune ca mai degraba am facut o cadou iesenilor
792153 in 1986 m am mutat impreuna cu familia mea de la casa la bloc si atunci am facut primul sistem de receptie a patru programe cu un grup de antene si transmisiuni electronice la toti locuitorii acelui bloc dupa acel sistem locatarii de la celelalte blocuri mi au cerut sa le fac si lor atunci am renuntat la postul meu de sef de proiectoare la interprinderea de traductoare si regulatoare directe itrd pascani dupa 6 ani de munca si trei brevete de inventie am plecat la cooperatie mi am facut o echipa si pina in 1989 am terminat tot pascaniul
792154 in anul 2000 am renuntat la tehnologia veche si am investit in alte retele care permiteau transmiterea pina la 90 de programe retele de internet si telefonie pe acelesi cablu pentru care am facut un credit in banca de 4 milioane de euro investitia m a costat in jur de 350 400 de euro pe cap de abonat nu as fi vindut niciodata reteau de cablu dar am ajuns la un nivel al concurentei pe care nu l mai puteam acoperi investitiile in comunicare s au dezvoltat mult si au afectat firmele de tipul meu
792155 am venit in firma ca simplu angajat in anul 1994 pe vremea aceea eram asistent la universitate si predam electrotehnica m am angajat la radix part time pentru ca in viata de familie aparuse un copil si atunci trebuia sa suplimentez veniturile am lucrat la carat cutii de calculatoare si dupa doi ani cu vreo 300 500 de euro la cursul zilei de azi bani proveniti din salariu si bonusurile primite pe jumatate de an am cumparat 13 din actiunile firmei
792156 in 1996 am deschis un birou la bucuresti era practic prima companie it din iasi la bucuresti obisnuiti sa ne luptam pentru clientii nostri atunci am fost bine primiti si ca urmare am avut si primul nostru mare client mobifon actualul vodafone lucru care ne a ajutat foarte mult in dezvoltarea noastra
792157 in 2005 am vindut radix contra sumei de 7 milioane de euro
792158 am vindut firma dar in orice antreprenor ramine o dorinta de a realiza noi afaceri pe viitor voi investi in imobiliare dar doar in regiunea de nord est pentru care mi am luat consilieri ca sa inteleg mai bine demersurile
792159 am insistat ca proiectarea si constructia sa fie licitate separat tocmai pentru ca este o lucrare complexa si de migala de asemenea termenul de executie din caietul de sarcini va fi de 18 luni tocmai pentru ca sa fie selectata o firma puternica si nu una de apartament care detine o roaba si un telefon
792160 termenul cel mai optimist de incepere a lucrarilor in varianta in care nu vor exista contestatii la licitatie este jumatatea lunii septembrie
792161 cladirea filarmonicii este formata din trei corpuri ridicate in epoci diferite la fiecare dintre aceste imobile este nevoie de anumite tipuri de lucrari de exemplu corpul 1 sau casa alecu bals este deja reabilitata structural ea va fi mansardata iar noile lucrari vor viza doar interioarele in aceasta parte de cladire va fi amenajata o sala mica de concerte cu o capacitate de 278 de locuri o sala de repetitii rectoratul universitatii de arte precum si foaierele
792162 in primul rind este necesara consolidarea acestui imobil care se va face folosind solutii moderne reversibile cu pastrarea formei si aspectului actual important este si fapul ca imobilul va fi izolat si nu se vor mai simti vibratiile de la tramvaie
792163 corpul de cladire este foarte degradat si nu are valoare istorica ca functionalitate ci ca fatada vom reconstrui o cladire cu subsol parter etaj si mansarda aceasta solutie de revitalizare a imobilelor nefunctionale dar cu caracteristici arhitecturale deosebite este des folosita in strainatate si a inceput sa fie adoptata si in romania iar la iasi este in premiera
792164 acesta este elementul principal de noutate partile din spate ale cladirilor monument de pe strada cuza voda arata ca un gunoi in spatele filarmonicii se va putea intra din ambele parti prin ganguri iar dincolo vor fi amenajate spatii verzi si un amfiteatru in aer liber

792197 am vazut o atitudine imbecila la un comandament de inundatii la un ministru care a cerut sa vina primarii la el primarii erau pe teren si ministrul se dusese la comandament si le spunea tuturor sa vina la el atunci mi am dat seama ca imbecilul ala nu avea contactul cu realitatea

792527 making a video of earth from so far away helps the search for other life bearing planets in the universe by giving insights into how a distant earth like alien world would appear to us
792528 to image earth in a similar fashion an alien civilisation would need technology far beyond what earthlings can even dream of building
792529 the video will help us connect a varying point of planetary light with underlying oceans continents and clouds and finding oceans on extrasolar planets means identifying potentially habitable worlds
792530 a sun glint can be seen in the movie caused by light reflected from earths oceans and similar glints to be observed from extrasolar planets could indicate alien oceans
792531 you can toggle the properties up and down just by adding or subtracting the metal
792532 it means we can regulate the materials properties based on one treatment in a way thats cheap and easy to do but doesnt produce a lot of toxic by products
792533 wed love to have that kind of data but we just cant access them
792534 it doesnt surprise me that there are these kinds of pains given the early stage of development and the long time since we did anything like this nasa is trying to do this with inadequate and uncertain funding
792535 but officials in the agency have been aiming for a 2013 launch that no longer seems likely

792540 it would be like looking at a boulder on top of a hill without asking what it took to get it there
792541 probably somewhere beyond the fifty years that it will take for us to return and colonize the moon
792542 after many years of controversy we finally have very convincing evidence that the expected disc is truly there
792543 the emission from hot dust grains in the surroundings is so strong that it buries emission from the accretion disc so we just couldnt see it
792544 it looks like the standard picture is correct which really moves the field of quasars forward
792545 for the first time astronomers have seen discs of hot matter swirling onto huge black holes
792546 after many years of controversy we finally have very convincing evidence that the expected disc is truly there
792547 for the first time seen discs of hot matter swirling onto huge black holes
792548 the first object to be formed in the universe is a very tiny protostar with mass just 1 of the sun
792549 for the first time one simulation in one go has followed the evolution from cosmological initial conditions on scales of millions of light years all the way to the initial protostar on scales of a few solar radii
792550 they might explode as a very bright supernova disrupting the entire star

792552 we named it after the witch from hansel and gretel who saw her final demise by being pushed into an oven

792555 were looking beyond finding water to finding habitats for life
792556 the solid rocket booster was not designed to lift this kind of load or to have something stacked on top of it
792557 we looked at a similar system and its true that it would be cheaper for going to the moon
792558 but its expensive to use these big rockets to go to the space station
792559 all were asking is for an independent apples to apples comparison of the two plans
792560 we need to actually field a system not engage in more paper studies and reviews
792561 at this point i am not seeing any significant interest in this direct alternative within the halls of congress
792562 living in a void testing the copernican principle with distant supernovae
792563 there is no fractal or inhomogeneous physical model of the universe of any kind therefore although there are particular observations that present a challenge to the standard model there is no sense in which there is a preferred model that predicts or is explained by inhomogeneity so the observations are interesting but without a physical model to back them up they are unlikely to have an impact on our thinking about cosmology
792564 a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals a reconstruction that changes some of the fields most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications
792565 by ensuring that the paradigm will not be too easily surrendered resistance guarantees that scientists will not be lightly distracted and that the anomalies that lead to paradigm change will penetrate existing knowledge to the core
792566 still if cosmologists hold the copernican principle to be unquestionable then science becomes something more akin to religion
792567 the assumption for instance that the speed of light is some 300 000 km sec in our neighborhood doesnt mean it is everywhere
792568 star formation is something we dont really understand even if its not near a black hole
792569 before this there was basically no evidence of star formation within the molecular gas
792570 were viewing this as the last sample the instrument may see
792571 we werent sure how much material could come through and it looks like we got the maximum material that we could get with those drill holes

792579 in america 18 000 americans die each year because they cannot afford health care according to the institute of medicine of the national academy of science many more get sick or become sicker
792580 these people up in canada stumbled upon something 30 years ago its called a universal human right health care and preventive health as well if they do it 30 years ago we can do it now
792581 every generation of americans has worked to strengthen that legacy to make our country a place of freedom and opportunity a place where people who work hard can rise to their full potential a place where their children can have a better future millions of americans are just a pink slip away from losing their health insurance and one serious illness away from losing all their savings millions more are locked into the jobs they have now just because they or someone in their family has once been sick and they have what is called a preexisting condition and on any given day over 37 million americans most of them working people and their little children have no health insurance at all forty years from now our grandchildren will also find it unthinkable that there was a time in this country when hardworking families lost their homes their savings their businesses lost everything simply because their children got sick or because they had to change jobs our grandchildren will find such things unthinkable tomorrow if we have the courage to change today

792592 and when i got to washington i saw that public policy is really made in a room at a table there were real seats at the table well imagine what has happened to public policymaking now there is a real room with a window and a door and theres two seats at the table the window is for us to look through while our representatives make policy for us so we can see what theyre doing at the table one seat is for the democrats one seat is for the republicans now we dont know who did it but one of them put a lock on the door and slipped a key to the corporate lobbyists who can come and go at will and whisper what they want to democrats and republicans and the result is that we the people who pay for those seats and determine who sits in them want one thing but because the corporate lobbyists can come and go at will our values get overridden and our representatives give us something else thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against the war and occupation but war and occupation still gets funding thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre against illegal spying on innocent people yet end up with a telecom immunity bill being signed into law thats how we end up with everyone saying theyre in favor of universal access to healthcare and no one supporting what the physicians nurses and healthcare really want and thats a single payer healthcare system in this country

792600 barack has played the race card non stop throughout his run as an african american i know what the bi racial blunders doing hes trying to egg up support from the african american community hes trying to turn us into his street team his okey doke and all of that other bull was an attempt back in the primaries it is the only card he has left to play and its not going to play in a general election
792601 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this

792606 we as parents are well aware of the importance of our teachers who teach and program our children we also know how important it is for our children to play with good thinking children growing up sen barack obama has grown up with the teaching of very angry militant white and black people the rev jeremiah wright louis farrakhan william ayers and rev michael pfleger we cannot say we are not affected by teachers who are militant and angry we know too well that we become like them and mr obama will run this country in their mindset the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america the democrats have targeted young people knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds i know this process well i was caught up in the hysteria during the vietnam era which was brought about through marxist propaganda underlying the so called peace movement the radicals of that era were successful in giving the communists power to bring forth the killing fields and slaughter 2 5 million people in cambodia and south vietnam did they stop the war or did they bring the war to those innocent people in the end they turned their backs on all the horror and suffering they helped create and walked away those same leaders who were in the streets in the 60s are very powerful today in their work to bring down the iraq war and to attack our president and they have found their way into our schools william ayers is a good example of that thank god today we have a strong generation of young soldiers who know exactly who they are and what they must do to protect our freedom and our democracy and we have the leadership of gen david petraeus who has brought hope and stability to iraq and prevented the terrorists from establishing a base in that country our soldiers are lifting us to an example of patriotism at a time when weve almost forgotten who we are and what is at stake if mr obama had his way he would have pulled our troops from iraq years ago and initiated an unprecedented bloodbath turning over that country to the barbarianism of our enemies with what he has openly stated about his plans for our military and his lack of understanding about the true nature of our enemies theres not a cell in my body that can accept the idea that mr obama can keep us safe from the terrorists around the world and from iran which is making great strides toward getting the atomic bomb and while a misleading portrait of mr obama is being perpetrated by a media controlled by the democrats the obama camp has sent out people to attack the greatness of sen john mccain whose suffering and courage in a hanoi prison camp is an american legend gen wesley clark who himself has shame upon him having been relieved of his command has done their bidding and become a lying fool in his need to demean a fellow soldier and a true hero this is a perilous time and more than ever the world needs a united and strong america if god forbid we live to see mr obama president we will live through a socialist era that america has not seen before and our country will be weakened in every way

792651 it gives us a good opportunity to evaluate the freshman class the upper classmen are much farther along then the newcomers this allows us to move at a slower pace with the freshmen and evaluate their physical skills when newcomers get confused in the first few days of practice they dont usually perform as well so we are trying to minimize that by giving them more hands on coaching

792685 today we talk to some oklahomans who claim to have left homosexuality
792686 the position that creates the lingo will win the debate
792687 orthodox while reverencing this inheritance from the past are also well aware that not everything received from the past is of equal value among the various elements of tradition a unique pre eminence belongs to the bible to the creed to the doctrinal definitions of the ecumenical councils these things the orthodox accept as something absolute and unchanging something which cannot be cancelled or revised the other parts of tradition do not have quite the same authority
792688 the whole system of doctrine church government worship and art which orthodoxy has articulated over the ages
792689 tradition is the life of the holy spirit in the church
792690 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle
792691 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth
792692 by definition a council cannot be a true council if it formulates heterodox doctrines
792693 vegetarianism is the thing which vegetarians have practiced throughout the ages
792694 take the holy spirit out of this equation or teachings such as 1 tim 3 15 and rationalistic arguments are more appropriate
792695 tradition is the life of the holy spirit in the church
792696 the holy spirit has infallibly guided and preserved the church since pentecost
792697 voices of the fathers as evidence for the faith of the church
792698 those groups are by definition no longer part of the visible church
792699 the roman catholics think they are the one true church
792700 from your perspective the orthodox churchs teaching is the standard by which all things are judged
792701 there is no external standard to determine who the orthodox fathers and saints are
792702 the orthodox fathers and saints are simply those men and women who are united to christ in the church i e members mainly through baptism and who have been recognized and honored as holy people who theologize correctly about god
792703 there is no external plumb line this is a mysterious process that can take time and it requires faith to believe that the holy spirit does this each person has to decide for himself whether the orthodox or roman catholic claims are true
792704 the holy spirit leads the body of christ into the truth helping the faithful to recognize and affirm that which has been officially decided in a god pleasing council
792705 accusations of begging the question will fall on deaf ears
792706 the two largest christian bodies in the world are making these exclusive claims if they are right im not in the church who is right did the church prior to the great schism five hundred years before protestantism even existed believe as i do in my then current anglican beliefs i need to find out
792707 there isnt anything to debate because you have to just let the holy spirit show you
792708 go pray about it and visit parishes and the holy spirit will show you
792709 you write that there is a visible church that has been guided by the spirit in preserving truth over time
792710 if the church is not infallible under any conditions could the whole visible church teach heresy and fall away or is that impossible
792711 if the bible is the only infallible rule of faith who is the judge to apply that rule and with what authority does such a person apply the rule
792712 is there a vicious circularity in arguing that the gospels are reliable and record the resurrection and then the resurrection confirms the gospels as inspired if not why not
792713 the gospels are reliable and record the resurrection and the resurrection confirms the gospels as inspired
792714 if you adhere to the reformed teaching then you believe it is possible for god to predestine you to think that you are elect and in fact not be if this were so every piece of evidence you appealed to to falsify the idea that you were reprobate would be compatible with the above state of affairs how then does the reformed doctrine of predestination support an objective assurance and not lapse into the kind of subjectivism you find problematic
792715 what if the thing that is causing my thoughts has caused me to think that i am a christian when i am really not
792716 robins main line of attack seems to be an epistemological argument to the effect that one cannot have the church as the criteria for orthodoxy and heterodoxy without knowing independently from the church what constitutes orthodoxy and heterodoxy
792717 muddled with this is a subsidiary argument concerning private judgment
792718 there is clearly a difference between meeting the conditions on knowledge and meeting the conditions on producing normative and binding judgments
792719 a subsidiary objection made by robin which is off topic is that the orthodox are not in a position to know which councils are normative
792720 robin objects that there is no external test for councils even if this were so it doesnt follow that if there is no external test that there is no rational or internal test part of the problem is that robin is supposing some theory neutral realm of facts that he can measure his models against i am not sorry to say that there is no such thing this doesnt mean that i reject the idea of objective reality but rather i reject the idea that objective reality is theory neutral

792742 we were disappointed that the treasury had not modelled what impact the rebanding of existing cars will have on carbon emissions
792743 presumably this means the treasury does not have any idea of what levels of ved will either persuade people to trade in their existing cars sooner than they would otherwise or choose a more efficient model when they next come to buy a second hand car
792744 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
792745 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according its own projections is of limited benefit
792746 both the proposed changes in ved rates and the objectives of ved as an environmental tax have been poorly explained and communicated
792747 suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
792748 will distort the second hand market and leave motorists driving inefficient cars with many suffering a loss in resale value
792749 it is only when a car is taken off the road and scrapped that there is an environmental gain

792772 barack obama alienates europeans by favoring death penalty and right to bear arms
792773 what is politically interesting is that obama has arguably switched to the right on two key issues for conservatives in the last week gun control and the death penalty which brings up the old issue of flip flopping again does this make him a flip flopper or a savvy politician that probably depends on whether obama can argue his switch convincingly what do you think
792774 ms sanders saw it plain all around her though people refused to rewrite the ending to her daughters murder clinging to the belief that mr fritz and mr williamson somehow had been part of the killing a spurning of reality so common that it has practically become an epidemic as dna tests year in and out clear the wrongfully convicted
792775 a state contractor tampered with marylands cancer registry a database used by researchers to track the diseases impact counting hundreds of patients as having cancer when they did not according to a legislative audit released yesterday the company macro international inc found in an internal investigation that data were deliberately altered between august 2004 and december of that year the company fired the employee responsible for the cancer registry state officials said that macro employees apparently overreported the incidence of cancer to ensure that the database met standards set by a national certification association which closely monitors registries to ensure that states have a complete count of cases
792776 in yet another example of the health industry mishandling private patient records blue cross and blue shield of georgia sent some 202 000 explanation of benefits letters to the wrong addresses last week the atlanta journal constitution reports the letters which were mistakenly directed to the addresses of other policyholders included names and insurance identification numbers of patients as well as the names of the doctors and other medical providers they were using a small proportion of the letters also had social security numbers a spokeswoman for the company told the paper vulnerability to identity theft is one concern but eob letters are especially sensitive from a privacy standpoint because they contain some treatment information and this is one of a steady stream of mistakes by the health care industry when it comes to protecting electronic data blue cross and blue shield of georgia told the ajc that a computer system change was to blame and its taken steps to avoid the problem in the future
792777 say it will have many benefits including decreasing medical errors which harm least 1 5 million people every year according to the institute of medicine doctors scrawl will be replaced with typed information and potentially dangerous interactions with patients existing medications will be flagged
792778 transforming prescriptions from scrawl into a standardized electronic format can make them even easier for pharmacies to sell and trade violating patient privacy says tim sparapani senior legislative counsel for the american civil liberties union

792791 this is intentional it was impossible to back port the 3 4 swt xulrunner to the version of the sdk were shipping
792792 this issue also causes eclipse to crash if the javadoc view is opened and will prevent it from being restarted until xulrunner is completely disabled in eclipse ini
792793 a recent blog entry has implied that this situation is simple to fix on red hats part and that red hat is unwilling to do so this is far from the truth the problem is that firefox was updated in rhel 5 and this caused an incompatibility issue with the swt shipped in rhel 5 the problem is solved in the latest release of eclipse 3 4 but we cannot back port that code into eclipse 3 2 and we cant upgrade to latest eclipse because of rhel 5 dependencies so our only choice was to disable the internal web browser
792794 the xulrunnerpath variable support was added post 3 2 1 which is what we are shipping in rhel 5 according to the cvs logs it was only added on 2008 03 12 for 3 4

792801 based on hair analysis snitches and a couple of bogus confessions ron was given the death penalty
792802 he was set free without an apology no one has the courage to say they were wrong the state wants you to go away and not make any noise
792803 the challenge now is to convince a lot of comfortable white people that there are a lot of innocent people in prison
792804 this system if we think its so great how can this system send 130 men to death row and later have them exonerated

792831 by your current standards you would not have voted for reagan either he was elected because americans perceived him to be a no nonsense principal who could deal with the spread of communism across the globe and a fiscal conservative who would pull the carter read socialist economy out of the mire as important as the pro life issue is most ignored his expansion of abortion rights as california governor and elected him president you it is apparent would not have

792851 internet explorer used to be able to browse the file system beginning with ie7 that became history both on xp and vista if you enter a file system path into the ie7 address bar it will open a new windows explorer window to that path from a security perspective it seems like a pretty good idea not to allow the main program that interacts with that hostile world known as the internet to also interact with your file system in the same way
792852 one thing youll hopefully notice is that the uac elevation prompt for internet explorer shows it as

792863 every day was filled with tremendous amounts of unbelievable stress and fear for my life
792864 when i was released from prison after having spent several days with my daughter elizabeth my mother and i returned to kansas city where i now reside my mom owned a 1966 malibu chevy that at very first sight i was itching to get behind the wheel although i did not have a drivers license i got behind the wheel and put the key in the ignition there i was driving down the road as a free man with zeal in my pounding heart that was sending cold chills rushing down my spine i realized that i had not forgotten how to drive a car after 12 long years it was great that is until i noticed that the gas gauge was on empty i headed straight for the nearby convenience store with 5 in my wallet i pulled up to the gas pumps got out and then realized that i didnt know how to pump gas it was a very strange feeling i didnt want to go inside the store and ask the attendant how to pump gas surely he would have called the looney wagon to pick me up and take me away to the funny farm i stood there pondering what to do then from out of nowhere the gas pump started talking to me i froze the words what did i do wrong blurted out in my mind i quickly jumped into the car and sped away with the thought that the police would be right behind me at any time
792865 saturday march 29 2008 non citizen jurors yesterday the california commission on the fair administration of justice held its final public hearing on the use of the death penalty in california ca death penalty juries under scrutiny kcbs news state commission hears voices on both sides of death penalty debate san jose mercury news one of the recommendations from the hearing was that more people of color should serve on juries deciding capital cases the commission went on to discuss the need to go beyond drivers license rolls to find potential jurors this finding nor the subsequent recommendation were surprising or even new to anyone vaguely familiar with the issue
792866 in 28 states including nevada people who serve time and then are found innocent get nothing theyre just supposed to pick up their lives right where they left off even if theyve been in prison for years thats not how it works
792867 honestly i havent been cleared yet and id love to see that happen
792868 but this isnt about me anymore its about giving any innocent person in a jail cell some hope i cant even describe what it feels like to be in that position
792869 i had to sell my car just to get started but thats ok ive never been political in my entire lifetime until this happened and i dont have quitting in me
792870 there are many many other people out there its my opinion on death row that are innocent
792871 most of the time i dont think the state should be in the business of killing its citizens
792872 but then comes along some particularly heinous murder and i think you know that person may really deserve to die for that crime
792873 people dont want to always admit it but mistakes do happen
792874 i want to make sure that the person regardless of race is the right person being executed
792875 i want the man who killed my daughter to suffer until its gods decision when he goes
792876 i know what thats like and i want him to experience it forever
792877 under the current system we definitely need to make sure we have our facts straight before we keep killing people
792878 my sense is this is a vehicle to totally do away with the death penalty

792947 one of the essential characteristics of the computer grid is the interconnection of stores of information

792953 trouble is brewing for uk prime minister gordon brown and his labour government
792954 some obama backers are right to worry that the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
792955 its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
792956 what we have learnt this week is that when the republican attack machine cranks up as hillary clinton predicted obama is actually pretty vulnerable
792957 obama will put his face on the 100 bill mccain w video

792964 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
792965 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
792966 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
792967 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
792968 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
792969 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
792970 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
792971 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
792972 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
792973 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

792975 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
792976 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
792977 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
792978 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
792979 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
792980 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
792981 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
792982 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
792983 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
792984 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
792985 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
792986 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
792987 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
792988 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
792989 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good

792994 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
792995 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
792996 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
792997 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
792998 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
792999 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
793000 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
793001 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
793002 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
793003 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
793004 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
793005 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
793006 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
793007 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
793008 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
793009 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
793010 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
793011 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
793012 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
793013 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
793014 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
793015 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
793016 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
793017 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
793018 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
793019 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
793020 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
793021 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
793022 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
793023 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
793024 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
793025 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
793026 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life

793034 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
793035 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
793036 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
793037 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
793038 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
793039 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
793040 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
793041 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
793042 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
793043 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
793044 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

793052 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
793053 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
793054 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
793055 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
793056 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
793057 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
793058 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
793059 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
793060 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
793061 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
793062 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
793063 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
793064 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
793065 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
793066 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
793067 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
793068 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
793069 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
793070 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
793071 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
793072 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
793073 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
793074 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
793075 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
793076 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
793077 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
793078 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
793079 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
793080 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
793081 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
793082 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
793083 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
793084 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
793085 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
793086 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
793087 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
793088 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
793089 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge

793112 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
793113 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
793114 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
793115 if you lie with dogs you are going to get fleas

793118 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
793119 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
793120 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
793121 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
793122 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
793123 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
793124 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
793125 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal
793126 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
793127 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
793128 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
793129 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
793130 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
793131 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
793132 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
793133 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
793134 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
793135 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
793136 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
793137 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
793138 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
793139 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
793140 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
793141 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
793142 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
793143 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
793144 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
793145 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
793146 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
793147 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
793148 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
793149 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
793150 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
793151 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
793152 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
793153 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
793154 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
793155 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
793156 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
793157 i choose to reach across the aisle with john kerry to protect homeowners against foreclosure
793158 kerry advocates all kinds of additional socialism at home appeasement abroad and what that means is weakness for the future
793159 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
793160 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
793161 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
793162 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
793163 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
793164 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
793165 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
793166 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
793167 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
793168 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
793169 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
793170 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
793171 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
793172 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
793173 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
793174 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
793175 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
793176 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
793177 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
793178 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
793179 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
793180 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
793181 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
793182 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
793183 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
793184 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
793185 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
793186 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
793187 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
793188 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
793189 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
793190 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
793191 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
793192 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
793193 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
793194 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
793195 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
793196 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
793197 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
793198 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
793199 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
793200 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
793201 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
793202 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
793203 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
793204 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
793205 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
793206 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
793207 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
793208 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
793209 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
793210 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
793211 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
793212 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
793213 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
793214 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
793215 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
793216 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
793217 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
793218 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
793219 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
793220 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
793221 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
793222 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
793223 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
793224 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
793225 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
793226 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
793227 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
793228 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
793229 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
793230 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
793231 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
793232 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
793233 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
793234 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
793235 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
793236 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
793237 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
793238 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
793239 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
793240 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
793241 there is no mountain over which you can see the future

793249 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
793250 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life

793261 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
793262 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80

793264 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
793265 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
793266 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
793267 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
793268 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
793269 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
793270 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
793271 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
793272 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well

793277 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
793278 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
793279 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
793280 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
793281 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
793282 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue

793292 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation

793296 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
793297 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
793298 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
793299 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
793300 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

793306 pandangan seorang karyawan terhadap pekerjaan dan pengembangan diri berbeda beda dalam setiap generasi karena itu untuk meningkatkan kepuasan kerja dan produktivitas dibutuhkan pendekatan yang berbeda pula

793313 content creation in second life and providing consulting services in the metaverse requires a range of skill sets such as communications technical and creative having lived there for several months in 2005 i know from direct experience that cebu has a strong pool of talented individuals who are more than able to be competitive in the global market this important factor along with the incredible location and obvious cost savings left no question in my mind to base the operations in the city of cebu
793314 the challenges i encounter are common across businesses that operate in multiple locations and time zones for example our schedules do not sync up sometimes and although there are several hours of the day that our work overlaps we cannot all attend the same events on occasions for more important events we just make it a point to plan ahead of time and make notes on our calendars
793315 being a relatively new company a big portion of our expenses for 2007 and 2008 went to the allocation of start up costs however we are meeting our financial targets and revenues are increasing at a regular pace
793316 the large sized outfits are few and far between electric sheep millions of us anshe chung studios and river runs red for example are the only ones who have over 30 or more employees other service providers have a staff of 10 or more but primarily contract their work on an as needed basis then on the other side of the spectrum there are independent builders who work by themselves and offer their services freelance so avatrian sits comfortably in the middle of this variation
793317 it is hard to get definitive statistics on the number of residents in second life and virtual worlds per country and it is true that the use of the most common virtual world platforms is still limited in the philippines however the same can be said for many other countries in asia with the exception of japan many asian countries still have to do a bit of catch up in terms of participation in the virtual world and economy
793318 i think the high level of literacy the english language proficiency and our ability to integrate new technology into our lives make it possible and even advantageous for filipinos to engage in businesses involving virtual worlds there are already filipinos in second life who are running successful companies in sl casa del shai by shai delacroix and hodgepodge by isadora fiddlesticks for example have garnered brand name recognition for their work in sl
793319 we are participating in local job fairs to meet and hopefully recruit new graduates who are a good fit for the company
793320 instead i would advise not to look at it as a get rich quick scheme it is important to know that like any other real world business it is not easy but if you have the passion for it feel that there is a niche that you can fulfill and you see a demand that is not currently provided to the market then those are very good foundations for beginning a virtual enterprise
793321 we provide independent software vendors and entrepreneurs a complete end to end platform for the deployment delivery and management of web applications
793322 when we talk about activities we focus on areas which can contribute greatly to building a base of customers and these are our grassroots efforts

793344 a diez a os de esta reforma la crisis deficitaria en el imss se ha agravado en cambio las afores han obtenido ganancias por 26 mil millones de pesos m s de siete millones de pesos diarios mientras la esperanza de los trabajadores cotizantes al imss es t trica aspirando a pensionarse con un monto del 35 de su ltimo salario promedio anual
793345 y en un proceso legislativo apresurado que dur tan s lo quince d as en ning n momentro se ha establecido un debate real cara a cara entre quienes defienden la nueva ley del issste y quienes pretendemos una reforma que parta de una real y amplia consulta a los interesados
793346 la lucha sigue y se intensificar en los pr ximos meses con la segunda ronda de amparos y otras medidas
793347 los integrantes del movimiento democr tico nuevo sindicalismo nos sumamos a esta iniciativa que pretende dar voz y decisi n a los miles de trabajadores derechohabientes del issste y ciudadanos que fueron ignorados por las decisiones cupulares del gobierno federal y de los legisladores del pan pri panal y pvem

793351 como gobierno hay preocupaci n sobre la regulaci n y cumplimiento de las normas en el sector por eso se ha ido avanzando en dictar las normativas pertinentes como lo demuestra la promulgaci n el lunes pasado de la ley 20 215 que regula la jornada laboral de los trabajadores dependientes del comercio
793352 creemos que naturalmente hay que seguir avanzando hay que pesquisar adecuadamente la relaci n trabajador y empresa que siempre tienen un marco de ciertas confusiones por eso hemos dicho que nos interesa avanzar en negociaci n con el empleador pero con el empleador verdadero en el mundo de retail a veces eso est un tanto confuso y es una pesquisa que hay que realizar y es bueno avanzar en eso

793356 we required a solution that integrated with our existing eros eprocurement system and could quickly and easily provide product information at a patient level as well as at a theatre and surgeon level
793357 there was a frustration that the paper based stock management was a little hit and miss and nurses spent a lot of time doing this now they can spend more time with patients
793358 it needed to produce stock reports automatically replenish products when they were getting low allow us to analyse ordering trends and importantly enable us to determine how much each procedure and each surgeon is costing the trust to ensure we are cost effective
793359 we couldnt find a system on the market which fulfilled our criteria and so decided to work with coa solutions the provider of our eros system to develop a suitable solution from scratch it took just six months from the initial specification of the system through to the june 2008 go live and were delighted by the results
793360 obtaining patient level product information used to be time consuming using prm we can now quickly determine the exact cost of procedures so we can address areas where we are overspending for the first time we have an accurate view of stock levels across the trust
793361 by using prm with our theatre system and the introduction of the electronic patient record we will be able to calculate exactly how much each patient and each hospital area is costing us at any given time this is our ultimate goal enabling us to run the trust as cost effectively and as efficiently as possible
793362 stock management is an essential part of the nhs and efforts to address this should be welcomed this electronic system built with ardentia will enable trusts to do this in a much faster smoother and less labour intensive manner

793365 the war on greenhouse gasses is too important to be left to the environmentalists

793369 pound for pound making a prius contributes more carbon to the atmosphere than making a hummer largely because of the nickel in the hybrids battery
793370 if the new prius were placed head to head with a used car would the prius win dont bet on it making a prius consumes 113 million btus according to sustainability engineer pablo a single gallon of gas costs about 113 000 btus so toyotas green wonder guzzles the equivalent of 1 000 gallons before it clocks its first mile a used car on the other hand starts with a significant advantage the first owner has already paid off its carbon debt buy a decade old toyota tercel which gets a respectable 35 mpg and the prius will have to drive 100 000 miles to catch up

793384 these children still cannot understand or explain what happened to their mother she was with them one moment and gone the other there is no one to take care of them
793385 when they came wearing saffron headbands and faces covered with black cloth my mother told me to take my children and run she said no matter who they are they wont kill an old woman the last we heard was that they threw her from the roof of the house we didnt find her body
793386 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
793387 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
793388 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
793389 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
793390 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
793391 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
793392 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
793393 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously

793396 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
793397 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12

793447 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team

793453 i put my heart and soul into the job but if i kept on going my career could have come to an abrupt end i think this decision will prolong my career
793454 i thought it might be time to go in new zealand where my body was working well but my mind was not working well i will always cherish the support ive had but this is a weight off my shoulders
793455 i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
793456 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
793457 i also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen i can be ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and i hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the england team
793458 id like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have always been so supportive and have provided a huge inspiration to me as captain a captain is only as good as his teams and ive been fortunate enough to captain some terrific players and great blokes

793469 in the meantime completely disconnected to all this two boys who had received training in balochistan pakistan had been arrested they were being tracked for months after our inputs
793470 they mentioned a man who they said had carried out the varanasi blasts
793471 if we had a beat constable system he would have noticed three strangers at the seminary and inquired
793472 the beat drill failed and the ayodhya attack happened then waliullah was charged but the absence of pota prevention of terrorism act made it easy for him to get bail
793473 when he got bail he went to bangladesh and set up a network to send indian youth to help carry out bombings with training in pakistan

793563 where after all do universal human rights begin in small places close to home so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any map of the world yet they are the world of the individual person the neighborhood he lives in the school or college he attends the factory farm or office where he works such are the places where every man woman and child seeks equal justice equal opportunity equal dignity without discrimination unless these rights have meaning there they have little meaning anywhere without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world
793564 its been my experience that behaviorists are quick to recoil and become defensive with inquiry that challenges their
793565 both groups cite as evidence studies anecdotes and faux terminology to support their positions
793566 however they conveniently leave out from their marketing materials the fact that the children in that study were never randomized and were subject to physical aversives is that honest or is that protecting the dogma of behaviorism
793567 do scientists leave out very relevant facts no randomization and the use of physical aversives in discussing their results with prospective customers
793568 ready to strike rather than acknowledging that perhaps they could be wrong
793569 for instance and i dont mean to pick on interverbal here but when i stated that aba has caused ptsd in autistics based on information supplied to me by 2 autistics who had been diagnosed with ptsd as a result of undergoing aba as children and that there arent any studies that have been done to look into possible complications from aba such as ptsd his response wasnt what i would expect from a curious and science based person
793570 for instance and i dont mean to pick on interverbal here but when i stated that vaccines have caused autism in children based on information supplied to me by 2 children who had been diagnosed with autism as a result of undergoing vaccines as children and that there arent any studies that have been done to look into possible complications from vaccines such as autism his response wasnt what i would expect from a curious and science based person
793571 based on interverbals representation of behaviorists views there is no need to accumulate empirical data in order to draw a scientific conclusion
793572 one would think that those interested in human behavior would be curious about how their
793573 noam chomskey is a professor of linguistics at m i t and perhaps one of the most engaging and prolific intellectuals of the 20th century in 1971 the new york review of books published his essay
793574 it is possible to practice the techniques of behavior analysis and not philosophically be a behaviorist i would argue this happens regularly in clinical psychology
793575 the idea that it is faux terminology is the idea one would need to first prove
793576 actually not i wouldnt think and while perhaps this isnt important for other areas and not at all in scientific circles the practicing behaviorist still has the problem of free will if they dont believe in it then why are they bothering to hand out reinforcing items etc operant principles are predicated on the absence of free will and quite a few other things like creativity so its more of a necessity and less merely related from what i can see
793577 doubtful that anyone could disprove the assertion but chomsky gave us all very sound linguistic reasons for calling this into question as a reasonable way at looking at the development of language the review of verbal behavior is worth a read
793578 e ptsd and other side effects from what i can see its not the done thing to go looking for them see the kids who got worse and worse over the four years of the sallows and graupner study
793579 and theres the two tiny mites who had to be withdrawn from the howard et al study
793580 they acquired some non verbal skills but their receptive and expressive language skills did not improve and behavioral difficulties increased when the full number of intervention hours was attempted this led their ifsp teams to recommend transition to less intensive school programs
793581 there are a lot of anecdotes but most parents see the misfit between the program and the child and go looking for something else
793582 what bothers me is that the something else may cease to be an option if the dohertys of this world really had the welfare of asd kids at heart theyd make a push for services and leave the type up to the parents
793583 its still by and large a cognitive deprivation curriculum designed according to the wishes and goals of third parties
793584 here is my response all in the spirit of peer review though i still think your philosphy is dangerous
793585 its still by and large a cognitive deprivation curriculum designed according to the wishes and goals of third parties
793586 no shift i originally stated i thought your views on behaviorism were dangerous and still do
793587 but public education doesnt tout the 47 indistinguishable criteria nor charge 50 000 yr for a cognitive deprivation curriculum for a parent that just chucked out 50 grand on the promise of indistinguishable benchmarks its not a bland criticism
793588 and that is a fine criticism in general however relative alyrics critcism it is dreadful the fact that some behavior analysts provide inappropriate information doesnt change the fact that alyric provided a critcism true of nearly all educational methods logic doesnt work that way
793589 what is dangerous to me however is criticism delivered in the absence of science
793590 you must mean the lesser known behavior analysts not the household name ones correct
793591 dangerous to whom certainly not those in a powerless situation
793592 where is the science where is the replication of the 47 outside lovaas padewans
793593 what is dangerous to me is when torture is called something different when the person being tortured happens to be in a powerless minority dangerous to me is men like sallows who uses unethical and downright lies on his website to promote his services dangerous to me is this cult of personality that surrounds skinner and lovaas
793594 dangerous to you i assume is when i use terminology which you deem non scientific in a manner that isnt consistent with the dogma

793662 it is essential to try to be conscious of the assumptions you are making about what is possible and critically what is not possible to the extent that you can treat these as hypotheses to be rigorously challenged and tested rather than as assumptions that are taken for granted you reduce the potential to be predictably surprised people always learn with a point of view the key is to be open to altering that point of view in the face of reality

793746 the messenger peace and blessings of allah be upon him pbuh used to fast until we thought he would never break his fast and not fast until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah fasting for an entire month except in ramadan and i never saw him fast more than he did in shaban
793747 he used to fast all of shaban he used to fast all but a little of shaban
793748 i never knew of him meaning the prophet pbuh fasting for any entire month apart from ramadan
793749 i never saw him fast for any entire month from the time he came to madeenah apart from ramadan

793751 he observed more voluntary fasts in shaban than in any other month and he used to fast most of shaban
793752 i said o messenger of allah i do not see you fasting in any other month like you fast in shaban
793753 the most beloved of months for the messenger of allah pbuh to fast in was shaban and his fasting in shaban was continuous with his fasting in ramadan
793754 fasting in shaban is better than fasting in the sacred months and the best of voluntary fasts are those that are observed in the months closest to ramadan before or after

793803 there are no plans at the moment to review the gla we dont think extending its remit to the construction industry is the best way forward
793804 there are issues that need to be addressed but we dont think the gla has proved it can drive out rogue traders and until it does its powers should not be extended to the construction industry
793805 the gla currently covers the supply of largely unskilled workers into lower paid jobs in agriculture and food processing this is a huge contrast to the construction industry where agencies can place professionals for hundreds of pounds a day

793845 the employment gap for ethnic minorities is still extremely high interestingly around 12 of temporary workers are from an ethnic minority much higher than the uk average of 7 this shows that temporary work is being used as a stepping stone for ethnic minorities to enter the labour market recruitment agencies often provide a more flexible recruitment process which means that people from diverse backgrounds are more likely to succeed in securing employment

793853 it is pleasing to see the conservative party is waking up to the skills shortage facing the industry their pledge to offer employers a 2 000 bonus for taking on and training apprentices is just the encouragement needed to start quite simply the uk is failing to deliver enough labour as evidenced by the fact that the uk was 11th in the international skills competition at the world skills summit in 2007 britain is failing on two fronts first failing to meet demand and secondly failing to train enough people with the right skills to the right levels however the failure to address the skills shortage is as much about too few interested employers as it is about too few interested school leavers for example in 2007 30 000 young people applied for an apprentice position but only 8 500 were accepted this is within a sector in which there are approximately 185 000 construction companies within the uk but only 4 per cent of which employ an apprentice clearly the construction sector needs to be better motivated to reverse this situation if britain is to maintain its long term competiveness

793865 the letter from goddard consulting quite understandably drew our attention to the fact that we had not implemented all the recommendations within their 2005 report that is correct however this is a complex area where professional opinions may differ there are a number of recommendations where we felt that alternative ways of managing the hazard would be equally effective and the problems were addressed accordingly
793866 these are challenging times for the construction industry while many companies continue to enjoy good markets in the uk and overseas others particularly those with exposure to the uk residential market are facing challenging times
793867 setting up the new construction council is therefore particularly timely the councils new strategic role at the heart of the cbi will enable the whole sector to benefit from the cbis unrivalled access at the highest levels in whitehall westminster and brussels

793914 while we are working to provide public access to the alpine section of the sun road as quickly as is safely possible we do expect that it will be several weeks before the entire sun road is available
793915 this years plowing efforts have been hampered by an above average snowfall a cool spring and lingering snow in the alpine section our challenges were underscored by this weeks storm it brought 16 inches of snow to the loop 24 inches to road camp and 24 inches at siyeh bend the high avalanche danger also created unsafe plowing conditions the storm also brought down trees at lower elevations and they have since been removed from park roads
793916 its important that we dont take for granted the amazing work that our plowing crews undertake each year to prepare for the alpine sections opening the crews clear snow that can be more than 100 feet deep from the roads surface they work in a precarious environment the road is narrow has steep drop offs and is intersected by more than 70 avalanche paths we must be constantly vigilant to the conditions to ensure our crews safety ultimately when the dangers are too great we will temporarily stop plowing efforts in the alpine section
793917 the going to the sun road is now open the bad news is several of the trails are still snow covered and the wildflowers are going to be late this year

793962 he probably got so high he fell off the bed or he was reaching for these
793963 it really doesnt matter there is only one question we need to be asking ourselves right now does this death appear suspicious

793977 this is what it all comes down to this is where the normal people run screaming for the door are you screaming bern are you running

794003 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
794004 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
794005 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
794006 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
794007 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
794008 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
794009 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

794015 since when do the parties receiving payoffs on any real estate transaction look at offers
794016 this paragraph says a lot the banks attitude to short sales is very old school you apparently are an alumni of such a school the banks way of thinking and yours will hurt them significantly they and you are stuck in the past
794017 youre kidding right they have to see it to know whether theyll accept it
794018 that doesnt explain why the banks sit on their butts for months not responding try again to support the banks dealings with short sales
794019 approval is part of the escrow process not part of the offer process
794020 a dog is a dog a cat is a cat and a bank is a bank
794021 i assume the banks have a responsibility to their shareholders to manage the asset and get as much as they think they can out of it if that includes sitting on it hoping for a better offer than thats what we should expect if the bank decides its better to continue to get the payments out of the existing owner then why shouldnt they
794022 i think the problem is the banks let go many of their highly skilled and highly paid back office underwriters that you need to work through things like short sales

794115 look mom we are not going to cry at a sad movie sorry it would be embarrassing
794116 but they have to live and work in the world outside our family and guys dont go to the movies and cry in that world valid emotion or not
794117 and there is the overcompensation factor making up for a barely there father who had his own issues with this messy emotional business
794118 should i open the door for a date a female colleague who now might even be my boss there was also should i pay for this meal or will she be offended should i let her pay if she offers and risk looking cheap

794148 i happened to watch the sona but it was not worth hearing at all because i didnt believe in what she was saying the poor are still hungry lining up for rice everyday for a limited kilo the expanded vat is still there her speech had no soul sad to say sona must provide direction on major concerns which depicts the state of the nation of the past year not to report on what has been perceived as accomplishments of the government which she does not need to tell us because we know already no clapping is needed
794149 nothing really new but rehashed statistics that does not translate into food on the table of mang pandoy

794159 in our view the iphone is just another example of a connecting element and possibly the most critical one in apples quest to conquer the home market through its devices content and digital content distribution
794160 we believe that apples key challenges in the uk and the rest of europe with this product will be to fight consumers price sensitivity and to reach out to mainstream picky mobile users who want full content portability rather than a partial service however sexy it may appear

794348 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
794349 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
794350 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001

794393 the u s economy will not go into a recession as it has been traditionally defined there will be a bumpy ride particularly in the first six months of the year the traditional conversation will be an either or discussion will there be a recession or not while there will most certainly be economic indicators that will point to recession there will be others that do not the problem is not whether there is or is not a recession but rather the symptoms of a reorganization that is going on due to the flow to a global economy the view of the economic landscape is still too often looked at through traditional increasingly less valid historical national measurements that seem to no longer apply there will be pockets of recession such as in the state of michigan but the economic bumps in the road in 2008 will not fit into traditional national recessionary measurements

794490 we need to grow in the lord and teach our children how to do the same it takes more than just telling them they need to see our faith lived out

794550 there is no limit on the amount of sewage that can come out of these overflows they represent a licence to pollute
794551 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now because of the effects of climate change we are having a lot more rain the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should
794552 it amounts to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge

794571 the church in its wider life cant be committed definitively by the judgment of some but when a new thing is enshrined in whatever way in public order and ministry it will look like a definitive commitment
794572 is the need to avoid this confusion so that discernment continues together
794573 such interventions often imply that nothing within a province no provision made or pastoral care offered can be recognizably and adequately christian and this is a claim not lightly to be made by any christian community regarding any other without grave breach of charity
794574 represents the distillation of what the indaba groups have been saying and saying what would like to happen
794575 very difficult to come at a common mind about this
794576 will be difficult to uphold although there is a desire to do so from all quarters
794577 many differentiate between authorized public rites rather than pastoral support
794578 in the way that some people would have liked to answer them
794579 that doesnt cause me to lose too much sleep because the conference has never been an executive body that can simply make those thoughts of quick fix decisions
794580 id say the process of the conference rested on a particular assumption that bishops needed to speak to each other in a safe space and were capable of doing it respectfully and prayerfully
794581 needed to know how deep the commitment was on peoples part to staying together i think weve got a bit of an answer to that
794582 needed to know what forms of action and witness were still possible credible for even its wobbly state
794583 a strong level of agreement and support for a coherent and more coordinated attempt to do the work of the communion around issues of justice and international development
794584 seek ways in which they may be drawn into our deliberations and held in communion
794585 pastoral and not legal and should be able to respond quickly
794586 only with the consent of that province and in particular with the consent of the primate or the appropriate body
794587 the whole issue of homosexual relations is also highly sensitive because there are very strong affirmations and denials in different cultures across the world which are reflected in contrasting civil provisions ranging from legal provisions for same sex marriage to criminal action against homosexuals
794588 in the framework of the bishop in mission it is agreed that the ordination of a bishop living in a same gender union has compromised mission in many parts of the communion and has had a profoundly disruptive effect on the communion by detracting from other aspects of mission
794589 partnership in mission is lost and damaged as we are diverted from our primary focus in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost in some regions the issue has become a test of orthodoxy and a basis for hostile actions
794590 ecumenical and interfaith relationships have been damaged some ecumenical participants present underscored this point
794591 there have been positive effects in parts of canada the united states the united kingdom mexico and central america and in other parts of the world when homosexual people are accepted as gods children are treated with dignity and choose to give their lives to christ and to live in the community of faith as disciples of jesus christ with fidelity and commitment
794592 to repent of the ways in which our hardness of heart toward each other may have contributed to the brokenness of our communion at this present time
794593 we need to repent of statements and actions that have further damaged the dignity of homosexual persons people who have held traditional views on this matter have sometimes felt that they have been diminished with ridicule or contempt
794594 living independently means more than getting qualifications and securing a job
794595 expressing your sexuality and enjoying a relationship is something everyone values
794596 but poor sex education and fears about exploitation can stand in the way of this happening for people with learning disabilities
794597 information and skills must be available to people with learning disabilities so they can enjoy intimate relationships without putting themselves at risk
794598 fpa would like to see more recognition of the importance of sex and relationships in their lives
794599 i want to meet a girl i can become friends with take to the pub and the cinema and then after a couple of months see where it goes but its difficult out there
794600 people with a learning disability should have the same rights as anybody else to express their emotions and sexuality
794601 having the opportunity to develop personal relationships is an important part of a full life
794602 people with a learning disability should not be denied this because of prejudice or lack of accessible information
794603 however appropriate support must be in place so that people with a learning disability can make informed decisions about sex and those who dont have the capacity to consent to sexual activity must be protected
794604 reminiscent of benito mu advertisement ssolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
794605 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
794606 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
794607 this ruling is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it
794608 i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
794609 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not co advertisement unt the dead i just ran for my life
794610 we have now collected the pieces of nine dead women and still there are other parts scattered a minibus full of seriously injured women was rushed to hospital
794611 we received 46 injured including two men most of them serious the two men and two other women died in the emergency room
794612 alors l vous voyez cest la salle de bain et l cest la cuisine
794613 slavery or ensuring that somebody is kept in conditions close to slavery
794614 this movement is the most important movement in britain today
794615 we are here to give a message to the government and our message is very clear we have just 100 months in which to effect a massive transition away from a fossil fuel economy
794616 the governments addiction to fossil fuels is not only destroying the environment but also peoples lives now
794617 wispa is a true icon loved by its fans everywhere we brought it back temporarily to see if the desire was genuine but fans are still rallying so we took the decision to bring it back for good we know others have looked at wispa and tried to copy its success by bringing back other brands but we dont believe anyone has managed to recreate the same excitement
794618 documentaries of this nature play an important role in informing the public openly and transparently about the work of the police and uk border agency
794619 the home office do not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme
794620 the one thing in the lives of you mortals you can never change no matter how hard you try to deny it is your desire for love
794621 the combination of falling employment confidence and rising inflation expectations is a lethal cocktail for consumer spending
794622 the survey results suggest that spending growth is likely to slow sharply in the months ahead
794623 if people dont feel safe in their job and high prices are putting incomes under pressure then demand for discretionary purchases will naturally slow
794624 the survey shows that consumers are bracing themselves for the worst when it comes to the squeeze on the household purse
794625 should the bank of englands monetary policy committee be forced to increase interest rates over the months ahead then at least this will come as no surprise to consumers and limit any negative reaction
794626 that in many ways gay men lesbian women straights transgendered people and human beings in general have many universal feelings such as the desire for love and acceptance and the importance of family
794627 youre so smug is what gets me dont you ever think youre going to have to pay a price

794637 myspace has already become a must use platform for entertainment marketers looking to connect with young and highly engaged audiences
794638 and facebook offers an array of options for marketers through its pages function and its applications platform
794639 companies such as yahoo and microsoft have thousands of employees who use these tools to share and connect with their networks for both personal and business related purposes
794640 for companies like serena and others the intranet has clearly moved outside of the firewall
794641 social networking sites like facebook are a much more advanced communications phenomenon than the fax but not only are many businesses failing to take advantage of these free communication services some
794642 employee recruitment with job announcements targeted to students at select colleges with specific degrees can provide companies with a significant advantage over competitors searching for similar talent

794646 we had some dropped passes early were looking for guys that catch it i thought brian griese did a heck of a job today in the blitz period there were some good things dont get me wrong but weve got to catch the ball
794647 he has a little swelling on the knee hes going to be day to day we expect him back if not tomorrow the next day
794648 you know 56 of all penalties are for offsides illegal procedure and personal fouls to me those are three penalties that you can control as a football team and as a football player we jumped offsides on our own one foot line it was just a couple reminders i think after the family day and they got to sleep in we did a little conditioning
794649 ill get my six page report on joey here at lunch and well update you when we know more he does feel a lot better thats all i can say its very close to him returning and were excited about it
794650 hes getting a lot better jovan haye looks a lot better today also were really pleased with number one theyre not serious injuries and number two the progress that theyve made their return will probably be in the next few days to a week well let you know on that but we do like the progress thats being made theyre much better today
794651 yes thats basically what they do most of the time now rehab and do all that they can to get back out on the field we need them
794652 well were trying to find the front four the starters were trying to see who can play inside who can play outside what our best nickel rush combination is were trying to give these guys as many opportunities to rush as possible its a work in progress right now weve got some competition and with that being said were going to continue to see who fits where the best weve got a lot of answers to get
794653 yeah it was great it was great to see the players the turnout that we had was probably our best one we had a lot of people show up families and kids and i think its great for our players to have an opportunity to center and get back to family
794654 i really like him he did a heck of a job today he came in in the blitz period and he understands protections he understands where to go with the ball and when to get rid of him ive been pleased with his progress and where he is right now i really like the things that hes doing
794655 well diet wise just trying to cut back on the fast food and just stay away from the fast food mainly i stayed here the whole summer working with the strength and conditioning coaches they moved some weight around on me but i still weigh the same i would say the main thing i did this offseason was staying away from the fatty food
794656 i would say the main difference is i know the scheme a whole lot better i am not guessing with the plays and just knowing what to do when the situation comes up
794657 one thing with me is that i dont want anyone to say that i wasnt worth my fourth overall pick so everyday i come out and work hard and try to do the things that i need to do to improve my game obviously where i was drafted it comes with a lot of high expectations at the beginning it wasnt going my way but i just worked through it and things came out a little bit on top for me
794658 you want to show those guys that you can play just as much as you want to show the coaches you have to earn respect from the players and that comes from making plays
794659 as you can see from last year coming into this league i was just mainly a speed rush guy and at the beginning it obviously wasnt working for me as you said guys have seen that my first game it was coming up against seattle seahawk walter jones but it was a great experience for me it seemed like every time i came off the ball he was right there i just had to come with a counter move and as the season went on i got better at it
794660 i would say it was very helpful if i hadnt come on at the end of the season i might be in the same little slump that i came into last season with i am glad things worked out for me i leaned on chris hovan and kevin carter and those guys the veteran guys they were in my ear everyday telling me things are going to get better and fortunately they were right i just have to come out and just start from day one and get it running
794661 the expectations for this offensive line with us being young a lot of people are coming out saying that this is one of the best offensive lines that tampa has had thats just the words of the preseason we have to come out everyday one on one and rely on the person beside us to get better everyday and work hard
794662 once i start a game i want to finish every single one of them you have to know the difference between being injured and being hurt and i felt like i could play so i wanted to be out there for every single one of them
794663 i definitely can tell the line has improved by sitting down and watching the film after every single practice guys are being able to see the blitzes a lot faster than we were last year thats the family in us playing together for 13 games last year everybodys been able to pick up the blitzes a lot faster
794664 hes the older guy on the offensive line he comes out and shows us every single day hes not a guy thats going to show up and say a lot hes just going to be an example out there on the field by how he practices every single day
794665 the last time i ran gassers was probably my junior year back at the university of tennessee
794666 we were definitely in trouble today wasnt one of the best practices and coach jon gruden wanted to let us know that by making us run gassers he definitely got our attention weve got to come back later on today at 2 45 and be able to step it up with practice he came out and said it himself there were a couple of mistakes in practice that he wanted to get everybodys attention and thats his way of getting everybodys attention by making us run gassers
794667 everyday you come out you know the schedule everybody has to be on we have had a couple of days that havent been full like we expected but we have to be on
794668 the university of tennessee and the southeastern conference contributed a lot to me being in the state that i was in when i first stepped in here with the bucs all my praise goes back to tennessee for helping me come into the league and be successful in my first year
794669 the competition that you go through playing in the southeastern conference and also the coaches that we had at the university of tennessee
794670 once you get in the groove of things being a second year guy you start to read blitzes a lot faster

794696 what is most disturbing is the claim of several blackwater mercenaries we spoke with that they are here under contract from the federal government and the state of louisiana
794697 that raises a key question under what authority are blackwaters men operating a spokesperson for the homeland security department russ knocke told the washington post he knows of no federal plans to hire blackwater or other private security

794787 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts

795005 she is shocked and very much afraid as to what this is going to mean for her own life
795006 she has simply requested that we not put a spotlight of attention on her at the moment but people here knew her well spent a lot of time with her she was very gentle individual
795007 i just wanted to say that i am so so sorry for your loss my heart and soul are hurting with you and for you

795010 the survivor is located near the top of the mountain and he has been able to see search aircraft below him but we havent been able to see him

795021 a refugee claimant may not have typical documentation to support their claim

795024 gide seems true to himself even in his preciosities and his coquetry and it is with enchantment that i yield to his seduction
795025 admits that he always needs protestant atavism perhaps to justify his conduct by analysis and explanation and inquiry into hidden motives not for the satisfaction of proving that he was right to do as he did but because he claims the right to be as he is and because being as he is he could not behave otherwise than he does
795026 the great question in my life is the pain that one causes and not even the most ingenuous metaphysics can justify the man who has broken the heart that loved him
795027 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
795028 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
795029 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights

795059 lets catch our breath i need to summarize lion feels cowardly tin man thinks he has no heart scarecrow is brain dead and dorothy just wants to go home which ill allow because of the law

795071 judy o d d on the toilet 40 years ago and these other alter kakers have long since croaked from the usual clogged arteries i think we must be dead
795072 so what im hearing is that the tin man feels empty inside the lion has body image problems and the scarecrow feels he has no real weight in this world maybe we should get into dorothys abandonment issues
795073 so wait how did you accidentally get addicted to opiates
795074 i am in therapy to take care of some emotional trama associated with a baum scare you

795087 o k but i do know drew dernavich had a hand in this somewhere maybe that artwork on the wall
795088 so what i seem to be hearing from the group is that even though everyone got their hearts desires they still feel more or less empty and unfullfilled is that a fair assessment what a surprise eh you didnt see that what coming eh tin man strawman whats a mattah lion ya gutless wonder
795089 aunty em would you please ask your obviously gay companion to stop ogling the tin man hes creeping out the whole group

795282 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
795283 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
795284 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
795285 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
795286 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
795287 but the second thing we have 7 000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
795288 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be

795308 barack obama told a group of florida donors friday night that republicans will try to make voters afraid of him and suggested they would use his race to scare up votes for john mccain

795310 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife

795317 the truth is were finding an explosion in these kinds of hateful sentiments on the net and its a growing problem
795318 there are probably thousands of web sites that do this now i couldnt even tell you how many are out there because its growing so fast
795319 deans statement distributed in a press release was a political attack meant to raise questions among independent voters and as with most political attacks it turned a grain of truth into a misleading landslide of overheated accusation a review of the record shows that mccain has neither changed his position on torture nor taken sides with president bush on the substance of the issue

795388 despite the problems posed by high gas prices and the mortgage crisis suburban growth is still outpacing that of both urban and rural areas as not only homeowners but also businesses continue to locate in the suburbs the desire of americans for their own plot of land likely will continue well into the 21st century as well the community and family orientation of the millennial generation will only reinforce the continued growth of americas suburbs

795405 it is even more important than ever for alternattiva demokratika to participate fully in the discussions because the government of the day only commands a relative majority and represents less than half of the electorate
795406 because of the present electoral system alternattiva demokratika which represents two and half times the difference between the two parties in parliament 3810 voters does not have a seat in parliament it is therefore even more imperative that the committee discussing electoral systems and party financing should include ad in order to ensure the widest possible representation of the maltese electorate

795697 intermixed footage of that black candidate with images of two young white women
795698 should have all of his advisors and spokespeople be honest too
795699 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the 5 bills
795700 senator mccain is saying this afternoon he wants the american people to decide who is playing the race card in this campaign the first african american with a shot at winning the white house now under attack for saying something yesterday that he first said on the 20th of june to almost no response or the campaign that has in a tv commercial intermixed footage of that black candidate with images of two young white women in our fifth story on the countdown who do you think is playing the race card
795701 walked into the propellar blades of the new mccain strategy
795702 i think the mccain people watched what happened in the primaries saw that obama was able to maneuver the race issue to his advantage in many ways in states like south carolina which totally flummoxed bill clinton the mccain people decided they were not going to get in the same fix and they decided to go on the attack as part of their new attack strategy to distract attention from whatever substantive issues obama may be trying to raise in this campaign
795703 but also looking at the primaries and the obama experience in that is there a tipping point here i mean landstuhl britney spears and the race card in three days does mccain have to stop this at some point because others have tried this against obama and inevitably wound up painting themselves into a corner where they didnt just look initially they looked bitter and then they moved on to kind of obsessed looking
795704 well obviously mccains problem is he doesnt want to end up looking like jack nicholson in a few good men here but hes got a problem most of the republican conservative base doesnt like john mccain very much the only route he has to getting their support and getting them to show up it seems at least this is their theory is to demonize obama to draw out the republican base to go to the polls specifically to vote against this demon obama that seems to be the mccain strategy the risk for mccain is that he can lose whatever appeal he still has among independent voters i just spent the day in virginia keith looking at that swing state obamas running strong in the virginia suburbs but mccains got a shot there but if mccain does this day after day after day hes going to lose those independents in northern virginia
795705 theyre throwing everything against the wall and seeing what sticks this is john mccain in survival mode its not quite like the prison years but hes a tough character in a tough spot and hes going to use anything he can to survive and theyre getting some positive feedback they think from the polls including the latest gallup poll which shows the race daily tracking tightening again of course mccain isnt busting beyond 44 or 45 percent himself but at this point he doesnt seem to care if he can drag obama down to his level which hes trying to do trying to get obama in an alley fight thats exactly what mccain is trying to do
795706 well you cant take robert gibbss statement at face value you just cant it doesnt make any sense and i think its tactically wrong because obama is saying that democrats need to be on guard obama is saying that the country needs to be on guard obama is saying that its a challenge for the country to deal both with the positives and the negatives of his candidacy hes trying to be honest about it he should have all of his advisors and spokespeople be honest too
795707 yeah howard fineman of msnbc and newsweek as always howard great thanks
795708 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the 5 bills
795709 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the 5 bills
795710 well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new hes he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency
795711 hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills you know
795712 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale

795736 the iphone 3g has been the fastest selling phone ever in the uk but it is too expensive to be a realistic proposition in the pay as you go market

795740 were hoping well get some feedback from apple today well do our best to try to get the application back onto the app store if at all possible
795741 at the very least we hope apple will allow it to be used in countries where the provider does permit tethering

795751 if the licensee is advising the seller to refuse to respond there could be legal and ethical consequences
795752 within a reasonable time after the offer has been presented to the seller
795753 the parties understand that additional offers may be received by the sellers agent which must be presented to the seller pursuant to nevada law such offers may be accepted by the seller and forwarded to lender for review and approval

795761 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year

795763 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
795764 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
795765 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it
795766 when i saw the car on fire on the straight the smoke i thought it could be felipe but couldnt believe it
795767 i just tried not to do any mistakes and stay in front of him
795768 i didnt expect the podium its just the perfect weekend
795769 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
795770 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
795771 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
795772 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
795773 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
795774 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
795775 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
795776 while optima was busy telling everybody they were the largest australian pc manufacturer they failed to listen
795777 australia might not be that well known for technology but the public is willing to support the local underdog because australians value personal relationships and buy from people not companies
795778 panicking and following the multinationals down an increasingly direct sales path
795779 its true that optima might have lost many government deals by doing this but many of those were ultimately lost anyway
795780 the reach relationship and support of the dealer channel would have seen optima winning many more deals possibly under the radar and making a profit in the process
795781 instead optima took opportunities from loyal regional dealers affected their profit margins by targeting the mass market and built a consumer electronics retail business
795782 my message to all local whitebox builders is to learn from this and embrace your channel partners because they are your only unique business proposition
795783 let me be very clear on this we require the different media have the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games and i am adamant in saying there has been no deal whatsoever to accept restrictions
795784 ioc officials negotiated with the chinese so that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
795785 our requirements are the same from host city to host city and remain unchanged since the ioc entered into a host city contract with beijing in 2001
795786 when beijing was awarded the games the ioc required it to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games the ioc required this and this is what bocog beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad has said it will deliver

795792 young womens breasts are dense and if they get mammograms their breasts show up very white on mammograms and cancer shows up as white
795793 but as women get older their breasts are less dense and show up gray on a mammogram which makes it easy to identify the white cancer if there is a family history and women are worried they can start earlier and in this case a digital mammography may work better than a traditional mammography
795794 in fact most of the women who get mastectomies dont need them
795795 and for women to lose their breasts in addition to the normal emotional turmoil that they go through having breast cancer is harmful emotionally and physically
795796 women with early stage breast cancer usually do not need a mastectomy and will benefit from chemotherapy almost always
795797 women who get a lumpectomy will need radiation and thats the difference women who get a mastectomy will not need radiation but with a lumpectomy you always need radiation
795798 breast cancer in women younger than 30 is so rare and this is one of the things that concerns me
795799 i think the media focuses on young women because its so shocking when someone in their 20s gets cancer but what you end up with are women in their 20s and 30s who are terrified that theyre going to get cancer and women in their 50s who think they dont need to worry about it when the opposite is true
795800 its still a significant number but when you compare it to the overall number of women who get breast cancer its a small percentage
795801 what makes it fatal is if it goes into other parts of the body and gets into the lymph nodes lungs and other organs
795802 also if it gets into the blood or the bones it can kill a person thats the risk of metastasized cancer that means it has spread and once it hits the lymph nodes it can become out of control

795805 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
795806 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
795807 these data corroborate what many of us suspected that the epidemic is worse than we thought however it doesnt seem to be getting worse
795808 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
795809 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
795810 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
795811 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
795812 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
795813 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this
795814 i tell them to first explain about the disease how its transmitted how it cant be transmitted what it is
795815 and then they should tell them with confidence that they have it if they want

795840 to defeat this enemy it is far more than simply the military
795841 it will take a network interagency network international network that brings together department of the treasury brings together the state department brings together all the intelligence agencies brings together all of our law enforcement agencies so that we can develop a network both here in america and internationally to fight this network and defeat this network
795842 he instinctively can find the shining greatness of our american culture and does a good job of highlighting it although he also does have those rare lapses when he writes about hockey but that is something caused by impurities in the eastern waters or something
795843 once again the cardinals were terrible on special teams in 2007
795844 he instinctively can find the shining greatness of our american culture and does a good job of highlighting it although he also does have those rare lapses when he writes about hockey but that is something caused by impurities in the eastern waters or something
795845 its a problem for the club for sporting director pedja mijatovic and the coach
795846 but now wesley sneijder is injured and hes an important player for us maybe tomorrow there will be a meeting with the people in the club and maybe then theres going to be news about this
795847 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have any problem with him joining us
795848 real madrid making an offer is normal manchester united and coach sir alex ferguson dont want this because he is a very important player at united and that is normal too
795849 i think theyre going to have to talk about this and if cristiano ronaldo is coming to real madrid the dressing room is waiting for him
795850 if he came of course the players and the fans would be excited the supporters are used to watching the best players in the world at the bernabeu and cristiano ronaldo is one of the best players in the world
795851 i feel the best of real madrid is the squad and the dressing room and if cristiano is coming here we dont have room for him in the team
795852 but as i said before maybe with the injury to wesley sneijder maybe we need someone else
795853 i feel adebayor felt people questioned his commitment a little bit and the best way to give an answer is always on the pitch
795854 you play well and show you are ready to fight for your shirt and your team he does that he is a man with character
795855 you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly their frustration you have to show it with performances in this job
795856 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
795857 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances his first touch his much better and he moves the ball quicker his peneration and final ball is better
795858 the quality is there i dont look too much at his age just what he is doing on the pitch and at the moment the quality is good
795859 perhaps people will stop saying i dont produce english players now
795860 i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players but it is better i dont speak about names
795861 i dont know if barry will leave aston villa at the moment i am not on this case
795862 if we sign a player we will tell you but we are not close at the moment
795863 we are all really shocked about the injury its very difficult he has a lot of pain they have to do some tests but it doesnt look good
795864 on a day like this it was the last thing we wanted
795865 there was never a deal put on the table that was compelling enough that we as the board could look the shareholders in the eyes and say this is a good deal for you
795866 i think youve overpaid for executive compensation overplayed your hand with microsoft and overstayed your welcome
795867 they can regain my confidence but theyre going to have to prove themselves first
795868 competition is good for the industry and for consumers so i am happy that microsoft did not succeed in acquiring yahoo
795869 yahoo has actively participated in these human rights abuses including the censorship of information and in one case turning over information to the chinese government
795870 i believe you are moral but the only morality you believe in is profit and self interest
795871 he is as some would say a good guy despite the bad things written about him we look forward to him being a productive member of the board
795872 you have to think about whats going to be good for the company in the longer term microsoft has swallowed a lot of companies but im not sure their products are better

795875 this spectacular collection also gives visitors the opportunity to explore the power majesty and sophistication of an ancient civilization that was little understood until it was rediscovered by archeologists less than two centuries ago
795876 the reliefs from nineveh and nimrud are a visual encyclopedia of ancient mesopotamia one of the cradles of civilization
795877 today we are particularly aware how vulnerable these archaeological sites are in iraq and we can appreciate better than ever the efforts of archaeologists and museums past and present to preserve this part of the worlds heritage

795879 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage brett will be in camp tomorrow although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it
795880 that might not end the packers dilemma but favre would certainly look a whole lot better in the eyes of the public right now he is coming off as both a liar and money hungry as someone who may have concocted a hoax to benefit himself regardless of the consequences to the team and fans he professed love

795895 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
795896 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each

796135 can only be sold in herbal medicines following a one to one consultation with a practitioner
796136 its a close relative of deadly nightshade and is a very well recognised poisonous plant like most poisons it has medicinal properties it can be used to treat patients with pain affecting the urinary tubules such as kidney stones and for certain gut problems it acts as a sedative with analgesic properties
796137 a good portion would probably cause significant gastrointestinal diffculties and a larger dose would be fatal if anyone has followed mr worrall thompsons advice they should dial 999 and prepare to have their stomach pumped

796152 the researchers also found higher levels of psychological problems and health complaints in students who only reported eating problems in one of the two surveys
796153 our study backs up previous research that shows that eating problems often fluctuate in children of this age and in 50 to 60 percent of cases last about one to two years
796154 however in ten per cent of cases their eating problems can persist into adulthood
796155 although almost a fifth of the students who took part in our study reported eating problems at some point these problems clearly sorted themselves out in the majority of cases however one in twenty students continued to report problems
796156 we believe that our results point to the need for schools to screen adolescents with psychological problems or multiple health complaints for eating problems as these are the two key predictive factors that emerged from our study

796188 so smiths system teaches us that it is permissible for a great conductor to poison the happiness of individuals to afflict and mortify the individual to disregard the conservation and prosperity of any private individual to inspire in us a respectful affection for brutal tyrants and esteem for the noble military exploits of even very worthless characters and to sacrifice individuals little systems to the prosperity of a greater system all in the putative interest of society of the whole

796236 formed in 2001 when eating disorders awareness amp prevention edap joined forces with the american anorexia bulimia association aaba merging the largest and longest standing eating disorders prevention and advocacy organizations in the world the merger was the most recent in a series of alliances that has also included the national eating disorder organization nedo and the anorexia nervosa amp related disorders anred

796243 referenced eeg guided medication predictions in treatment refractory eating disorder patients
796244 despite the small sample size of this study the results support the promise of reeg as an effective tool for determining medication programs for treatment refractory patients with eating disorders and depression the decrease in depressive symptoms as well as significant improvement in eating disorders symptoms and weight for the eight patients in the trial was striking considering that prior to the study each had required either partial hospitalization or inpatient care as determined by managed behavioral health care reviewers however following reeg medication recommendations hospitalization days for the patients decreased dramatically anorexia nervosa is a potentially fatal illness with significant mortality if early interventions are not successful improved pharmacology as these cases demonstrate could decrease the high morbidity and mortality in patients with disordered eating
796245 the two bulimia nervosa patients in the study had seven hospitalizations between them but neither required further hospital care after being treated by the reeg guided medications personalized to their own brain function we would never have known or even considered these medications without the guidance of this reeg analysis and associated reports
796246 though a small group of patients were involved in this study considering the quality of the study the established treatment history prior to reeg analysis the durability of treatment response demonstrated over the 6 to 24 months following the reeg guided medication selection the severity of illness present in these patients with both eating disorders and depression and the consistent degree of benefit realized by these patients we are encouraged that such treatment resistant patients their families and their physicians can hope for a truly personalized medicine approach we are proud to recognize dr greenblatts disciplined commitment to this effort and look forward to his report on an additional group of patients that have not yet reached the six months response mark
796247 this is the second scientific poster to report on the benefit of reeg guided personalized medicine for the eating disordered population the previous poster reported on results in a residential care setting where 61 of 81 75 had been successfully treated with reeg guided medication selection i expect psychiatrists treating such challenging cases will appreciate dr greenblatts efforts concerning an even more severely disabled patient group this is a population for which there are essentially no known medication treatments other than fluoxetine for bulimia yet represents one of the most lethal groups we treat

796410 i think it has very important implications for how grief is conceptualized and how it is treated
796411 this shows that theres actually a difference in the brains of people who have the syndrome compared to the ones who dont
796412 some people are still confused by the fact that it does resemble regular grief
796413 i wanted to know if there is something different in the brain when people are processing their grief in those who are adapting well and those who are not adapting well
796414 the question was are their brains processing their grief differently
796415 moose were dropping dead of starvation right in front of park visitors
796416 it is the first time i can think of where we have foreign aid treating a chronic disease
796417 its a challenge to take this on i think the questions it raises are going to be important ones for the future

796430 dont let the other side scare you from what you know in your gut you know in your gut we have to bring about change
796431 people all over the state need to have a sense that a candidate cares about them and if you dont bother to show up in rural missouri if you dont bother to ask for peoples votes all over the state then youre not going to win statewide in missouri
796432 southwest missourians are much more focused on substance at the end of the day than style
796433 no question he has style he gives a great speech but theres a reason missouri has been called for years the show me state
796434 call back thursday or friday and i should give you a more definitive answer
796435 what rural missourians dont like is a candidate who dismisses whole communities out of hand

796453 there is a feeling that sir ian did everything right up to the point he made people aware that he was an acquaintance of one of the men bidding for contracts
796454 but at that point he should have stood down from the committee that decided the contract awards not continued to serve on it
796455 there is concern over the politicisation of the office of commissioner and that is disappointing
796456 he will be issuing proceedings within the next two weeks setting out in detail specific allegations which the mps metropolitan police service will have to consider
796457 sir ian now faces three very difficult issues tarique ghaffur jean charles de menezes and the contracts row i dont think any one of them was a knock out punch but i think the accumulation of the three
796458 i think too that people are polite when they call it an investigation into the contract at the end of the day this is an investigation into alleged corruption
796459 a dozing bumblebee lopes out from flopping foxgloves as she falls dress hoisted up around her bony hips back into the dry grass at the foot of the apple tree its boughs bow and curtsey arching into a parasols ribcage around them with a flood of wind that reveals her the boys palms arc back the ever so slightly sun kissed skin stretching over the underside of his knuckles the sun streams through his tendons and illuminates his blue veins and the scar from a match on his palm he loses himself eyes wide and marble like watching the shadows projected play and fold over her jawline before dipping down over her chestbone and rippling down over her bare breast bone fawn like strewn and fallen she lays as silently he devours the delicious picture before him the darting ladybird intent on reaching the top of her thighs the pink foxglove bulbs flickering in and out of his shade and the grass being brushed and folded over as she uncrosses and opens her legs

796488 where the poet does his job by virtue of an effort of the mind he is in rapport with the painter who does his job with respect to the problems of form and colour

796525 lets be clear the administrations cuts will seriously hurt the most vulnerable the terminally ill
796526 by issuing this rule cms is taking an end run around congress and its longstanding role protecting hospice
796527 the governments reason for its decision that would effectively cut rates the need to save money simply isnt true
796528 research has shown that hospice saves the medicare system money is highly rated by family members of hospice patients and enables the patient to die at home in most cases
796529 this rule defies logic and will have a direct negative impact on care at the bedside

796535 aba is an intervention therapy that takes simple behaviours that children cannot learn and breaks them into steps like making toast or washing hands
796536 the ministry of education always turns a deaf ear when it comes to aba
796537 every child is entitled to learn we as parents are doing our part by sending him to school and he should be taught even if he learns differently
796538 children with autism are very visual and find it easier to communicate by drawing pictures and what they see
796539 the schools are trying but they are only given a certain amount by the ministry
796540 its a good opportunity to tell people that we have good pies too
796541 so it was with me i had actually seen a light and in the midst of that light i saw two personages and they did in reality speak to me and though i was hated and persecuted for saying that i had seen a vision yet it was true and while they were persecuting me reviling me and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying i was led to say in my heart why persecute me for telling the truth i have actually seen a vision and who am i that i can withstand god or why does the world think to make me deny what i have actually seen for i had seen a vision i knew it and i knew that god knew it and i could not deny it neither dared i do it at least i knew that by so doing i would offend god and come under condemnation
796542 and when ye shall receive these things i would exhort you that ye would ask god the eternal father in the name of christ if these things are not true and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in christ he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the holy ghost

796614 by 2048 all american adults would become overweight or obese the results of the study show clearly how the future situation might become if current trends continue
796615 it will never come to pass that all americans are overweight not even in 2048
796616 however the other prediction of 86 percent by 2030 could very well happen
796617 the highest national interest is the eu membership and we will not give it up but this does not mean that the government will agree to any blackmail
796618 if someone thinks that this pro european government will give up on defending national interests for the sake of european perspectives they are wrong
796619 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
796620 and theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
796621 what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate a different kind of leader a person who has come to washington with a different agenda of someone who really does want to be a vehicle for change
796622 the repair of 15 aircraft that we have done almost twice as many flights improved status of the members of the army material and otherwise are the results that we can be proud of in the space of a year
796623 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats a very low probability and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse
796624 highly proactive in doing whatever is sensible to address our economic issues
796625 we had 13 specific audits in qantas engineering last year so we just see this as more of them casa doing their job which is to be the regulator
796626 what theyre doing i think is coming in and doing their job which is to make sure people have utter confidence in the safety of qantas but also the probity of the regulatory system
796627 casa audited qantas generally and qantas engineering specifically a great deal
796628 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
796629 firstly our aircraft travel around the globe how you avoid having them touched by foreign hands while you do that is a mystery to me
796630 but the second thing we have 7000 engineers employed in australia two thousand of those are doing heavy maintenance
796631 so that means the vast majority and i mean the vast majority of our work is actually done here in australia and has been for many many years and will continue to be
796632 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
796633 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
796634 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
796635 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
796636 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
796637 if you cant take the heat then get the f uck out the kitchen
796638 one day in your courts is better then a thousand
796639 yes but we live in a house that is in sad need of repair and we dont have the money to fix it
796640 she had no criminal history nor did she have any known personal reasons to run away from home she left a hot meal uneaten on the table and did not take any possessions with her
796641 it is as though she simply disappeared off the face of the earth
796642 there are people within the government who are reluctant to incorporate what is seen as a majority sunni armed force into the police or into the army but i dont think they have any choice
796643 there are about 5 6 million people between 45 and 65 years of age and less than a million of those have a secure future in terms of their superannuation and their health funding
796644 but also quite a few of them now recognise that superannuation isnt going to provide them the financial platform that they need when they retire
796645 in terms of thinking about other sources of funding to fund old age including health you know some said well well probably rely on the state or potentially on family or indeed personal assets
796646 the traditional approaches to dealing with old age and health care which is basically to try and support people in their homes but then move them into various institutions just wont work anymore
796647 and then of course youve got the ever increasing costs of health care and the fact that people are living longer and are therefore going to need more serious care for much longer
796648 none of that i think has been adequately addressed and to be honest the healthcare system is struggling even today to manage todays issues let alone thinking 20 years ahead
796649 unfortunately im in an industry where diversity is not celebrated the way it should be when some people see and hear something different it feels foreign to them and they dont like that everyone has a choice of what they like and thats a beautiful thing but record labels managers publicist journalist media etc have a tendency to see something work and try to reciprocate that with another artist thinking thats what makes success to me what makes success is letting people be truly who they are when i heard kanyes everything i am i instantly fell in love i felt my story somewhere in his i felt his frustration yet acceptance of who he was so i decided to put my own little twist on it
796650 youll receive a denial notice in the mail either today or tomorrow
796651 all i can say is there was no sense in planting that corn if thats all you were going to plant whats the point
796652 well would you look at this i bought a ham and turkey sandwich and they didnt even put any ham in it to speak of thats cause theyre cheap thats what they are ham costs more then turkey so they put a tiny slice of ham in to say its ham and turkey when really it aint nothin but turkey
796653 i cant wait until im 15 because then im almost old enough to learn to drive
796654 no you aint drivin when youre 16 you gotta wait until youre 20 at least all those teenagers out there drivin around killin everybody youre not going to be one of them i tell you what when you learn to drive you will learn in a graveyard thats where youll learn everyone there is already dead so you cant go killin anybody there and if you kill yourself well youre already in the graveyard so well just dig a hole and plop you in it
796655 we are having an unexpected staffing shortage in covering the olympics and he needs experienced journalists who can write and or shoot video to work on a freelance basis for cnn in beijing

796657 of all local media companies yellow pages publishers have been the most successful in moving toward digital sales averaging about 14 percent of their gross revenues from online sales this year by contrast the online contribution for most local newspaper radio cable and tv competitors is less than 5 percent of gross revenues
796658 yellow pages publishers have spent the past three years transforming their massive on the ground sales forces into marketing consultants who can meet their customers demands both in print and online

796662 n o foi desespero foi uma op o t tica ele alto e num lance poderia ganhar a primeira bola
796663 foi uma situa o de desespero em que precis vamos fazer o gol de qualquer maneira

796667 a equipe do gr mio joga sempre no limite se n o jogar assim n o o gr mio o campeonato ainda est aberto o time est se mantendo mas tem encontrado dificuldades

796669 quando o souza entrou ele fez certinho o que eu esperava dele fez a pir mide ao lado do tcheco encostando no reinaldo e numa sa da qualificada fizemos o gol
796670 pode jogar com o tcheco sim n o estou dizendo que o que vai acontecer mas uma alternativa bem plaus vel
796671 while this decision represents business challenges unique to the australian market it in no way reflects the strong state of starbucks business in countries outside of the united states
796672 there are no other international markets that need to be addressed in this manner
796673 we are well into the implementation phase of transforming starbucks and we believe that this difficult yet necessary decision to close stores in australia will help support the continued growth of our international business
796674 im really grateful for dana white they blew it up and now everyone recognizes me i wish the fight would have went a little longer so i could have tested him and tested my skills but im happy with it either way
796675 wow that will be past his bed time i hope that he is still happy
796676 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
796677 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
796678 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
796679 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
796680 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
796681 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
796682 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
796683 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
796684 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
796685 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
796686 the primary focus is the safety of the detainees as well as the detainee guard force and thats why we have this intelligence activity
796687 guantanamo has become little more than a holding center for hundreds of men most of whom will never be charged with a crime and have nothing to offer the u s government in the way of actionable intelligence
796688 you always want to make sure you understand the mood of the camp
796689 if i see a change in behavior my question then will be well is this because of a new procedure ive implemented or is this just because its hot outside or ive got a new rotation of detainee guards
796690 confirms what professional interrogators have been saying for years that captured terrorism suspects provide no useful intelligence after the first six months of detention
796691 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
796692 mel oliver come in cap youre crossing the bottom of a ship coming at you
796693 we just took his tow the barge is right in front of us and were running it over
796694 why didnt i think about conserving the billions of gallons of one of our most valued natural resources there is drinking water why because it was and still is insignificant in cost and i had control of the spigot not a person questioning it either
796695 there is only one basic human right the right to do as you damn well please and with it comes the only basic human duty the duty to take the consequences
796696 youll have all the amenities that you would expect at any u s based or european based resort
796697 once youre there you wont want to leave because youll have things so good there you wont believe
796698 you dont have access to the typical machinery manpower knowledge that you would in the states
796699 i believe passionately that african americans have a responsibility to support liberia much like jewish americans support israel
796700 given the long historical relationship between our two countries we have a special responsibility to do whatever we can to ensure that president sirleaf succeeds in her effort to rebuild the country there is a window of opportunity and we have to be sure that the opportunity is realized
796701 john mccains campaign makes an ad which ostensibly makes fun of paris hilton and britney spears while comparing obama to them but paris mom isnt happy
796702 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
796703 this is my favorite race track and by far the biggest win of my career ever since the first time i came here a few years ago i enjoyed coming here to pocono and when you look back at some of the names who have won at this place its a huge shot in the arm
796704 here in the spring we felt like we had the car to beat but we had a transmission break and that was really unfortunate
796705 scott got a run on me coming out of turn one and i knew we were still ahead of him but there was no way i was going to hold off that run i was numerous because i knew he had a really good car and thats the reason hes been winning a lot of these races
796706 on the last restart i knew i just had to get the best start i could and go out and focus 110 on hitting my mark and thats just what i did
796707 we raced each other really hard today and i think it was a really good race we both were on the same wave length we both needed to finish this race to have either a victory or a good finish scotts looking at the big picture and im sure this really helped him in points
796708 my hats off to justin he ran a great race and he was tough the whole race
796709 the timing lets say a month ago would have been different for bush to come
796710 it is not only playing into the domestic political processes but to possibly even be utilized politically in a very unproductive manner it is purely domestic politics it happens anywhere in the world
796711 he has a lot on the line and we are getting to the very difficult period on the issue of verification of the declaration the north koreans have provided on their nuclear program
796712 our message is the united states believes in democracy and freedom
796713 when the bush administration pays attention to southeast asia its about burma so the us foreign policy has really not fully engaged in the region
796714 i think it would be good for these athletes who have worked hard to see their president waving that flag
796715 the president simply cant go as a human being enjoying sports the president goes with the full weight and prestige of the united states when he sits at the opening ceremonies and sees the celebration of china
796716 he said he was going immediately so it was much more difficult for him to backtrack from that without seeming to humiliate or embarrass the chinese people in some way
796717 im fired up to go i cant wait to salute our athletes and i cant wait to share in the joy of your triumphs
796718 i should call off but theres only three hours for the booker to find a replacement shes nice and i dont want to cause her trouble and there might only be one other dancer scheduled and that would suck for her to get stuck like that
796719 i dont normally go to strip clubs but i would like to get to know you better outside of the work environment so heres the part where i ask you out
796720 ah they want me to come back so theyre trying to establish a good customer service relationship

796736 they were infected they had that bird flu thing the new government here and the un have agreed to destroy all carriers no matter the age or sex of the infected its getting bad my young friend i just pray this bus is not on the way to those camps
796737 rest easy old timer the un doctor told us our tests came back negative im sure we would all be dead if that were the case now
796738 okay you traitorous pieces of crap welcome to the united nations and united states marine corp repatriation processing center if you think escaping our shores and running will be that easy next time think again women are to assemble in the line over here men over there any disobedience and you will be shot on sight

796830 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
796831 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
796832 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species
796833 they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
796834 elephants are also a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries

796837 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are killed
796838 reminiscent of benito mu advertisement ssolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
796839 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
796840 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
796841 this ruling is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it
796842 i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
796843 slavery or ensuring that somebody is kept in conditions close to slavery
796844 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
796845 there were rumours of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
796846 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine
796847 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
796848 there were too many rumours we tried our best to keep things under control but it got out of hand
796849 on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
796850 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
796851 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
796852 given the evidence that china has failed to meet the solemn commitments it gave i believe it is now clear that awarding the olympic games to china was a mistake chinas recent behaviour is a humiliation for the international olympic committee and a salutary reminder to all politicians of the intransigence of the chinese over human rights and the status of tibet
796853 it was an ugly scene with blood everywhere i could not co advertisement unt the dead i just ran for my life
796854 we have now collected the pieces of nine dead women and still there are other parts scattered a minibus full of seriously injured women was rushed to hospital
796855 we received 46 injured including two men most of them serious the two men and two other women died in the emergency room
796856 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them our liaison officer at the base camp confirmed the death of five
796857 we dont have names of dead climbers but it has been confirmed that one dutch one norwegian and one french are in the tally of dead
796858 so what are they going to do with all the statues of naked women scattered in museums throughout italy with busts that would take pamela andersons breath away
796859 i hope that whoever came up with this absurd mad pathetic comic and futile idea was acting without the knowledge of the prime minister maybe they wanted to do him a favour by not letting italians associate a breast with his image but if anything it has done the opposite
796860 it is not good to offend tiepolo the author of this grotesque and absurd gesture should be punished as they have offended a particular artist
796861 the prime ministers office has managed to offend one of the great artists of liberty
796862 the decision was taken to cover up the exposed breast for fear of offending the sensibilities of people watching press conferences
796863 perhaps the prime ministers staff feared that the attention of journalists was being drawn to the breast over his left shoulder rather than to what he was saying

796875 many people think that we process what happens to us and make our decisions with our mind when in fact we process energy and information through a subtle energy field called an aura this energy field surrounds and penetrates us and is tremendously sensitive to the energetics of personal interaction and the situations that develop in our lives it is also the key to making good decisions through this map we can see how your personal authority functions and provide a strategy through which you can honor your own way of making decisions
796876 the aura is regulated through an endocrine messaging system which regulates the energetic circuits in our bodies

796913 as countless fact checkers and tsk tskers have maintained the broadsides were a blend of distortion innuendo and outright slander but that doesnt mean they and their inevitable successors wont prove effective especially against an opponent with so little experience under ruthless and relentless fire before obama hurled himself into the presidential scrum hed never been hit with a negative ad a point often raised by hillary clintons people and though they made sure obama lost his negative spot virginity the ads they ran against him were patty cake compared with what he faces now hence the questions on which the general election may turn will obama be capable of withstanding the pummeling the mccain forces have begun to unleash or as hillary privately predicted will he crumple like a paper doll
796914 the alternative of course is to get on offense to batter mccain for his gaffes and incoherence hammer him for his flip flops highlight how his maverick status is a thing of the past and turn him into a combination of bush and grandpa simpson god knows there are those in chicago champing at the bit to do just that not least one imagines obamas chief strategist david axelrod who can wield the cudgel of negative ads with as much vigor and glee as any republican yet obama seems reluctant to go there tough pol though he is hes a conciliator and not a confrontationalist at heart he seems to believe that once undecided voters know him better he will have them eating along with so many others out of the palm of his hand

796919 6 800 minority journalists gave a standing ovation to obama even though they were told not to
796920 one of the minority journalists in attendance said it was appropriate for journalists of color to
796921 it would be a smart move by mccain to restrict the access of black reporters theyre all voting for obama out of racial solidarity so what does the mccain camp have to gain by allowing black reporters access the nominee black reporters arent going to be objective so allowing them access can only cause damage

796931 there is no evidence that king himself was a member of the cpusa or that he was a rigorous adherent of marxist ideology or of the communist party line
796932 also there were other reporters who were asked to leave

796962 the risk with any metric is that people will come to see it as a description of a reality rather than as a tool for a conversation about that reality
796963 most projects developed under ji requires a higher price compared to a similar project developed under cdm due to shorter crediting period a un approved timespan during which projects can earn credits which is five years for ji while seven 10 years for cdm will carbon buyers pay the price given the intense competition from cdm and the increased risks of ji the answer is so far no
796964 the further we proceed towards 2012 the developers will ask for a higher price for credits
796965 generally higher price expectations than for cdm and many promising projects require project finance skills and available equity from the project investor contract signing often equals a money down business culture or prepayments
796966 but buyers will be unwilling to pay more because there are so many additional risks to doing ji projects compared with the cdm he said
796967 as with cers prices of primary erus will differ depending on the project the country the developer and so on however guaranteed delivered erus should be at parity with guaranteed cers there is little fundamental justification for any difference
796968 if a ji project is approved by a host country and the seller has a lower level of counterparty risk then the prices paid could be higher than 11
796969 given that it takes 563 days on average between validation of a project and the first issuance if you start a project at the end of 2010 or early 2011 then you might not get your credits until 2013 after which the kyoto compliance period will have expired
796970 some projects register first then they commission equipment and build the project which obviously takes time for example a hydropower project takes three years to build on average and many such projects have not started building process when registering
796971 what is probably more of an issue to the market as a whole is the time it takes to get projects registered
796972 why do they choose to stack their papers on their desks

797090 underlying these reforms however is capital misallocation by the system nonperforming loans are the most conspicuous outcome of this misallocation but our research shows that the much larger volume of loans to underperforming ventures that dont go bad but yield only negligible returns are potentially more costly to chinas economy
797091 summing all of these figures we come up with total official nonperforming loans of us 206 bn and other estimated problem loans of over us 270 bn in the banking system we would reiterate however that a large portion of this latter figure is comprised of estimated special mention loans or loans that currently are not classified as nonperforming emphasis fitchs at the same time there is an additional us 197 bn in npl carveouts still remaining on the balance sheets of chinas asset management companies which no longer represent direct losses for banks but are a future liability for the government
797092 beyond this estimating a rate of flow of new nonperforming loans is not an easy exercise given chinese banks extremely weak historical data and ongoing deficiencies in accounting and disclosure few banks report data on npl flows and those that do show recent flow rates in the extremely low single digits we believe these numbers understate the likely level of ultimate credit losses given what we know to be the slow evolution of a strong credit culture and risk management practices and our suspicion that chinas over reliance on investment led growth comes at a cost to bank credit quality
797093 given the weaknesses already discussed we believe chinese banks remain acutely vulnerable to an economic slowdown although the analysis above recognizes that much work has been done to tackle these weaknesses and at a minimum suggests that chinese banks and the government are more equipped today than in the past to deal with problems that may arise

797187 your next laptop could have a continuous power battery that lasts for 30 years without a single recharge thanks to work being funded by the u s air force research laboratory the breakthrough betavoltaic power cells are constructed from semiconductors and use radioisotopes as the energy source as the radioactive material decays it emits beta particles that transform into electric power capable of fueling an electrical device like a laptop for years
797188 although betavoltaic batteries sound nuclear theyre not they neither use fission fusion or chemical processes to produce energy and so do not produce any radioactive or hazardous waste betavoltaics generate power when an electron strikes a particular interface between two layers of material the process uses beta electron emissions that occur when a neutron decays into a proton which causes a forward bias in the semiconductor this makes the betavoltaic cell a forward bias diode of sorts similar in some respects to a photovoltaic solar cell electrons scatter out of their normal orbits in the semiconductor and into the circuit creating a usable electric current the profile of the batteries can be quite small and thin a porous silicon material is used to collect the hydrogen isotope tritium which is generated in the process the reaction is non thermal which means laptops and other small devices like mobile phones will run much cooler than with traditional lithium ion power batteries the reason the battery lasts so long is that neutron beta decay into protons is the worlds most concentrated source of electricity truly demonstrating einsteins theory e mc2 the best part about these cells are when they eventually run out of power they are totally inert and non toxic so environmentalists need not fear these high tech scientific wonder batteries if all goes well plans are for these cells to reach store shelves in about 2 to 3 years

797209 there have been some disturbing signs for instance this morning i put two quarters in the office vending machine and i got a house worst of all the downturn is hitting starbucks right in the fresh roast beans
797210 first the coffee giant announced it was closing 600 stores reducing its locations to merely everywhere and now starbucks has announced that it is cutting 1 000 jobs from its work force which means 1 000 people leaving starbucks to return to their previous careers of playing guitar outside of starbucks
797211 i just hope this doesnt affect the starbucks under my desk because it is just so efficient to have

797336 he didnt want to go he was afraid but he had a job that hed signed up to do and he went and did it
797337 i do think it led up to everything that happened it opened up a world of death and chaos and uncertainty
797338 my wife and friends they tell me im not the same person before i came back not as loving
797339 you really realize how insignificant you are in this world and life moves on whether youre there or not
797340 the children of these families are suffering damage emotionally and a lot of them arent getting any help
797341 were going to have fallout from this for a long time
797342 we see a lot of things that are going on in the war which do contribute mainly the longtime and multiple deployments away from home exposure to really terrifying and horrifying things the easy availability of loaded weapons right now
797343 and so all of those together we think are part of what may contribute especially if somebodys having difficulties already
797344 there is no single joint tracking system capable of monitoring suicides mental health evacuations and use of mental health and combat stress services
797345 as a nation our mental health capability is not adequate to the need
797346 youre tough and you go into the hospital when you receive a physical wound
797347 that doesnt mean youre weak in some way and so why wouldnt you when youve received a psychological wound its the same difference theyre all wounded
797348 expect a private or a specialist to be willing to seek counseling when his or her captain or colonel or general wont do it
797349 they are doing some amazing things here in terms of helping soldiers who want to remain soldiers but who have been wounded with post traumatic stress disorder
797350 it is a multi month effort by a lot of caring people and they are showing some real success in restoring these soldiers
797351 the second and in some ways equally challenging is to remove the stigma that is associated with ptsd and to encourage soldiers sailors marines and airmen who encounter these problems to seek help
797352 for far too long and for far too many this question has been an obstacle to care
797353 it took longer than i would have hoped but it is done
797354 now it is clear to people who answer that question that they can answer no if they have sought help to deal with their combat stress in general times
797355 strictly related to adjustments from service in a military combat environment
797356 seeking professional care for these mental health issues should not be perceived to jeopardize an individuals security clearance
797357 failure to seek care actually increases the likelihood that psychological stress could escalate to a more serious mental condition which could preclude an individual from performing sensitive duties
797358 the most important thing for us now is to get the word out as far as we can to every man and woman in uniform to let them know about the change to let them know the efforts under way to remove the stigma and to encourage them to seek help when they are in the theater or when they return from the theater
797359 we have no higher priority in the department of defense apart from the war itself than taking care of our men and women in uniform who have been wounded who have both visible and unseen wounds
797360 this center here is illustrative of what can be done
797361 i dont think people should get the purple heart for almost getting wounded
797362 these guys have paid at least a high as high a price some of them as anybody with a traumatic brain injury as anybody with shrapnel wound and what it does is it says this is the wound that isnt worthy and i say it is
797363 the purple heart was set up for combat wounds for those who have shed blood and i believe that although ptsd is a physical disease and is an injury it does not qualify for the merit of purple heart based on that
797364 it takes the courage and strength of a warrior to ask for help
797365 ive been very worried about stop loss ever since i got here and found out what it was
797366 i sent the army a memo a year ago this spring asking for their plan to reduce stop loss unfortunately my decision to go to 15 month tours just made it impossible for them to achieve that
797367 we will be spending millions of dollars related to auditing procedures
797368 if those millions of dollars resulted in the saving of one veterans life wouldnt they be worthwhile
797369 i think we have to make tough judgments in the industry on how to best measure success
797370 nothing more than an empty promise on which too many veterans have tragically learned they cannot rely
797371 i dont want to give cbs any more numbers on veterans suicides or attempts than they already have it will only lead to more questions
797372 is this something we should carefully address ourselves in some sort of release before someone stumbles on it
797373 i dont know how any veteran can stand it and stick with it and get to the end of this process
797374 it cannot all be done immediately like plaintiffs seem to think
797375 this center here is illustrative of what can be done
797376 spiritual ministry transcendental meditation yoga bioenergies such as qi gong reiki and distant healing
797377 unfortunately you cant package john fortunato and move him around and it really takes someone with that passion to drive these kinds of operations
797378 but there are some of the elements of this that are clearly exportable and we will do that
797379 there were two things about that that didnt seem right
797380 i got tired of soldiers crying in my office telling me they did not want to get out that the army was their life and thats all they knew and all i could say is sorry we have to discharge you it tore me up
797381 i thought that is not true because we havent really tried hard enough to rehabilitate them there were so many issues we were not addressing
797382 so i had to sort of seduce them out of their rooms
797383 you can sense the music playing which is based on breathing and if you spend three minutes in this room with the door shut without anyone talking you you will find that your mental state has changed
797384 so there is a lot of traffic in and out of this room
797385 you will sometimes find four soldiers just sitting here and we want them to do that
797386 and let me say that regardless of what your faith is there is always something that makes our life meaningful
797387 we all have some notion about why relationships are important and who we are all those issues are questioned by soldiers in war they come home and they have to deal with questions they usually dont have the ability to handle and im not offering any particular answers but god have mercy we have to help soldiers answer those questions so that they can get on with their lives
797388 in theater if you lose a buddy here is what you do drink water stuff it down and go back out on the road
797389 because you dont have time to grieve and that is what a soldier has to do but when you come back and you have done that for a whole year you have a load of grief you havent done
797390 in order to stay alive their bodies have been hyper aroused for so long that they come back and cannot turn it off
797391 their body doesnt even remember how to relax again and because of that they dont sleep and are irritable
797392 you would think that going to the mall would be fun but it is not fun for a post deployment soldier
797393 there are too many people too much noise which sets them up for panic attacks but we cant leave them there so we teach them relaxation techniques to modulate stress and we take them to the mall
797394 but we have to challenge them if they want to stand up and be warriors again
797395 we are in the process of doing a research protocol with 400 soldiers
797396 wbamc is considering that research protocol and if we can show that it is true then we move to the next step the army is very interested in doing the best thing for the soldier and if we find thats what we need to do then we will do it
797397 it is like a muscle you have to work it to make it better
797398 fulfills the commitment that america made in 1944 and has continued to honor every generation of veterans since world war ii
797399 we have no issue with the fact that it is generous we think our troops deserve to be rewarded for their service
797400 we are not trying to keep people here forever but we are trying to create a system in which troops see the benefit of making a career out of the military
797401 in a way that does not jeopardize our national security
797402 i think it would a politically devastating mistake if the president were to veto it
797403 the gi bill is what actually took our family to the middle class
797404 you can do some networking and make some more contacts instead of just jumping back into an area youve been away from for a long time
797405 there was some wording in a letter that i received a couple of days ago from senator mccain saying that they wanted to work with us to bring a bipartisan bill
797406 hes trying to bring his version of the gi bill to a vote on the senate floor so that he can say that he at least tried or at least those who vote his way have some cover
797407 the only way the only way that sen graham could protect his rights was to bring the amendment forward at this time
797408 there has been a pilot program available in current law since 2001 for the united states military to test the transferability program if the service secretaries decided that they wanted to try it
797409 my job is to get people to stay in the military not only to join but to stay as well
797410 i would prefer to call it the thank you bill
797411 ensure that service to our nation does not disadvantage those who serve
797412 the act of donning a military uniform is a deeply symbolic act it always has been and it likely always will be it is an act that experiences a deep and selfless commitment to the idea we call america when ordinary men and women step into the uniform of this nation they commit themselves to the performance of an extraordinary duty which may entail the highest and most fearsome call
797413 every man is a hero and an oracle to somebody
797414 altogether since 2003 there have been seven homicides and three suicides on western washington soil involving active troops or veterans of iraq five wives a girlfriend and one child have been slain four other children have lost one or both parents to death or imprisonment three service members have committed suicide two of them after killing their wife or girlfriend no one can say if the killing can be directly connected to the psychological effects of war but most involve a risk factor distinctive to the military armed men trained to kill and some killers carry the invisible scars of war
797415 well youre one of us now youve just survived your first ied improvised explosive device attack
797416 i dont know for certain but shes a hero in my mind
797417 given that we are having more and more compensation seeking veterans id like to suggest that you refrain from giving a diagnosis of ptsd straight out
797418 really dont have time to do the extensive testing that should be done to determine ptsd
797419 repudiated at the highest level of our health care organization
797420 vas leadership will strongly remind all medical staff that trust accuracy and transparency is paramount to maintaining our relationships with our veteran patients
797421 why is she saying this who is giving her the order
797422 were not aware of any other instances where this happened
797423 asking for all records pertaining to any guidance given the va regarding the diagnosis of ptsd
797424 should you come up positive for mental problems you could be forced to stay in iraq for three to four more months before you can go home
797425 if youre thinking about killing yourself dont be afraid to get some help
797426 the army is doing a lot more as far as trying to reach out and find soldiers who are having issues but are reluctant to seek mental health care due to the historical mental health stigma within the military
797427 respect mil tears down the walls concerning ptsd by making questions concerning ptsd and depression a routine activity any time someone visits their local primary health provider which offers soldiers and their family members extra chances to spot a problem early on
797428 we also try to make it clear to soldiers that seeking help is not going to adversely affect their careers or make anyone think any less of them
797429 a major part of the process for tearing down the walls is screening everybody that comes through demonstrating that it is ok if someone suffering from ptsd seeks help
797430 the macarthur initiative was intentionally designed not to be a research trial
797431 we were interested in dissemination and permanence from the start and we wanted users to incur minimal costs
797432 we learned about how the different processes of screening identifying and treatment of these disorders function under respect mil did some role play and had a rundown of the entire program
797433 we also learned how we can educate other primary care providers and psychiatrists in the respect mil system
797434 screening all soldiers and getting their doctors to talk to them about mental health
797435 the cycle of deployments that we are in has generated a lot more mental health problems in soldiers who might otherwise never have seen me
797436 the trials performed at the fort bragg center of excellence showed a significant increase in the successful diagnosing and treatment of soldiers with ptsd and depression
797437 supervision requires about two to five minutes per patient depending on patient acuity severity and past history of problems
797438 many patients dont need any changes in treatment plan or have major risk factors so these patients can be reviewed briefly
797439 we encourage adherence overcome barriers and monitor the response with accountable continuous follow up until remission
797440 when i talked to his family about derek i realized it was the same old story
797441 it was all too familiar he was taking those same drugs as the others and yes i believe they are still prescribing that combination
797442 you shouldnt put vulnerable mentally unstable people on drugs like that
797443 that was the biggest difference in his personality after he came back
797444 he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and he was struggling with it he was on eight different medications from what we have learned there was not much medical supervision on how he was to take the medications
797445 his marine friends have said that knowing chad and having fought by his side they dont believe he was capable of committing suicide our family feels the same way
797446 when he came home he said he did not want to go back
797447 last year he learned that he was being sent back he expressed again that he didnt want to go back he was told that he would follow orders or the alternative would be a dishonorable discharge so he went back to iraq
797448 at the age of 18 he had seen more horrors than i have ever seen in my life
797449 i dont know if i could hold someone in my arms that was badly wounded and watch him die or see dead bodies all around he really struggled with that after his first tour in iraq
797450 he was getting ready to get out marry his fianc e and go to school to become a firefighter and a paramedic
797451 i always thought that anyone in the military who has fought in a war is well taken care of if wounded physically or suffering with ptsd
797452 they give ptsd patients a bunch of pills wheres the counseling they need wheres the compassion for those who come home hurt after fighting for our freedoms its not right
797453 it upsets me to find out that in chads case and probably in many more cases the military gives these kids suffering from ptsd all this medication and does not monitor them its disgraceful
797454 accidental deaths we believe often as a consequence of the use of multiple prescription and nonprescription medicines and alcohol
797455 this isnt restricted to the military alone as we all saw the unfortunate death of one of our leading actors recently
797456 its not easy for soldiers to admit the problems that theyre having over there for a variety of reasons
797457 if they do admit it then the only solution given is pills
797458 the high percentage of u s soldiers attempting suicide after taking ssris should raise serious concerns
797459 and theres no question theyre using them to prop people up in difficult circumstances
797460 is it really in my interests to rip this guys lungs out is it really what i want to do
797461 felt like he had taken his first breath in four years
797462 good day i am a friend of a veteran who has ptsd and i am trying to get some information for him apparently he was prescribed risperdal for a few month he took risperdal until two months ago and then discontinued after one month he found out through sperm analysis that he sub fertile with a law count he is devastated as he wants to start having a family i am trying to find out whether it is reversible and whether he can restore his fertility his psychiatrist was of no help so he got a referral to a fertility expert the fertility expert told him to wait 4 months and then to test again his fertility he explain that it will take up to a month for the affect of risperdal to leave the body and further 3 months to create new sperm clean of the affect of risperdal my friend is anxious to know his chances to recover in my search for answers on the net i came across your web site and i wonder if you know of other veterans who were given risperdal discontinued and whether a few months later at least four months managed to recover i also would like to be a member as i would like to chat to other people and encouraging my friend to chat as well with other veterans thanks for your help
797463 risperdal should be used only when nothing else worked and there is no other choice

797481 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics

797519 playing well is always good but weve clinched a very important victory thanks to the effort of all the squad we didnt allow vitoria to play
797520 i had seen an article about a man who had lost his leg to sarcoma and was still doing marathons
797521 i thought about how grateful i was to still be able to participate in the race
797522 i was getting a little teary eyed and feeling sorry for myself that i will probably have to be a spectator this year instead of a participant
797523 during my quiet time though god showed me that out of fear or because of lack of time management or whatever reason many of us really dont participate in many areas of our lives we just let life and opportunities to touch others pass by
797524 it doesnt mention offshore drilling what it talks about it tries to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
797525 even you joe 10 years ago you went to the floor of the united states senate and you said that our public life is coarsening you said that the societys values are shrinking thats an ad that plays to the worst instincts in america which is to diminish someones character

797529 t mobile is arguing that american citizens dont deserve the use of their own spectrum because they overbuilt onto the next lot
797530 mobile is indeed a challenge and since we are part of cbs and linked to cbs mobile we are the only book publisher positioned to do a true multi platform play across mobile video on demand online and book retailers
797531 just yesterday a doctor i dont know that well stopped me in the cafeteria and asked me whatever happened to that iraqi boy and i made a mental note to find out
797532 everything would have been ok if i kept him here
797533 i dont know if he suffered but i hope he didnt he suffered enough
797534 but weve got to be cognisant if things happen we need to be flexible and pro active and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
797535 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues with qantas
797536 its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
797537 now it appears we have got to do the best job we can possibly do within a budget
797538 what we want to say is that lots of comments have been attributed to engineers about falling maintenance standards thats concerned our members
797539 he will also be restricted by sarbanes oxley on how he behaves and if we are really lucky he will be appointed to the audit committee and have the further burden of being a steward of the companys finances

797545 shopping behavior will noticeably change purchases will go down per capita this will due to belt tightening but also due to the effect of the explosive growth that on line sales will now have on off line sales
797546 a month ago google accounted for 65 1 of all searches in the u s that compares to 58 3 18 months ago this means that the company has three times the market share of its nearest competitor yahoo and nine times the share of the distant third place finisher microsoft will google continue to be a the central player in the current zeitgeist at least for the next year it will be as it is making all the right moves facing the future
797547 the transformational changes that digitization and the internet have brought to music video and news reporting will now begin to affect the book publishing industry in a noticeable way the unstoppable process of disintermediation i have often presented in this space will now move to book publishing the two most noticeable areas will be in ebooks and in print on demand amazons launch of the kindle will be the beginning of a rapid upswing in the sale of ebooks albeit from a very small base
797548 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision

797551 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
797552 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump

797568 ich kam gerade aus nem heim f r schwererziehbare und meine mom schickte mich in eine christliche jugendgruppe ich ging eigentlich nur wegen der m dels hin aber als ich dort ankam haben sie da auch gerappt und ihre art hat mich total gepackt die leute waren so herzlich und nett begr ssten mich wie einen alten freund und so blieb ich nach weniger als 24 stunden habe ich selbst mein leben jesus anvertraut das war im november 1998 seitdem hat sich alles bei mir komplett ver ndert
797569 damals h tte ich nie gedacht dass das einmal zu meinem beruf werden w rde ich hatte einfach nur spass dabei
797570 als ich das erste mal in einem gottesdienst vor publikum auftrat war ich so nerv s dass ich den ganzen text vergessen habe
797571 ch wusste dass ich das talent und die begabung habe gott hat das in mich hineingelegt und dann muss man selbst los legen und gott hatte so viel mehr f r mich als ich je gedacht h tte
797572 es gab zeiten da habe ich nicht mehr an mich geglaubt ja ich habe auch schwierigkeiten aber ich habe einen gott kennengelernt der liebt und das hat mich ver ndert dieses licht das mir die dunkelheit genommen hat das will ich weiter geben es ist meine pflicht und ich hoffe ich schaffe das durch meine musik und vor allem durch die art wie ich lebe

797575 so put your faith in god and dont look back cause the past can stop your future if you let it
797576 setz dein vertrauen auf gott und schau nicht auf das was fr her war
797577 ich weiss wie die leute sich f hlen weil ich mich selbst manchmal verloren f hle aber durch jesus erkenne und verstehe ich dass da freiheit ist ich will nicht das menschen verloren gehen meine aufgabe ist es seelen zu retten

797610 declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work
797611 the cantarell oilfield in the shallow waters of the campeche bay is regarded in the mexican oil industry as the countrys crown jewel it is the worlds second largest oil field by production pumping about 2 2 million barrels of oil as much as every oil field in kuwait put together for that reason the news from petroleos mexicanos the state oil company that the fields production would begin to decline this year was met with dismay declining production from a field typically means the pressure the oil is under is falling so other fluids or gas must be pumped in to force what remains out of the ground making the work harder and more expensive the decline also ultimately leads to the point when although much of its oil may remain in place oil companies turn their back on the field as it has become too expensive to justify the work

797635 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
797636 the main achievement is that russia has revived its influence in the world

797640 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labor but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
797641 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
797642 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
797643 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
797644 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
797645 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him

797649 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes

797712 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
797713 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign

797869 xavier nady could be the former yankees third baseman scott brosius of this team just the study guy doesnt say much just gets the job done but demaso marte they really needed that addition they havent had a left handed in their bullpen really all season long
797870 in my opinion chone figgins is one of the most valuable players in this league he does everything for this angels and they are arguably the best team in baseball going from first to third they always are pushing the envelope
797871 of course starting pitchers ben sheets and cc sabathia when those two dont win in milwaukee they look very ordinary as a team
797872 bad play by abreu just amazing to me when you see a guy like bobby abreu that has that much experience in the game has seen it all done it all and occasionally has that bonehead kind of play no other way to describe it
797873 john maine their sturdy right hander whos had a solid season now is going to be put on the dl with shoulder stiffness soldier strain and billy wagner is going to have another mri his second in the last couple of weeks
797874 when you look at xavier nady he was a very popular player when he was with the mets a few seasons ago i think for ny yankees gm brain cashman when he goes to trade for players especially every day players it is always nice to know that they have played in new york had success in new york and was a popular player in new york even though it was for just a short time with the mets
797875 if this is a playoff preview ron darling boy have we had a great game to watch today
797876 what a great game almost like a boxing match toe to toe these teams going back and forth
797877 a nightmarish inning for chone figgins at third it should have been two a double play they got none yankees back in front
797878 theyve had a halo of a time finishing off the yankees today

797906 i get a good family feeling from them i like their coaches and the fact that they run a pro style offense that fits my body size i feel im more of a possession type receiver
797907 coach zook is a hard person to say no to the one negative is that its far away but in the end i will not let distance be a factor if i like the school
797908 i like their coaches i went to a camp there i spoke with several of their receivers i also liked their campus
797909 i like coach smith a lot he is very down to earth and easy to talk to i had a teammate go there for a camp and he said that coach smith stayed on top of the wr prospects at camp i like that
797910 coach galloway is a really funny guy hes down to earth and easy to talk to right now hes looking for players they need receivers to throw it to they think i can be a program changer for them
797911 theyve really stepped it up lately i like them a lot and they are recruiting me hard

solid rock with some being decorated with doric pillars put on your walking shoes and climbing pants and dont be afraid to get yourself a little dirty at this site fun to explore and full of some very atmospheric places 2 paphos mosaics cyprus history proclaims aion as the greek god of eternity the house of aion has an amazing five paneled mosaic which shows the greek god in the unenviable position of having to judge what appears to be a beauty contest unenviable i hear our modern day gods proclaim the difference in this beauty contest is that his choice lies between the ordinary and smug looking queen cassiopeia and a number of much prettier but unhappy looking nereides water nymphs im sure that all of you will be able to guess who the eventual winner is 3 aphrodites rock the most awe inspiring piece of coastline to be seen in cyprus when the sun is out and i defy any couple regardless of how young or old to not be bewitched by its spell of all ancient greek myths the story of aphrodites creation will bring water to your eyes but the story lives on as one of the well known legends surrounding this stunning rock formation cronos was begged by his mother gaia to be released from the embraces of her husband uranus in order to assist his mother in her plight cronos castrated his father with a sickle and threw his genitals into the sea the foam gathered around them and the goddess rose from the sea as a fully grown woman 4 st george fishing harbour i recommend that you visit this memorable place in paphos with someone very special to you and a camera arrive late afternoon and watch the fishing boats come in with their daily catch have a drink or two at the beach side bar but dont stay too long before securing yourself a spot on the harbour wall take along the camera or video and make sure you have plenty of film as this is one of those special places to catch the most romantic of sunsets in cyprus enjoy 5 sterna winery located on the outskirts of the village of kathiskas 15 mins drive from paphos be entertained by the charismatic cypriot owner who will treat you to free wine tasting and a tour of this very small winery do not miss out on their own

holiday and airport transfer getting a good deal on a ski transfer is part of that plan get out of debt credit card debt is a growing concern many people have credit cards and get into deep water with

797951 the traction that groundwork monitor is gaining in vertical markets such as financial services proves that the solution delivers great value for a wide range of enterprises
797952 the growth that open source systems management and groundwork in particular has seen in enterprise adoption indicates to me that the benefits that these solutions have over proprietary offerings are finally being realized and that the time is ripe for further adoption
797953 i am delighted that alan has joined the groundwork team the combination of his domain expertise in systems management and his deep multi channel distribution management experience is just whats needed to drive groundworks continuing rapid growth
797954 alan is expert at using web 2 0 marketing and sales techniques to drive mid enterprise sales to sustainable profitability
797955 the combination of carahsofts broad knowledge of government it needs and groundworks expertise in systems and network monitoring means that both technical and organizational challenges are well understood and addressed
797956 we believe that this webinar will provide deep and immediate value to those interested in learning more about it monitoring solutions for government agencies
797957 we use ganglia for both capacity planning and problem identification purposes
797958 we use ganglia to collect and record metrics on every host at flickr and it fits our architecture quite well we have the ability to write new metrics quickly and aggregate those across many clusters automatically
797959 ganglias wide spread adoption and its use in varied environments created significant demand for the new capabilities included in ganglia 3 1
797960 as an enterprise monitoring solution as well as an open source project adding a higher degree of flexibility that would support a broader set of monitored metrics seemed like the right thing to do to move the ganglia project to the next level
797961 ganglia is an important part of groundworks solution offerings and one of our most successful community partnerships the ganglia development team has created a highly scalable it monitoring tool thats allowed us to offer increased capacity and performance to our largest customers
797962 groundwork open source offers a ganglia integration module that enables groundwork monitor to provide multiple role status views dashboards reports notifications and configuration tools for data collected and displayed by ganglia some of our largest deployments use ganglia and groundwork monitor together in an integrated fashion to monitor over 10 000 servers in business critical environments

797978 okay great but how does anyone make money with open source
797979 nagios is really powerful and flexible but it has an arcane syntax and its a hassle to configure
797980 groundwork is open enough so that weve been able to integrate it with a lot of open source packages
797981 we use trending data in the data center to monitor things like temperature and humidity
797982 its not that helpful to know what the temperature is right now if you didnt know what its been like for 24 hours
797983 diverse open source it point solutions into an overarching consolidated view of their networks and systems while simultaneously increasing server admin ratio and maintaining to open source extensibility
797984 the biggest challenge in our university environment is being able to coordinate campus wide monitoring efforts while maintaining economies
797985 because of groundworks extensibility we are able to collaborate with multiple departments across campus and leverage the talent of other system administrators to gain central visibility into the health of our systems as we continue to increase our monitoring efforts we will be able to have a birds eye view of the university using groundwork monitor
797986 by open sourcing the core technology in our web and proxy server suns goal is to give developers more flexibility choice and help them achieve faster time to market
797987 through suns enterprise grade web software stack and suns web and proxy servers enterprises and developers now have the option to standardize their development and production environments on open source technology
797988 i am quite excited by the opportunities and possibilities that this provides both as an open source community member but also as a director member and developer within the apache software foundation

797993 everyone has their own song that they must sing everyone has a book in them to write everyone has a poem in them that must come out everyone has something unique that god has given to them the church has become the creatives worst enemy
797994 they meet he saves her she guesses what he is
797995 n one of those things which precede justification whether faith or works merit the grace of justification for if it is by grace it is not now by works otherwise as the apostle paul says grace is no more grace
797996 as waters flow from the mountains down into the valleys so too do gods graces flow into humble souls
797997 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which to look out christs compassion to the world yours are the feet with which he is to go about doing good yours are the hands with which he is to bless men now

797999 my daughter do you think you have written enough about my mercy what you have written is but a drop compared to the ocean i am love and mercy itself there is no misery that could be a match for my mercy neither will misery exhaust it because as it is being granted it increases the soul that trusts in my mercy is most fortunate because i myself take care of it

798001 oss is already a part of most higher education institutions and if its not chances are high that it is part of an institution that stakeholders such as researchers and students collaborate with
798002 some of the perceived drawbacks of close source software like licensing maintenance costs available support vendor lock in adaptability and pace of change has led to a high and increasing adoption rate of oss in higher education
798003 the biggest challenge in our university environment is being able to coordinate campus wide monitoring efforts while maintaining economies
798004 because of groundworks extensibility we are able to collaborate with multiple departments across campus and leverage the talent of other system administrators to gain central visibility into the health of our systems as we continue to increase our monitoring efforts we will be able to have a birds eye view of the university using groundwork monitor
798005 many of the open source sub components of groundwork had their beginnings in academia so it makes sense that theyd be a natural fit for university and research environments
798006 groundwork monitor then returns the benefit of a unified system and network management solution to academia allowing the focus to be upon teaching and research instead of infrastructure availability
798007 manufacturers generally view the midmarket as channel led which offers them the benefit of expanding their coverage model while lowering their selling costs
798008 it is a bit of a perfect storm in that it is not competitive with the manufacturers the volume of accounts is significant and there are strong financial incentives available to the channel partners from the vendors
798009 hp is by far our biggest partner and this is no way a slam against hp
798010 its simply our way of extending our market reach to areas hp software cant play in for whatever reasons whether they are too big too robust too complex or not cost effective
798011 with groundwork we have a low entry point it doesnt necessarily compete against hp because its business we werent going to necessarily win anyway
798012 our enterprise expertise allows us to provide more robust and effective solutions scaled to customers needs
798013 we have a definite advantage over those moving up the value chain in situations where experience and knowledge are important to the project
798014 we moved into omaha and thought that we could grow that area by organic growth but its been a slow and painful process
798015 our heritage has been totally in the small space what we are learning is that it requires us to change a whole bunch of things if we are really to be effective
798016 with the cost of people and cost of fuel moving people from location to location is a losing proposition
798017 last year we paid more than 350 million in partnerone rebates and we plan to do more in 2008
798018 the smb market in 2008 is a 72 billion opportunity and we need partners help to reach all of the buying points in the market
798019 storage is a top priority for us and we want to grow that to be no 1 in the market
798020 diverse open source it point solutions into an overarching consolidated view of their networks and systems while simultaneously increasing server admin ratio and maintaining to open source extensibility
798021 the biggest challenge in our university environment is being able to coordinate campus wide monitoring efforts while maintaining economies
798022 because of groundworks extensibility we are able to collaborate with multiple departments across campus and leverage the talent of other system administrators to gain central visibility into the health of our systems as we continue to increase our monitoring efforts we will be able to have a birds eye view of the university using groundwork monitor
798023 it is a great opportunity to participate in this years enterprise conference and work with educause in their mission of advancing higher education by promoting the intelligent use of information technology
798024 working with universities around the world groundwork helps university it managers walk a fine balance between needing reliable computing and managing costs
798025 community source software the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning
798026 we can see the exciting evolution of the technology sector reflected in the quality and variety of exceptional companies that we had to choose from in putting our list together
798027 we are delighted to be considered for prestigious red herring award because it recognizes the hard work and dedication that groundwork people have devoted to serving our growing list of global 2000 customers
798028 thanks to our people and the vision and expertise of our many customers and partners throughout the world groundwork is making a real difference in the cost and usefulness of it service management software as this years only recognized open source network and systems management company we are delighted that red herring recognizes these accomplishments
798029 makes it much easier for a business to try different solutions and selectively determine which services they really want
798030 the fact that no single vendor can arbitrarily kill off the product is in itself an extremely attractive feature for a company thats used to being at the mercy of mergers and acquisitions
798031 there is an assumption in many cases that open source is going to be cheaper
798032 and yes on paper its 100 percent cheaper but what people dont realize is that even if the software is free theres a shift in the cost of maintenance on to internal employees
798033 the open source community is an extremely powerful channel of support and is a unique element of open source that no single vendor could ever hope to replicate in terms of the breadth and depth of knowledge available
798034 the limitation presented by the open source community is that theres no sla service level agreement theres no guarantee that youre going to get an answer
798035 i see cios looking at tools that allow them to extend existing core it systems down to linux so they can treat the system like any other already on their network
798036 if they can deploy linux within the enterprise and administratively apply policy to that box just like they apply it to any windows environment on the network they would likely explore that option
798037 we see ourselves as an augmentation to the big platforms
798038 it is obvious that in shared global community needs open source is really taking off
798039 were seeing an evolution in how people are using open source tools in university environments
798040 with moodle we see that a lot of institutions are doing pilots or testing it out but when we compare that to what the designated standard is for a campus and what they use for delivery there is a discrepancy
798041 with elearning we still see that open source hasnt got the same traction as commercial software
798042 probably three or four years ago point solutions using an individual open source tool were probably good enough
798043 they are now being asked to combine their point solutions into a unified whole and also take into account other non open source stuff
798044 decisions are still principled rather than practical its more about believing in open source and having it as a strategy than just looking at the total cost of ownership
798045 the advice we give is that they have to have an overall strategy for this kind of implementation of software
798046 they may decide its great that we have this guy that can manage the system but he may graduate or he may not be available 24 7 so we need an airbag plan
798047 going with one of the big four or going with one of the open source vendors isnt an either or choice
798048 there are alternatives from smaller vendors that are displacing or complementing specific pieces of what the big vendors offer
798049 what we see is a melding of the offerings from smaller vendors with big vendors
798050 nagios 3 0 is an exciting next step for the nagios project
798051 these enhancements are something that i have been wanting to do for many years and thanks to the community nagios has reached a new level for larger deployments on wednesday ill talk about it monitoring issues to watch out for new tools and diving into what the future holds for nagios users
798052 groundwork and nagios have been working in partnership for more than four years and we will continue to work together to provide enterprises with monitoring tools that have the scalability and security to meet the it needs of major enterprises
798053 groundwork users should expect the integration of nagios 3 0 into groundwork monitor later this year
798054 our expanding base of global 2000 customers is proof that enterprises are choosing groundwork over the big four alternatives
798055 an average cost savings of around 80 percent is a huge factor but enterprise customers are selecting groundwork because our open source solutions integrate seamlessly with existing systems like windows aix tivoli openview netiq and many more and they appreciate groundworks ability to scale to more than 10 000 servers across distributed locations worldwide
798056 the lions share of market is hp openview and that is where we feel we offer the biggest benefit for the customer
798057 largely this is a wrapper or extension of our apis that is more accessible friendly to our users
798058 however due to its modular design and ease of use it has changed our engineering development patterns we can develop faster and provide additional components of functionality independent of the core hq management platform
798059 so they turn to their own scripts or a hybrid of other open source basics like nagios
798060 as they scale and change becomes more frequent these homegrown tools become brittle and require a lot of maintenance this is when they find hyperic and realize that we can help them lower their cost of service by providing a tailored flexible and scalable monitoring and management solution
798061 they are appealing to a mid market group of folks that are looking for cheap alternatives and that has its place
798062 last year we had started selling modular add ons to groundwork monitor professional that were really designed for people who were in distributed enterprise class environments
798063 those add ons were things like child servers that you could use in distributed environments
798064 we were getting pull from the enterprise to make official what we had been doing in a piecemeal fashion throughout 2007
798065 its a growing area of opportunity especially for firms that have staff expertise with open source
798066 its more of a slow wave thats building in terms of the opportunity and the growth
798067 certainly where companies have a good amount of staff resources in open source and are comfortable with that those folks are starting to mine out and consider where are areas they can save money by utilizing open source more effectively
798068 thats certainly growing and the economic situation in america is certainly putting more pressure on that the demand is growing but its still small in comparison to the broader market
798069 were actually competing specifically against subsets of their portfolios against things like openview operations the monitoring and event management pieces were not competing against the help desk or the cmdbs
798070 people are looking specifically at the monitoring and system event management piece and realizing that there are viable open source alternatives
798071 one of the first things i like to do when i come to a new opportunity is to stabilize the infrastructure so that it quiets down all the wire noise about systems failing
798072 i needed a systems monitoring tool so i could get to root causes and stabilize infrastructure
798073 the entire infrastructure was kind of a hodgepodge of systems that had been fit together by the last guy and none of them integrated with any of the others
798074 last year we had started selling modular add ons to groundwork monitor professional that were really designed for people who were in distributed enterprise class environments

798085 the entire infrastructure was kind of a hodgepodge of systems that had been fit together by the last guy and none of them integrated with any of the others
798086 there was never really any doubt in my mind that we were going to get everything done on time
798087 im just happy that everythings done and to officially be a new york jet just happy that all that stuffs done now and we can actually get down to the real football business and get the pads on
798088 i feel pretty confident with the offense right now ive been doing a lot of studying and getting everything down
798089 as far as expectations for the season i havent really set any true expectations for myself for right now i just want to get the offense down as good as i can and i want to go out there and give the jets everything ive got every chance im out there

798091 our expanding base of global 2000 customers is proof that enterprises are choosing groundwork over the big 4 alternatives
798092 an average cost savings of around 80 percent is a huge factor but enterprise customers are selecting groundwork because our open source solutions integrate seamlessly with existing systems like windows aix tivoli openview netiq and many more and they appreciate groundworks ability to scale more than 10 000 servers across distributed locations worldwide
798093 with economic uncertainty building on it organizations we are seeing enterprises tightening their belts when it comes to it budgets and initiatives
798094 as open source management solutions continue to mature and increase in functionality they will see more opportunities on the enterprise scale
798095 groundwork open source is the only vendor that leverages the commoditized value from open source monitoring projects supplements with monitoring best practices and delivers a scalable extensible solution that improves our efficiency without impacting our budget

798099 as open source management solutions continue to mature and increase in functionality they will see more opportunities on the enterprise scale
798100 in 2006 genworth selected groundwork monitor to manage multiple datacenters because of the solutions low cost and the integration with our existing open source tools
798101 groundwork open source is the only vendor that leverages the commoditized value from open source monitoring projects supplements with monitoring best practices and delivers a scalable extensible solution that improves our efficiency without impacting our budget
798102 the lions share of market is hp openview and that is where we feel we offer the biggest benefit for the customer

798107 they are appealing to a mid market group of folks that are looking for cheap alternatives and that has its place
798108 at the lowest level people are using us to maintain uptime and availability
798109 when they get over that hurdle and they dont have stuff exploding anymore theyre doing things regarding slas service level agreements to make sure they hit the performance levels they want to they will also use us for various performance measures capacity planning and sizing measures
798110 the general acceptance of open source in the enterprise has gone up a lot where people are comfortable with the fact that they can get comparable quality with a lot of open source options
798111 for a given medical condition its not unusual for one third of patients to feel better in response to treatment with placebo
798112 enterprise is designed for distributed environments with hundreds thousands or even 10 thousand devices and this version adds capacity in the form of more distributed functionality
798113 big systems management vendors charge per node while we charge a subscription price that covers the management server
798114 some functionality enhancements such as improvements to the event console historical reporting and greater scalability make groundwork 5 2 a much more viable solution for larger enterprise it implementations and certainly its price model is very attractive to budget conscious organizations
798115 groundwork has focused its development on providing quality point solutions around specific systems management problems and then providing a framework that links them together
798116 groundwork will likely see improved inroads into education and financial institutions that can take advantage of the flexibility inherent in a distributed solution
798117 but i dont see this significantly eroding the already entrenched market dominated by the big four

798124 hps acquisitions of peregrine mercury and opsware have resulted in more focus on architecture and integration rather than new product features and innovation in traditional management disciplines such as event correlation and analysis
798125 hp is by far our biggest partner and this is no way a slam against hp
798126 its simply our way of extending our market reach to areas hp software cant play for whatever reasons whether they are too big too robust too complex or not cost effective my goal is to extend our reach into the small and medium market where we really havent been successful with large commercial management solutions
798127 we are trying to use lower cost solutions for basic functionality and the more value based solutions for higher functionality
798128 with groundwork we have a low entry point it doesnt necessarily compete against hp because its business we werent going to necessarily win anyway and it gives us the potential to add hp functionality to these entry points because the customer didnt have to spend money on their basic management functions and these arent small mom and pop shops these are 100 million or 200 million companies they are not going to spend 2 percent of revenue on enterprise management
798129 as networks have become more integral to the success of smbs costs associated with deploying those networks have become significant
798130 simply adding more infrastructure to keep up with increasing network utilization is no longer a cost effective solution
798131 selecting the right solution is of critical importance both in the short and long term as your choice of monitoring solution will be the foundation upon which multiple layers of it management will be built
798132 you may be a one platform shop now but you cant guarantee you will be in the future
798133 essentially it operations should be viewed as an integral part of the business and the monitoring technology should support the model of business operations
798134 for example basic monitoring of an email server may involve measurements of ping timings however network performance in this case wont be able to detect the issues with the mail application taking too much time to open a mailbox
798135 this is why proactive management is critical in fact network management is directly related to it service delivery which recently has been recognized as one of the most important factors of business process and operations and business contingency as a whole
798136 capacity problems typically require additional resource investments while network policy management can often be used to reallocate underutilized bandwidth to alleviate critical bottlenecks
798137 in many instances we see high end traffic control and management systems lying unused in smaller organizations because they are just too complex for it administrators with small staffs and heavy workloads
798138 the best management scheme in the world is useless if its not used
798139 smb network management often has limited technical support staff management systems which are highly graphical and offer easy to use monitoring reporting and policy control capabilities are more likely to be utilized regularly in this market
798140 this information can be used to implement management policies that fine tune bandwidth utilization to improve application response time and control costs
798141 connectivity is becoming a multipronged affair with wi fi bluetooth and soon wimax all offering multiple routes to the network
798142 monitoring and management technologies will need to account for all of this by doing more with custom objects and meta definitions that you can define to suit your needs
798143 were seeing enterprise growing faster for us enterprise customers see more and more of a great price advantage with what were doing and those customers tend to be stickier
798144 the open source option is turning out to be stronger with the big boys than smb
798145 im convinced groundwors model of integrating best of breed open source projects into a comprehensive to free enterprise customers from legacy vendor lock in is a major market opportunity and the next big industry vertical to be conquered by the compelling benefits of open source softwares value proposition
798146 2008 will be an exciting time for groundwork as we continue to show the disruptive power of open source in the enterprise environment
798147 taras ability to effectively market commercial open source is validated by one word sugarcrm
798148 taras unique talent and experience will take groundwork open source to the next level of growth
798149 groundwork monitor can manage the availability and performance of a vast spectrum of servers and devices often its extent is unrealized to those who are implementing it the getting started online training hosted by groundwork university give users new techniques and practices that enables them to efficiently deploy groundwork monitor within their network environment
798150 we are excited to not only be a gold sponsor at this years scale but also have the privilege of giving attendees an inside look into our newest monitor version
798151 our latest enhancements will improve how enterprise customers deploy and work with groundwork giving them the operational efficiency at a fraction of the cost of closed source alternatives

798170 the judges selection of groundwork monitor professional 5 1 reinforces the message sent by our customers as they search for cost effective open and enterprise ready system management alternatives to the costly status quo of the last decade or more
798171 ok in these particular categories of technology there are viable good open source solutions that offer comparative advantage over proprietary ones but in some other areas thats not true
798172 where can we use something that is at least 80 percent of what were using now but costs 20 percent as much
798173 weve got to stick with what we have because there is no viable alternative

798186 in 2008 open source will increasingly contribute to solving what i call the
798187 it executives will see more clearly that open source solutions now routinely provide security high availability robustness scalability and other enterprise quality features
798188 extending proven governance policies to new generation resources will further convince management that open source solutions are as controllable as established proprietary solutions and as capable of providing measurable business value
798189 based on open architectures such as soa and open standards
798190 in 2008 enterprise it management will increasingly move to restructure existing assets to support a more agile application model that delivers business services created through use of components
798191 open source will continue to grow as an enabling force for business because of its

798196 we were working with a number of systems management and monitoring tools including it monitor ibm direct cisco works and nagios for events
798197 customisation became a key factor for us we couldnt modify our current solution so we started looking for another long term solution that would work towards further enhancing our capabilities and performance
798198 group 1s set of requirements while not unique were exacting
798199 once we discussed their challenges we came to the conclusion that groundwork was by far the best solution for them bringing them a first class
798200 groundwork monitor professional is unique in its ability to extend the capabilities of existing it management and monitoring systems including well known proprietary systems
798201 our solution is easy to install flexible and can fill in the gaps left by larger more unwieldy tools many large companies like group 1 are finding that groundwork can make the difference between a failed shelfware project and truly getting value from these large and costly projects that we all know monitoring can be
798202 we wanted to enhance our online support offering so we could provide our customers and partners with the superior support theyve come to expect
798203 groundwork connect will help them get the most out of groundwork monitor they will be able to download software have questions answered search documentation log cases and even communicate with other users
798204 a centralized store of it management information lets the community pool categorize and share their common knowledge and best practices
798205 products and projects that enable maintain and encourage this kind of knowledge base are helping move us from a world where we search on google and hope we can find the answer to one where troubleshooting and other management devices are easier and faster to find

798212 now more than ever open source alternatives to systems and network management software are establishing a secure foothold in a market historically dominated by feature bloated expensive proprietary solutions
798213 groundwork believes open source provides just right management functionality at a fraction of the cost and the market has responded
798214 managing in the open the next wave of systems management
798215 open source is breathing new competitive life into systems management ultimately forcing the established vendors to respond in their products pricing and strategies
798216 open source could give potential challengers the cost and ease of implementation advantages they need to take on such formidable opponents
798217 managing in the open the next wave of systems management
798218 managing in the open the next wave of systems management
798219 compared to expensive legacy proprietary solutions the higher flexibility and lower cost of open source makes it a better fit for evolving it environments
798220 as a leading systems integrator in japan fujitsu ssl utilized groundwork to help provide their customers with a viable open source it infrastructure monitoring solution we are pleased that one of their first customers was such a large and prestigious international firm
798221 this japanese financial institution currently uses a variety of proprietary it management solutions but they were looking for a cost effective solution due to the complexity of the environment and the requirement for better usability and visibility into their entire it infrastructure
798222 fujitsu ssls support along with groundworks network monitoring solution capabilities met their requirements and exceeded their expectations
798223 with the invaluable assistance of the council groundwork continues to stay on the leading edge in open source it management sponsoring the council is part of our commitment to provide community endorsed tools in a platform that is easy to use and meets the needs of it today and tomorrow
798224 equally important is the benefit the council provides to the open source community in general
798225 for example last year matt massie and tobi oetiker met in person for the first time and discussed a change to the rrdtool database schema that would make ganglia more efficient tobi returned to switzerland thought about it and implemented the changes matt proposed when a group of developers of this caliber get together the innovation that results benefits everyone
798226 responding quickly to customer needs has always been a high priority for groundwork
798227 groundwork factory makes it possible for us to do so the increased support for vmware environments and for apache tomcat and other jvms is just one example the first of many to come from groundwork factory of the way we demonstrate our commitment to our customers
798228 managing in the open the next wave of systems management
798229 the big four systems management vendors bmc hp ibm and ca are ripe for a shake up from open source systems management players
798230 lead developers from todays best of breed open source it infrastructure and network monitoring projects
798231 the biggest story around the big four is how they will compete against microsoft oracle emc sap and symantec which are moving more aggressively into the management market this is already happening right now the big four still dominate the market but have lost crucial domains to microsoft and the oracle domain is being challenged
798232 which large established vendors could persuade you to forget about the big four and focus your infrastructure management investment elsewhere and why what about these vendors makes you think they can also tackle management better for your environment
798233 are companies such as emc microsoft oracle sap and symantec a threat to the big 4
798234 microsoft is definitely a contender though 1 3 years out theyre in year 4 of their 10 year plan that said their plan seems good once they ship a hyper visor with all their oses and get that widely spread things could get very interesting and in their favor
798235 obviously i think the open source folks such as groundwork zenoss and hyperic have a chance to be one of these emerging management challengers as well i suspect that if when one of them becomes successful therell be a lot more sniffing around for acquisition by one of the big 4
798236 emc by way of vmware is another interesting one whoever controls the majority of virtualization technology in the future will have a huge chance for doing a lot of it management tooling well see what happens post ipo
798237 symantec is interesting but i think theyd need to partner acquire or be acquired by someone to fully built up their presence
798238 the major potential threat to it management is a mass move to saas based applications while its sort of pie in the sky to my mind the only real thing holding back large enterprises from going saas is a culture change if the collective pool of enterprise thinking suddenly thought that saas was ok i could see lots of people switching over email erp and other things this is the sort of dream we have every 5 years or so we called it asp and managed service last so well see how this go at it goes the keys this time are a getting companies to accept simple solutions rather than feature ful ones and b a possible generational shift in what it means once all the myspace facebook whizbang 2 0 people enter middle management or at least start more heavily influencing it spend
798239 i suspect that if when one of them becomes successful therell be a lot more sniffing around for acquisition by one of the big 4
798240 groundwork puts a premium on training and we want to be sure to provide our customers and partners every opportunity to learn how to most effectively utilize groundwork monitor within their environment
798241 nagios enterprises is pleased to collaborate with groundwork open source
798242 over the past 18 months groundwork has done some great things with nagios in developing a comprehensive it management solution and nagios enterprises can now extend the joint value further with the new formalized working relationship
798243 weve found that some customer deployments are focused primarily on monitoring while others are focused on broader system management
798244 partnering like this allows each party to focus on their core competencies for the best time to value namely monitoring and broad system management and integration
798245 groundwork combines the backing of a commercial software company with the strength of the open source community and is responding to the strong demand for the groundwork it monitoring solutions for ubuntu and other debian based linux systems
798246 ubuntu is an extremely popular linux distribution and it is natural for us to make groundwork monitor open source available on that platform
798247 our vision is for ubuntu users and all debian users to have access to high quality it monitoring comparable to proprietary systems costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
798248 the ganglia to groundwork integration module enables a rich set of added functionality to standalone ganglia
798249 the ability to combine data from ganglia with data from other monitoring tools is a tremendous boon to it staff everywhere
798250 keeping to our commitment to unify open source it monitoring tools into a comprehensive package the ganglia to groundwork integration module fills an enormous need
798251 as even pedestrian it deployments grow larger scalability is becoming more of an issue because it hails from a grid and cluster environment ganglia provides the headroom to scale as the number of nodes being managed increases
798252 following our early collaboration with groundwork through rhx it was a natural decision to expand our relationship
798253 we think customers will welcome the additional options in support were offering
798254 groundwork has been a participant in red hat exchange since its initial offering in may 2007 and the relationship has been beneficial to our organization and customers
798255 were very pleased to be able to offer a more complete solution to our joint customers going forth
798256 we noticed a shift in buying patterns that is associated with a growing interest in open source solutions
798257 our main goal is to help our customers save money and grow their business adding groundwork open source solutions to our portfolio will enable our customers to effectively leverage open source tools as a legitimate enterprise management solution for mission critical environments
798258 many government agencies are looking to open source to tie together a mixed network of different systems
798259 groundwork open source offers government customers an extremely cost effective way of deploying flexible management for a wide range of existing network services we are excited to bring this technology to our government customers and partners
798260 although there are some great proprietary network management solutions on the market many government customers are looking for a less expensive and simpler solution
798261 groundwork products offer government organizations 80 percent of the functionality of the big name management products at a fraction of the cost
798262 the addition of melillo consulting and carahsoft to our network of partners is a reflection of groundworks successful channel strategy at work both of these companies are leaders in their respective areas and were pleased to be going to market with them
798263 additionally with the high demand for groundwork products in the government sector the new gsa contract schedule makes it easier for our customers to buy our products and services
798264 oct 24 2007 groundwork press release white papers webcasts and downloads trust and competitive advantage an integrated approach to governance risk management and compliance reduce your costs and prepare for tomorrow with bmc control m still struggling to reduce call center costs without losing customers
798265 managing in the open the new wave of systems management
798266 open source is breathing new competitive life into systems management ultimately forcing the established vendors to respond in their products pricing and strategies
798267 open source is encroaching in several arenas but in particular with management software that helps companies manage their sprawling networks
798268 we havent even begun to see the full impact of open source in this space
798269 in reality studies show that over 50 of the features in the proprietary versions are never installed think of what features you use in microsoft word for instance what percentage of the features do you estimate you use in that
798270 the initial licensing fees for both openview and vantage were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and simply far beyond what our budget would allow
798271 to get the customized dashboards we wanted we would have incurred additional consulting fees the enterprise license agreements did not allow our staff to customize these systems and when we talked about scalability with these vendors the overall price tags began to approach the million dollar mark
798272 we gained immediate results with the software right out of the box yet we were also able to make unique configuration changes simply not possible with other enterprise class tools
798273 the combination of sun and mysql means quicker access t
798274 this means you can migrate a live application from one hardware platform running the xen environment to another hardware platform without having to stop the application this gives tremendous flexibility to the customer to fully utilize their resources
798275 rhel5 1 also adds additional support for some embedded features for the intel itanium2 and amd pacifica chipsets to give better virtualization performance for customers running on those chipsets
798276 we want to be ready to abandon ship when the next microsoft os comes out or seriously consider jumping overboard
798277 james her husband is learning to use ubuntu actually hes still learning to install it
798278 so far it recognizes that we have a printer but not that it ought to run it
798279 is a flaccid overstuffed os that has crashed in the middle of every task hes tried to do microsoft will be lucky if the whole planet doesnt go mac and linux
798280 this the zumwalt project is a great showcase for linux technology
798281 we dont believe the navy can afford to put old technologies onto any ships
798282 zumwalt technologies advance mission capabilities to address current and evolving threats and support lower ship personnel levels and lower operating costs these technologies can be leveraged for future or existing ships
798283 but microsoft which committed to selling 240 million in suse certificates as part of its 2006 agreement with novell is less and less a part of our linux business because the core customer base is growing
798284 the idc report on open source software growth is a great indication of the overall strength in open source sales obviously we at sugar are true believers what we see however is a significantly stronger demand in the enterprise for commercial open source software than indicated in idcs numbers our own sales figures indicate a much more radical pull than this report suggests and im willing to bet were not the only open source company in this situation the so called next gen open source software products applications above the infrastructure stack directly touching the end user are showing significant demand both domestically and internationally dont be surprised to see idc revise its figures upward by this time next year
798285 in enterprise middleware were actually seeing open source entering a next phase in its evolution the advantages of open source development and distribution methodologies are transcending the initial low cost discussions and actually delivering features and functionality beyond whats available from proprietary vendors
798286 top tier analysts seem to agree that the stars are aligning for open source not only from an adoption and revenue perspective but as a serious threat to legacy proprietary players
798287 the biggest sea change driving the new market growth that idc forecasts is the mainstreaming of oss products in the mind of customers to them its all just software after all and buying decisions are made simply on product functionality esp ease of use price and the likelihood of quality support going forward this mindset change plays right into the wheelhouse of oss and represents major progress and opportunity for open source vendors microsoft obviously is aware of the threat given their recent flailing regarding patents
798288 the idc numbers are a nice proof point for what weve been seeing around the globe and support what were experiencing with our own business an increase in adoption in both the alfresco community and with subscription customers that has resulted in a 300 increase in revenues were also seeing that enterprise open source adoption is strongest in the united states with community and government partners thriving across europe in the uk where alfresco is headquartered its a bit different open source software deployments are fewer in number but with more offerings from companies like our own and these latest idc predictions we would expect that to change
798289 idcs latest open source software research is further proof that open source is simply a better way to fulfill customer needs while linux has been a touchstone for the success of community developed software this research shows the wide and deep reach of open source software of all types idcs latest research tells us that linux and open source software will continue to outpace proprietary alternatives
798290 the idc numbers reaffirm for us something we all know open source software is growing because it solves real problems for customers but to achieve the numbers idc predicts and to push them even further interoperability among open solutions must be paramount the osa has made this central to its mission and were seeing the need for and benefits of addressing interoperability through increasing involvement in our projects were looking forward to being a part of the next level of adoption for open solutions
798291 the idc report shows what our customers have been telling us the horse is out of the barn for open source software open source software and licenses have bypassed procurement and spread rapidly throughout enterprises due to freely available downloads our enterprise customers are already using an average of 75 open source packages that cover a wide range of product categories with the rapid spread of open source software companies are now looking for ways to safely acquire support and control open source software their desire to gain the rewards of open source while managing risks will be a key element in driving open source revenue in the next five years
798292 idcs latest data is hardly surprising no major barriers remain for deploying open source on a mass basis i expect that the idc predictions will be widely surpassed as open source moves beyond early adopters to mainstream users looking for openness and value funambol is accelerating the adoption of open source by providing wireless carriers around the world with mobile email for the masses that is better faster and cheaper than proprietary alternatives
798293 jaspersoft agrees that opens source software is in a significant growth stage we know that successful open source projects like jasperserver and jasperreports are seeing enormous traction in the market and are multiplying their revenues each quarter one reason is that open source can take advantage of emerging global channels and reach markets that proprietary solutions simply cannot
798294 the idc numbers reflect a realization by the market that open source software is addressing the long running frustrations customers have with proprietary software a good part of the explosive and non stop growth is due to the fact that the oss model wasnt designed to help a single company but rather an entire ecosystem it execs cfos developers and end users idc calls this an immature market well weve already seen the disruption this immature market has had not only on the software industry but also on the industries it serves open source has the momentum of a freight train one im glad im on and not standing in front of like my proprietary competitors
798295 there should be a place where you can go to find trusted open source applications
798296 i am very pleased to announce that as of today you can
798297 we tried to cut through a lot of the marketing language often customers really just want the facts
798298 the invitation from red hat to be a part of rhx further validates our leadership in the open source it management category
798299 given red hats leadership with linux i believe what mike evans vp of corporate development at red hat said earlier with rhx red hat is in a position to become the amazon of open source software and it is truly exciting to be part of that wave
798300 we are thrilled to offer groundworks leading open source it management software on red hat exchange available today
798301 through red hat exchange customers will have a central location for all of their open source application needs and as always we are pleased to offer our customers more choice
798302 ripe for a shake up from open source systems management players
798303 open source vendors covered in the 60 page report titled
798304 open source could give potential challengers the cost and ease of implementation advantages they need to take on such formidable opponents yet open source systems management vendors still face an uphill battle against entrenched players with their existing integrated suites and established customers
798305 you would be wise to listen to the customers youre threatening to sue they can leave you especially if you give them motivation remember they wouldnt be motivated unless your products were somehow missing the mark
798306 if ms windows source code is subjected to the same critical review as linux has been it would be more likely that ms violates more valid patents of others
798307 theyre doing something weve already done and theyre doing it slightly differently
798308 id actually submit they are doing it in a channel unfriendly way
798309 what red hat is doing is they are cutting the reseller and the solution provider out of the equation
798310 they are asking the end customer to come directly to red hat exchange which to me leaves the solution provider out of the equation
798311 we got introduced to a couple of channel partners that weve since forged relationships with so the program has given us visibility
798312 but that program is drastically different than red hats exchange
798313 to us it looks like red hat is a channel partner we are going to get listed in their exchange and customers can then just come and by product from there
798314 we applaud red hat for taking the leadership to help drive open source applications and middleware to the market
798315 furthermore we believe that rhx will be complementary to spikesources efforts to bring business ready open source solutions to market
798316 looking at red hat and red hat exchange and having that whole e commerce thing is just something that would take us as a small company an enormous amount of effort to build out on our own
798317 if you sign up as a var you get training and margin points off of list price and then you resell the product
798318 were looking at rhx as a key channel opportunity for us and that absolutely comes with an understood revenue share
798319 we dont need to have our own direct sales force in every part of the world we need our partners whether it is a local systems integrator or big players like red hat
798320 we need them to help spread the news and make it easier for people to find and learn about zimbra
798321 it could be because an application was poorly coded or because the application is chatty with lots of calls to the corporate database before it gets to the end users screen
798322 everyone knows when a call is good or not if they experience a delay stuttering or no dial tone they are going to hang up
798323 you dont really see 100 microsoft or cisco setups anymore and a static approach makes things that much harder
798324 you need to have an idea of how many devices it can monitor can it monitor 1 000 2 000 or more and how many of them can be auto discovered
798325 mid market cios are less fearful of open source as long as its a good solution
798326 and i can use the money i wouldve spent on a proprietary solution on other projects
798327 groundwork is far easier to deploy manage and sustain in the course of my career ive rolled out all of the big 4
798328 we were able to leverage other open source tools and tie them in to groundwork to for example audit syslogs
798329 we use open source to leverage commodified technology and then pass the cost savings on to the customer
798330 an end user or msp could download it and start monitoring the machines on their network
798331 in the case of an msp as many of their customers as they can fit on that single machine its a us 16 000 annual fee regardless of how they charge their customers
798332 groundwork factory enables us to add additional value to the groundwork platform
798333 in combination with groundwork monitor professional the groundwork factory will become a valuable source of expertise information and reusable extensions for our partners our customers and the community
798334 increasingly it management platforms must be extensible and flexible enough to respond to and enable quick changes in an organizations business environment
798335 currently were seeing the application of soa thinking to create it management platforms that can fit these needs for rapid change and expandability coupled with the innovation advantages that an open source base brings groundwork factory is groundwork open sources answer to this emerging it management soa approach
798336 we needed a flexible monitoring solution that would allow us to gain essential insight into our network
798337 groundwork monitor professional was the right choice it fits the needs of our network can scale with us as we grow is easy to configure and integrates smoothly into our existing infrastructure
798338 commonwealth is the second largest privately held independent broker dealer in the nation and system uptime and health is mission critical to our business
798339 groundworks open source foundations allow us to peer into any area of our hardware and software assets performance without the cost and delay of a feature request for every new parameter we would like to monitor
798340 transforms it into an enterprise ready it management solution by adding functional enhancements as well as deployment services and ongoing support
798341 it is outrageous that so much of managers valuable time is wasted due to poor it maintenance and management technology should be a key enabler to help managers run their businesses efficiently and effectively it should save us time so we can focus on the core task of running our businesses something has gone badly wrong and has to change
798342 globalization of successful businesses coupled with more flexible and mobile work forces have driven innovation within even the largest of companies
798343 technology has played its part in helping to drive this innovation but just as any other resource in an organization technology needs to be maintained and managed it needs time devoted to it to ensure that the most benefit is gained
798344 groundworks strong start to 2007 demonstrates that open source systems and network management continues to gain a foothold in the mid market as companies realize that they no longer need to fall victim to the costs of hp openview and others
798345 these legacy proprietary solutions do not provide enough additional value to justify the magnitude more cost relative to open source alternatives and thats good news for customers
798346 we needed a strong monitoring solution to keep an eye on it operations and network traffic but did not want to pay for features we would not use
798347 groundwork delivered giving us clear insight into our network while taking advantage of the lower cost and flexibility of open source
798348 at incentra our goal is to provide a full range of it solutions for enterprise customers
798349 open source provides customers more flexibility and you cant beat the price it is a great fit for dynamic and heterogeneous it environments operating under budget constraints groundworks open source solution is going to change the it operations market and provide new options for it managers
798350 inflexible expensive proprietary solutions from the big 4 vendors simply do not provide enough additional value in comparison to open source alternatives to justify the magnitude more cost i predict a draining the cost pool for customers and a paradigm shift in the way they view management solutions big fish vendors will be pushed down to the deep end where they can add value while the adoption of best of breed open source solutions will lower the customer cost water line in the shallow end
798351 osm open source management industry appears to be a more immediate threat to the major it management software vendors that have no intention for now of offering osm products
798352 frequently the limiting factor in overall application performance is the database itself
798353 groundwork monitor professional will dramatically help users of oracle databases manage their enterprise applications far more effectively and efficiently than before
798354 we are delighted to have worked closely with groundwork to help deliver this solution and we see a huge demand for business critical open source solutions for our oracle users
798355 one could argue that novell was a little early to market with their marketstart program at that time open source adoption in enterprises was still too nascent
798356 fast forward 12 to 18 months the rhx program recognizes that in addition to the product and isv the community and channels play a huge role for the ecosystem to thrive
798357 the community and the channel have come a long way in the last 12 to 18 months
798358 we want to do some services work but were not becoming an ibm global services
798359 we see this as helping partners because it lets customers buy where they want to buy from
798360 they know they can buy subscriptions directly from rhx or through channel partners
798361 we see different types of companies that will prefer to buy with their favorite reseller
798362 and reseller access to rhx is a value to the reseller because they can extend their business and the reach of our solution to a broader set of mid size companies
798363 groundwork monitor open source provides organizations the chance to tap into a free customizable monitoring solution with a thriving community and we continue to innovate with key functionality required by systems and network administrators
798364 the new functionality in this latest version is no exception and represents a direct response to the overwhelming support and requests of our community members
798365 groundwork has brought all the best open source projects together in one complete solution giving systems administrators freedom of choice over expensive proprietary alternatives
798366 with the improved speed of the status viewer console and integrated performance analysis the new version of groundwork monitor open source is a significant advancement for the open source community
798367 so we are not just providing an online store where customers can buy that software what we are providing is a fully integrated stack that includes enterprise linux or the red hat applications stack which is essentially a bundle of jboss middleware and enterprise linux along with the isv application
798368 there is no substantial discount involved but the advantage is that this price includes the red hat infrastructure software as well as the partner application software which is all delivered over red hat network and is all supported by red hat
798369 we have mutual support agreements in place with each one of the isvs but we have designed the system to avoid the dreaded handoff we will hold the case through conclusion and manage any escalations
798370 as we work with customers to resolve their cases we basically have a workflow that we will be contributing to that public knowledge base available to subscribers
798371 when customers can minimize the number of number of vendors they are dealing with and the associated number of support contracts they can reduce the complexity and often the cost associated with managing workloads
798372 what attracted me to groundwork were the market disrupting potential of the technology and the business model of the company
798373 the proprietary approach to systems and network management with its feature bloat and high cost is incompatible with the mid market
798374 as groundwork continues to garner leadership and widen the lead in the open source systems and network management marketplace a lot of vendors have approached us
798375 were continuing to strengthen the management team with proven industry talent and vicki is a perfect fit help groundwork extend our reach through key industry partnerships
798376 groundwork is excited to team with actuate to offer detailed sla reports and a framework specifically tailored to the needs of it personnel
798377 as open source systems management software solves the key needs of mid market organizations customers continue to move away from the monolithic and proprietary it management vendors towards these flexible open source alternatives like groundwork monitor professional
798378 birt is a logical extension to groundwork monitor professional because groundworks customers need clear accurate reports to give them added confidence in their business critical applications
798379 were excited to support groundwork to ensure the design and development of compelling birt based sla reports for the groundwork platform
798380 architect an open source strategy that makes both bmc and the open source community at large successful really forge the collaboration between the company and the community
798381 what an interesting turn of events continuing with the trend of legacy proprietary software vendors cozying up with open source a la microsoft bmc is the first of the big 4 which also includes hp openview ibm tivoli and ca unicenter to make the bold admission that open source represents the future of systems and network management
798382 bmcs hiring of open source expert whurley just goes to show that even the largest enterprise systems management vendors understand that they need to look to open source to stay competitive going forward its a positive sign to see them acquiring talent versed in the collaborative nature of open source it should be a strong statement to any enterprise systems management user the direction the industry is headed
798383 the market for open source management products is really maturing and having an impact on the big four management vendors
798384 there is such a prevalence of open source software out there now outside of management that customers are now looking to find tools to manage their open source deployments that also have the open source model
798385 today some of the best management options are coming out of the open source community and not from commercial vendors
798386 its a great deal for hyperic to have red hat engaged in this effort
798387 usr local groundwork share php usr local groundwork share pear

798393 we dont believe the navy can afford to put old technologies onto any ships
798394 zumwalt technologies advance mission capabilities to address current and evolving threats and support lower ship personnel levels and lower operating costs these technologies can be leveraged for future or existing ships
798395 but microsoft which committed to selling 240 million in suse certificates as part of its 2006 agreement with novell is less and less a part of our linux business because the core customer base is growing
798396 we noticed a shift in buying patterns that is associated with a growing interest in open source solutions
798397 our main goal is to help our customers save money and grow their business adding groundwork open source solutions to our portfolio will enable our customers to effectively leverage open source tools as a legitimate enterprise management solution for mission critical environments

798399 groundwork open source offers government customers an extremely cost effective way of deploying flexible management for a wide range of existing network services we are excited to bring this technology to our government customers and partners
798400 although there are some great proprietary network management solutions on the market many government customers are looking for a less expensive and simpler solution

798402 oh you know that perfume of yours that you use haves that amazing great smell that i love
798403 combining open source and other sources zenoss core is a complete solution that monitors all components including applications at the event performance and configuration level
798404 this is an example of groundworks commitment to not only our commercial customers but also to the open source community
798405 groundwork combines the backing of a commercial software company with the strength of the open source community and is responding to the strong demand for the groundwork it monitoring solutions for ubuntu and other debian based linux systems
798406 ubuntu is an extremely popular linux distribution and it is natural for us to make groundwork monitor open source available on that platform
798407 with its new operating system midori microsoft may finally be giving up on windows

798415 everyone said nicholsons joker could not be topped now heath ledger is giving him a run for his money with a performance that has already gone down in the lore of film history as something otherworldly even the rumors of how he prepped for the role are shrouded in a mystique that promises well see something that will blow our minds
798416 it was a challenged environment planetout had been around for quite some time and the operations team didnt keep up
798417 it was one of the first things on my plate
798418 there was no resistance the resistance was oh were about to spend a big chunk of money upgrading these servers but there wasnt any question about using open source
798419 incredibly fast we had it up and running in 30 days from nothing
798420 if somethings cheap but it stinks im still not going to buy it
798421 there are many organizations that think theres no support so we need to stay away from it
798422 bigger companies just spend the money for a commercial product
798423 i dont try to think of it as open source or commercial but what is the right thing to solve the problem if it happens to be open source and free all the better
798424 myth 3 your it staff can buy a raw tool and shape it to their needs
798425 one could argue that hippos are a useful metaphor for large ungainly incumbent legacy monolithic proprietary software vendors there is another metaphor from the animal kington that describes quite a different approach by groundwork consider the piranha by itself a piranha is almost harmless one piranha will never take down a hippo for example but what happens if piranha school they can and do gobble up the hippo though rare it is happening and happening successfully
798426 regarding our system we were caught between a rock and a hard place we needed a solution with enough power reach and flexibility to help us prevent system problems that could bring the university to a standstill but we were working with a limited budget
798427 the initial licensing fees for either openview or vantage were in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and simply far beyond what our budget would allow to get the customized dashboards we needed we would have incurred additional consulting fees the enterprise license agreements did not allow our staff to customize these systems and when we talked about scalability with these vendors the overall price tags began to approach the million dollar mark

798429 microsoft has even heard of this and has speculated about whether they might join
798430 it encourages a broader vision and broader effort by doing it formally it brings a structure and formality to the exercise
798431 we do see a center of gravity around this effort that will have to be taken seriously
798432 we are unique in the consortium line up because we are not focused on a specific technology
798433 this is bout lowering barriers to adoption and making it easier for business users to use this software its higher up the stack were focusing at the deployed solutions level
798434 we aim to grow the business so that in three years it will be the same as the microsoft business is today
798435 using open source technology as a change agent its a great opportunity to step back and see where do you want to be
798436 people are still looking at it from the cost side but not what does it open up for us thats the great big wave weve got to encourage customers to take that next step
798437 fruitless debates about the five year tco of microsoft and linux
798438 really the movement is from proprietary to open source what open source does give you that proprietary software cant is this potential for innovation
798439 were building up our skills in this area alongside the microsoft environment be believe theyll co exist
798440 most people have apache but its not part of their core strategy what we want to do is make this center stage
798441 we are excited to have groundwork as a member of osa
798442 the systems and network management space is a perfect example of how open source software can make inroads into the enterprise
798443 in less than three years groundwork has become the leader in open source systems and network management
798444 we are looking forward to our involvement with osa and accelerating the adoption of open source in the enterprise
798445 first theres a lack of awareness about open source second its hard to build a solution with open source because business solutions need to do a lot of things but businesses dont want point solutions they want complete solutions
798446 members must be an isv or have a product that is based on open source
798447 membership is open to organizations that provide high quality business ready open source solutions
798448 we didnt take a stance on it so we could get the launch done
798449 but we do know that a business has to be supporting the open source project that their project is based off of they should be contributing code and effort back into the project and moving it forward
798450 its something we all deal with and weve certainly all run into the same problems
798451 its for people who want to publicly back the osa yet dont want to commit in larger ways
798452 as a company that both develops open source projects and unifies existing best of breed projects into a single solution we thought that osa was ideal in that it is bringing together both isvs and systems integrators
798453 we feel there is much to gain among the synergies and unique skill sets of each of the member organizations
798454 a leadership role in helping to define open software communication protocols among the various business applications the ability to seamlessly couple applications like business reporting and application monitoring has far reaching benefits throughout an enterprise
798455 in less than three years groundwork has established an irrefutable leadership position in open source systems and network management offering a viable and compelling open source alternative to proprietary it monitoring solutions
798456 we invested because there is a tremendous untapped market opportunity in the mid market for groundworks solution and their seasoned management team is ideally poised to capitalize on this opportunity
798457 we see enormous synergies with groundworks technology and its ability to monitor installations of sap applications which are seamlessly integrated into a comprehensive system wide monitoring solution
798458 for mid market customers groundwork will help reduce total cost of ownership
798459 in 2006 we successfully monetized our business and achieved escape velocity in the open source systems and network management space in 2007 we see a growing and profitable business taking share from proprietary products like hp openview as the mid market better understands the value and maturity of our offering
798460 groundworks unparalleled growth and traction in 2006 is a testament to the confidence it directors have gained in using open source software to manage business critical systems and networks
798461 we see groundworks open source product as a disruptive technology in the japanese it systems and network management market
798462 open source is on the rise in japan and we are pleased to offer a solution like groundwork monitor professional to compliment our portfolio of proprietary
798463 in certain cases for large database the large node scenario that we can deliver with the es7000s has big performance benefits
798464 moreover because the es7000 can be broken down into smaller virtual nodes customers can experiment and find the right node structure and node size for their databases and applications
798465 we saw how immature many of these monitoring and management projects were and realized that it was quicker and cheaper for us to develop products with open source
798466 open source with its higher flexibility and lower cost is a better fit than proprietary solutions for dynamic it environments that are operating under budget constraints
798467 this inclusion of an open source it infrastructure monitoring solution by japans leading systems integrator is just one example of the way in which the country is moving towards mainstream support of open source
798468 we see groundworks open source product as a disruptive technology in the japanese it operations market
798469 open source is on the rise in japan and we are pleased to offer a solution like groundwork monitor professional that compliments our portfolio of it monitoring solutions
798470 i want to check on the status of this certain network port on this cisco switch
798471 i want to check the file systems free space on my windows server
798472 i want to check on the status of this certain network port on this cisco switch
798473 i want to check the file systems free space on my windows server
798474 but after looking deeper it also becomes clear that reliability and service levels are also highly linked to the complexity and diversity in an environment and there are big wins here as well
798475 people are getting tired of having too many links in the chain and having to constantly reverse engineer their data center every time something goes wrong
798476 we view this as an intelligence gap and because organizations have not had visibility into their excess capacity and analysis that allows them to safely make use of it the result has been a proliferation of underutilized systems
798477 the problem is that firewalls and perimeter defenses are great for keeping network worms and hackers out but anything browser based goes straight through the firewall because its initiated from a trusted place the inside
798478 you simply cant patch 1 000 pcs every month when microsoft does its monthly update and the bad guys understand that they know that even a simple exploit will be effective in corporations long after microsoft has released its patch
798479 the over capacity that existed after the dot com bubble has been exhausted and we are fully in the supply constrained market
798480 consider that google amazon and others are building large data centers in oregon right next to hydroelectric plants congress is even holding hearings and may in the future mandate certain efficiency requirements for data center equipment so at least for the next two years we will remain in this market
798481 were moving past the era of monolithic big box storage into a new age where storage virtualization in the san commoditizes the big boxes enabling and encouraging their acquisition from the lowest bidder
798482 storage administrators sas will no longer routinely manage their storage arrays so when something does need to be done at that level the sa will lack the skill to reliably do the work
798483 the result will be an environment that is more complex and less understood prone to unforeseen adverse interactions among its components
798484 one item that is getting more and more attention is the amount of energy that is used in data centers not just for the computers systems but the supporting infrastructure as well as the cost of energy continues to rise cfos and ceos are looking at their big power bills and asking who is using all this electricity right at the top of the list is the data center often the word comes down to cut your power usage a demand that is easy to make and hard to do
798485 one of the most important issues facing it managers today is gaining control of their it infrastructure with the declining cost of hardware the number of servers and storage in the sme data center continues to grow at a rapid pace with this growth data centers in smes are starting to look more and more like the data centers larger enterprises had just a few short years ago with this growth comes both the urge and the necessity to manage the infrastructure so that visibility into the network is kept high information is kept secure and viable and problems are fixed before they snowball or are prevented entirely
798486 it managers face simultaneously internal and external issues that will pull on their resources the most significant internal issue is centered about the customers users and their expectation more and more this expectation is expressed in terms of how it connects its services to the business side of the house it is a strategic partnership and it is about impacting the bottom line externally it is about security and privacy issues we want the community to be confident in our ability to protect their information and value their privacy
798487 third party help desk ticketing asset tracking and cmdb systems that are often already deployed in enterprise datacenters
798488 average cost savings of around 80 percent is a huge factor but enterprise customers are selecting groundwork because our open source solutions integrate seamlessly with existing systems like tivoli and openview
798489 when i first got there in 2006 there were only a few servers being monitored there was only a limited amount of historical graphing we were flying blind
798490 we were being told of problems by our customers instead of knowing about server issues ourselves
798491 at symantec we did extensive work with nagios and were able to extend it throughout the enterprise
798492 any systems administrator can have nagios up and running on their environment but if you want to extend it further than that you need an expert
798493 at planetout the server situation required that we have something up and running very quickly
798494 with the time frame we had we needed something up and running immediately
798495 groundwork staff came in and deployed that and then we had them watching the alerts for us
798496 they made sure things were running fine for those three servers up to the point when we turned on the application for real then we started getting barraged every five minutes with alerts
798497 wed have to take our ha box and basically start over with it wed have to export out the database and re import it thankfully we had that ha server to begin with whereas having just a single server would have made things harder to do
798498 we are definitely looking forward to groundworks ultimate goal of upgrading and installing a new rpm and that being it
798499 when i first got there in 2006 there were only a few servers being monitored there was only a limited amount of historical graphing we were flying blind
798500 we were being told of problems by our customers instead of knowing about server issues ourselves

798508 we are definitely looking forward to groundworks ultimate goal of upgrading and installing a new rpm and that being it
798509 were not just announcing a new version but fundamentally changing the way we package and sell
798510 red hat is not just selling the technology but differentiating on the basis of the licensing model
798511 the advanced platform is clearly targeted at encouraging proliferation of red hat within the enterprise and reducing barriers to adoption caused by complexity of negotiating licensing agreements thats a positive move although it ignores the reality in most organisations that there is going to be a mix of environments
798512 theyve taken their time and i think theyve done a good job
798513 in less than three years groundwork has established an irrefutable leadership position in open source systems and network management offering a viable and compelling open source alternative to proprietary it monitoring solutions
798514 we invested because there is a tremendous untapped market opportunity in the mid market for groundworks solution and their seasoned management team is ideally poised to capitalise on this opportunity

798518 the companies weve aligned ourselves with are doing the acquiring
798519 the scary thing is when youre at the other end of the spectrum then youre at the mercy of whos doing the acquiring
798520 private equity firms and larger software companies are awash in cash
798521 does microsoft provide the internal support to create an excellent enterprise architecture program
798522 the notion that gpl3 is dead on arrival is false
798523 its very rare that a software project will go through the trouble and expense of cutting a new version just for a new licence typically what weve heard is that the next version they cut they will go with gpl3
798524 we get 250 world class developers and pay nothing for them it allows us to build a better engine but not a car
798525 manufacturers generally view the midmarket as channel led which offers them the benefit of expanding their coverage model while lowering their selling costs
798526 it is a bit of a perfect storm in that it is not competitive with the manufacturers the volume of accounts is significant and there are strong financial incentives available to the channel partners from the vendors
798527 hp is by far our biggest partner and this is no way a slam against hp
798528 its simply our way of extending our market reach to areas hp software cant play in for whatever reasons whether they are too big too robust too complex or not cost effective
798529 with groundwork we have a low entry point it doesnt necessarily compete against hp because its business we werent going to necessarily win anyway
798530 our enterprise expertise allows us to provide more robust and effective solutions scaled to customers needs
798531 we have a definite advantage over those moving up the value chain in situations where experience and knowledge are important to the project

798536 plata o desigur orice fel de plata care implica bancile insemna transfer al banilor dintr un cont in altul
798537 we invested because there is a tremendous untapped market opportunity in the mid market for groundworks solution
798538 it means a business executive can get a simpler view of how a few key services are operating while the network administrator can still have a dashboard that shows a more detailed view of network performance
798539 there are three layers to it management software basic monitoring systems that tell you somethings wrong and then recommend what to do and policy based actions systems that automatically correct problems
798540 the established vendors talk a lot about the top two layers but in a lot of cases are still just delivering the basic monitoring open source is a wake up call for them to deliver on the two upper layers
798541 promote protect and standardise linux by providing unified resources and services needed for open source to successfully compete with closed platforms
798542 whats unique is that the folks that are part of it represent a number of criti8cal applications for the enterprise all based on open source
798543 we look specifically for alliances where there is potential to open lines of communication from a software standpoint
798544 the open source world is nascent compared to the proprietary world and anything we can do to enhance our offering has to be good were small players compared to some but were the movers and shakers of open source applications and we have an interest in making this work

798575 nagios is an extremely useful tool for cost effective network monitoring but a lot of people dont know how to use it effectively
798576 since the book covers a range of topics that are geared towards both the new user and those who want to take nagios a step further im hoping that it will allow more people to start taking advantage of the project to monitor and problem solve in their it environment
798577 groundwork makes it possible for enterprise level organizations to save money and energy by utilizing open source for their ever changing it infrastructure monitoring and management needs
798578 by melding several best of breed open source projects including rrdtool syslog ng and mysql along with homegrown open source projects groundwork offers a customizable flexible and centralized monitoring solution for the entire it infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of the proprietary big 4 solutions hp openview ibm tivoli ca unicenter and bmc patrol
798579 being able to develop a profile to monitor mom was an extension to that and well fold that back in
798580 a little over half are somewhat predisposed to open source for a number of reasons one of those is cost but equally many of those customers have a need to extend any offering that they would purchase
798581 we recently extended the product for two customers to include high performance cluster monitoring software ganglia creating a plug in to ganglia and nagios
798582 once that is fully tested well give that back to the nagios project
798583 i believe our next progression from there is in the area of itil and configuration management database as well as service desk
798584 the level of open source integration that unisys has been able to achieve with oasis is impressive
798585 the reach and expertise that unisys has will continue to propel the mainstream adoption of open source it operations management and we are pleased to be a part of this movement
798586 with their roots in open standards and the economic fundamentals of open source operations management tools that build on quality open source projects are providing a cost effective flexible and highly configurable alternative for infrastructure monitoring
798587 the integration of groundwork monitor professional into the unisys oasis suites puts unisys in a singular position to offer the functionality enterprises demand in an attractive cost savings model with the backing of a mission critical provider of a full range of open source offerings
798588 whats exciting is that interested people can meet and explore issues in the field itself as well as the possibilities of their own technology and the technology of others
798589 this next meeting is focused around mapping out the monitoring space it will be a kind of show and tell of monitoring tools that will give attendees a chance to champion or rant about monitoring projects that have had experience with
798590 open sources most successful historical examples red hat and jboss both generated substantial early revenues in their respective operating system and application server markets
798591 groundwork has emerged as the only commercial open source vendor in the it operations management space that has generated substantial revenue and is clearly the most legitimate threat to the incumbent big 4 proprietary vendors
798592 growth of our customer base the number of monitored devices and the complexity of custom monitors required to ensure availability of the applications we support forced us to look for alternatives
798593 we monitor thousands of points with unique alerts and response rules groundworks consolidated monitoring framework increases our efficiency and enables us to focus on application availability instead of managing the monitors it integrates open source tools we trust into a complete solution equal to or better than other products in a higher price range
798594 there are certain criteria that play into the vendor partners we pursue from both a technology and business side
798595 if were going to stand behind a technology we need to make sure it stands up on its own is it flexible can it scale at the same time we are laser focused on providing our customers a superior yet cost effective solution groundwork satisfies all of these issues that are so important to us while providing solid domain expertise that we can leverage with our customers
798596 before the creation of these tools the only people that could reap the benefits of long term historical statistics gathering were people with multimillion dollar budgets mrtg and rrdtool democratized and therefore popularized historical data collection as a result network utilization planning has gone from being guesswork to a fine art these tools have also been leveraged to track a wide array of resources ranging from disk i o stats to cpu and memory usage to license server data thanks to tobias dave and their team system and network administrators are no longer limited to fire fighting when our resources are overloaded we can now easily access network and system data in an intuitive form to predict and plan for upgrades months in advance

798632 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story
798633 we want you decently dressed when you come in here
798634 you dont have to live your life the way other people expect you to
798635 the world is waiting for you to figure out what only you can contribute take as much time as you need to find the answer and then get started on it
798636 if you really want to hear about it the first thing youll probably want to know is where i was born and what my lousy childhood was like and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me and all that david copperfield kind of crap but i dont feel like going into it if you want to know the truth
798637 it should be a reminder to all of us that we have doors little and big ones which we ought to shut
798638 we will respond to critical issues in two to four hours and typically resolve them within 24 hours
798639 groundwork makes it possible for organizations to tap into the power of open source and to stop writing big checks for their network and it monitoring needs
798640 by providing a platform thats optimized for production it environments we take the heavy lifting out of the open source equation for hundreds of customers that means not only low cost but also low maintenance and enterprise class support and features that can withstand even the most rigorous mission critical environments
798641 the combination of sun and mysql means quicker access t
798642 what i told my department was i dont think we should be good at fixing things i think we should be good at not making them break
798643 we could not afford hp openview and applications like it that were 100 000
798644 for 100 000 i would want no downtime but with those applications our machines would still break
798645 over the last three years we had evolved from an old mainframe system to a more complex server based environment we changed our oses erp packages changed pretty much everything we did
798646 were a big hp customer so we had a look at openview but the price seemed to grow and grow with each meeting it also appeared as though it would have taken a small army to run it and thats something we were trying to avoid
798647 groundwork had this idea to take an open source project like nagios and turn it into a company we are an smb with our own small staff we wanted to know that our monitoring and metrics were going to be outsourced to groundwork
798648 we had some custom work and we basically wanted one off views so groundwork worked it up in conjunction with the manager that runs that for me
798649 about 90 of the functionality of applications like openview for a tenth of the cost
798650 what i told my department was i dont think we should be good at fixing things i think we should be good at not making them break
798651 we could not afford hp openview and applications like it that were 100 000
798652 for 100 000 i would want no downtime but with those applications our machines would still break
798653 over the last three years we had evolved from an old mainframe system to a more complex server based environment we changed our oses erp packages changed pretty much everything we did

798657 about 90 of the functionality of applications like openview for a tenth of the cost
798658 since its release as an rpm installation package in march thousands of people have downloaded and installed groundwork monitor open source and the accompanying demand for groundwork on linux distributions has been phenomenal
798659 the public build makes it possible for any linux user to build groundwork monitor open source broadening the reach of our solution to a much wider audience in addition were providing developers with the freedom to look under the hood of the platform and customize it with an openness that they could never experience with a proprietary solution
798660 groundwork makes it possible for organizations to tap into the power of open source and to stop writing big checks for their network and it monitoring needs
798661 by providing a platform thats optimized for production it environments we take the heavy lifting out of the open source equation for hundreds of customers that means not only low cost but also low maintenance and enterprise class support and features that can withstand even the most rigorous mission critical environments
798662 with groundwork monitor professional we have the data and tools to fine tune alarms and notifications
798663 as a long time customer ive seen the continued evolution of the product and this latest release with new dashboard and reporting capabilities will make it much easier for us to exceed the slas we have with our customers
798664 growth of our customer base the number of monitored devices and the complexity of custom monitors required to ensure availability of the applications we support forced us to look for alternatives
798665 we monitor thousands of points with unique alerts and response rules groundworks consolidated monitoring framework increases our efficiency and enables us to focus on application availability instead of managing the monitors it integrates open source tools we trust into a complete solution equal to or better than other products in a higher price range
798666 mentora has taken a leadership role as a managed service provider msp recognizing the value of open source based approaches
798667 as a result they can pass on savings to their customers while still providing extremely reliable service the msp market is going to be substantial for open source and mentora is at the cutting edge
798668 we started seeing real innovation in open source projects that handle infrastructure monitoring
798669 initially the company took some of those open source projects and on a customer by customer basis would configure them to meet the needs of each individual customer
798670 the other half pay for a turnkey services offering in which we do much more including train staff
798671 we recently published our build process less than a month ago
798672 the sweet spot initially was customers who couldnt afford higher end proprietary systems but now that customers understand open source between were not only competing on price although our customers do pay only about 20 to 30 percent of the price of proprietary software
798673 people in situations like that can come to a company like groundwork
798674 we can build a profile to monitor their app and other tech savvy companies would be happy to do it for them
798675 we figure well meet the needs of 80 of the base market the other 20 need openview and tivoli for the rest of the market which cant afford that price anyway we can meet their needs
798676 customers are better educated about linux and know that the cost of maintaining linux hardware is significantly cheaper than anything else
798677 the great thing about linux for us is that we never have to sell the benefits of linux smbs know the value of the platform
798678 the openness of linux is a key factor in our success with selling and implementing it
798679 the vast majority want windows solutions but some are looking for a platform that doesnt suck them into expensive licensing fees and software updates
798680 most customers want solutions that solve business problems the underlying technology is of secondary importance to them
798681 we are in a unique position to offer businesses the first open source based system and service management solution aimed directly at meeting the functionality requirements of demanding enterprises whilst slashing software license spend
798682 for users this means a much quicker time to value and a far lower total cost of ownership the opportunity to disrupt the economics of it systems and service management is an exciting one for it departments resellers and service providers
798683 we are in a unique position to offer businesses the first open source based system and service management solution aimed directly at meeting the functionality requirements of demanding enterprises whilst slashing software license spend
798684 for users this means a much quicker time to value and a far lower total cost of ownership the opportunity to disrupt the economics of it systems and service management is an exciting one for it departments resellers and service providers
798685 the combination of sun and mysql means quicker access t
798686 i joined groundworks open source council because they are the only vendor with concrete ideas about how to support our efforts to make the worlds best open source enterprise monitoring system while keeping ganglia completely independent and free to develop as our community wishes
798687 a group of developers of this breadth and depth in it tools has never been assembled before
798688 with their help groundwork will continue to advance the cutting edge in open source based it operations management the council both assures and insures our customers that groundwork will always be comprised of the very best open source projects comprehensively integrated into a platform thats easy to use and optimized for their it environments
798689 nine out of every 10 german local authorities are using open source software
798690 groundwork is in a unique position to offer businesses the first open source based system and service management solution aimed directly at meeting the functionality requirements of demanding enterprises at a magnitude less cost
798691 for users this means a much quicker time to value and a far lower total cost of ownership the opportunity to disrupt the economics of it systems and service management is an exciting one for it departments resellers and service providers
798692 from our intent it would be an ideal world if we could have all the expertise behind these projects as employees of groundwork
798693 we were invited to join the omc and were still looking at that
798694 we were pulling english ivy amp holly from just south of the north ballparks
798695 almost like teenagers who believe theyre invulnerable to dying in a drunk driving accident
798696 at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
798697 when youre trying to put together an open source system for monitoring your network you have a very rich field to choose from
798698 whats really exciting today is that all of these disparate best of breed solution creators are starting to really come together to explore whats possible when their technologies are interoperating with each other were sort of entering the next phase of the open source based approach to network monitoring and its great that all these creators are in close dialogue with each other
798699 for these new partners well help them find deals in their area
798700 customers are tired of the one size fits all big four approach to it operations management
798701 by bringing open source it monitoring to the channel we believe the groundwork partner network will benefit a large number of the channels mid market customers as proprietary alternatives are too complex and too expensive
798702 we have made a significant investment in a partner program that gets vars and systems integrators up to speed quickly and provides tremendous revenue upside
798703 because groundwork is open source and because of the way that its designed it gives e4e the ability to easily customize each installation to our customers unique business requirements
798704 customers are tired of the one size fits all big 4 approach to it operations management and were getting a tremendous response to the groundwork approach from our customer base
798705 there are certain criteria that play into the vendor partners we pursue from both a technology and business side
798706 if were going to stand behind a technology we need to make sure it stands up on its own is it flexible can it scale at the same time we are laser focused on providing our customers a superior yet cost effective solution groundwork satisfies all of these issues that are so important to us while providing solid domain expertise that we can leverage with our customers
798707 as were involved in a number of open source integration and installation projects oftentimes simultaneously we need solutions that are easy to implement while meeting the business and it requirements of our customers
798708 groundworks it infrastructure and network monitoring solution takes care of all the heavy lifting usually associated with open source installation configuration and management at a fraction of the cost of the large proprietary alternatives
798709 there have been more than 2 000 installations of groundwork open source since its public release less than six months ago
798710 being named one of the finalists in a prestigious linux journal award is a great validation for the code that so many groundwork and open source community leaders have contributed to groundwork intends to keep extending the feature sets and value of our open source version and continue contributing innovation back to the open source it operations community
798711 for these new partners well help them find deals in their area
798712 customers are tired of the one size fits all big four approach to it operations management
798713 network management has been evolving away from managing the network on a component or device level to managing it as a delivery system for application services
798714 the network team is being called upon to troubleshoot and prevent application performance problems because the network touches applications and applications can be scattered across a distributed network in pieces
798715 there will be a lot more adoption because a big dog in infrastructure has said wan optimization and acceleration is a good thing
798716 well the work is already getting done why should i pay 16 000 to a company when im not paying that today and everything seems to be working fine
798717 we write a utility that looks at a flat file of snmp traps gathered by polling snmp devices develop plug ins to monitor servers from nagios alarm processing and theres a project for performance monitoring that also stores its data in a flat file with these you have three pieces of information about an infrastructure but the data isnt correlated and these dont talk to each other
798718 we create an integration layer that takes all the data normalizes it stores it in a consistent database mysql and then we create a portal framework and graphical user interface utilities which allow an it administrator to graphically configure the hosts they want to monitor and they can get graphical representation of host uptime or downtime they can click on a host and get cpu utilization all in an integrated way and all from very innovative but disparate open source projects
798719 a typical installation for a midmarket customer is 20 to 30 percent of the cost of an openview or ibms tivoli that is a significant cost savings for an organization that needs much of that same functionality
798720 for example as the cio of a large midmarket company i might want to get the health status of a certain group of servers responsible for back office processes or a group of servers responsible for financial information with version 5 i can create a dashboard that just shows those aspects accessible via a web browser
798721 when a man is capable of being in uncertainties mysteries doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason
798722 being in uncertainties mysteries doubts without any irritable reaching for fact and reason
798723 god does not expect us to submit our faith to him without reason but the very limits of our reason make faith a necessity
798724 i think we will continue to see linux as the preferred environment to deploy open source based applications
798725 there is a perfect correlation between the percentage of linux based solutions sold and the relative profitability of those solutions
798726 the more experience they have with linux and the greater percentage of linux in their business the more profitable they are
798727 were targeting the m in smb small and medium sized businesses
798728 there are parts of systems management such as event monitoring and change management that are mature and ripe to be commoditised and there are opportunities to build things that plug into platforms
798729 for network managers it doesnt necessarily matter if youre open source or not its how you get the spaghetti to work together
798730 now we are all here in the presence of god to listen
798731 well kick start partners and provide field marketing funds and were flipping them initial deals
798732 there must be more than this spirit of god come breathe within
798733 god i know theres a lot of money in this world and that you control it please find a way to get some of it to dave and i right now because we really need it
798734 we want a few high quality guys to join with us and we will allow them to provide the model to other people and expand from there
798735 they have a lot of dedicated resources and thats a critical component to the partnership
798736 i think the steps they have taken have been beneficial for their customers as well as their partner community in small companies its always a people issue and you have to have the right people for the job
798737 holy father protect them by the power of your name the name you gave me so that they might be one as we are one
798738 my prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one
798739 may they be brought into complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you love me
798740 i have made you known to them and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that i myself may be in them
798741 come out from among them this world and its systems of religion and be separate
798742 the whole world is under the control of the evil one
798743 whoever is a friend of this world is the enemy of god father great spirit creator
798744 will destroy those who are destroying his creation earth air water creatures truth love peace
798745 whoever lives and believes in me his teachings and life example shall never die
798746 experience the messiah and the power that raised him from among the dead
798747 the whole world is under the control of the evil one
798748 of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience

798756 were past the point in time where we have to say well i wont get fired if i buy cisco or i wont get fired if i buy microsoft i think that fear has gone away and open source has matured a great deal so that now people are no longer afraid of it
798757 there is definitely more interest among smbs in linux and other open source solutions
798758 these applications have always offered cost savings over traditional proprietary solutions and are now also gaining sufficient ease of use integration and support to make them more viable options for smbs
798759 paul a servant of christ jesus called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of god
798760 reporting is one of the features in management products that you can never have enough of customers need to get real time historical trend analysis and business impact data in their reporting
798761 if groundwork wants to be a total management provider it will continue to flesh out the product to provide tools that will help deliver the right data to the right people
798762 come near to god and he will come near to you
798763 these are the sons of zadok who are the only levites who may draw near to the lord to minister before him
798764 the cost of end user monitoring is hard to justify for some companies
798765 you could monitor anything and everything but there is a cost associated with that a better approach is to start with the top mission critical applications for the business
798766 companies that focus on the fewest applications to start with are the most successful
798767 the pilot program should start with two or three applications when the company has a good handle on managing those applications they can expand it
798768 with any monitoring product if you cant use the information the tool will turn into shelfware
798769 most companies fail to understand the effort needed to design implement and complete a business service monitoring project
798770 most do not have the skill set to do this and do not realize they may be several years from creating the expertise needed companies are much better off engaging help to implement the initial program and getting the training necessary to maintain the project once it is in production
798771 when end user monitoring tools are correctly configured they provide the most direct indication of the performance of the business service
798772 ultimately what matters is the success or failure of the consumer to conduct business
798773 you would never run any kind of business without being able to observe your customers and take action based on what happens to them whether positive or negative the web makes that even more critical because you are never face to face with that customer their complete interaction with you is online
798774 fault management is well accepted but some companies need help seeing performance management as a requirement beyond fault
798775 systems that are fault tolerant still experience performance issues that require attention similarly performance of the elements of the system or the system as a whole does not describe the performance delivered to end users which matters most
798776 organizations can often tell you the fan speed of a server but not whether or not a customer can log into the system
798777 whether you can get to a web server and back is not always as relevant as whether you can get to the web server and then access the backend systems that support the transaction all the way through
798778 the best indication of how the application is performing for the end user is to measure response times
798779 the network server and application components of response time are the most important metrics to monitor
798780 companies have been sold on the idea of customer experience online equating solely to speed of delivery such as site response time when in fact the performance of a website from the consumer perspective is made up of far more than just speeds and feeds
798781 the same harris interactive survey i referred to earlier identified what really matters to the user security ability to complete a transaction and receiving a confirmation upon purchase web page download speed was important to only 3 of the people surveyed

798822 in 2006 groundwork truly disrupted the economics of how organizations acquire network and infrastructure monitoring solutions
798823 by integrating best of breed open source technologies weve finally given the market a way to circumvent the incredibly expensive closed source proprietary solutions that have held them hostage for so long as a result groundwork has secured the largest customer installed base of any vendor in our category and the demand for our product is showing no signs of slowing down
798824 it just didnt make sense to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on one of those complex proprietary solutions with all the bells and whistles that we wouldnt even use
798825 we realized that we could get exactly what we needed out of groundwork monitor professional plus its reassuring to now have the option of looking at the source code i can get under the hood and see whats going on if theres a problem the big proprietary tools simply do not provide that option
798826 more and more organizations are seeing the economic disruption of open source and the benefits that groundwork brings to the table
798827 groundwork monitor small business opens up an additional segment of the market for us fitting right in between our free open source edition and our professional edition which is targeted at mid market organizations
798828 thomas is another great addition to a groundwork engineering team whose product has already won more than 130 customers in less than two years
798829 craigs proven vision in architecture design and technical leadership along with his experience working on mission critical applications will continue to keep groundworks product at the forefront of innovation
798830 open source is where the real innovation is happening in it systems management today so its exciting to join the company thats leading the charge said thomas
798831 by leveraging and enhancing open source projects to be more consumable for business groundwork is effectively disrupting the economics of an it management space historically dominated by large proprietary vendors offering extremely expensive solutions
798832 groundwork monitor can help you manage networks systems applications and databases for a fraction of the cost of a big suite or framework while providing the support you associate with those solutions
798833 one of the things europe needs to do is reassert its ownership of open source
798834 i think europe needs to reassert itself as the business center for europe
798835 silicon valley has funded the next round of open source and were not necessarily the better for it
798836 there is an ethos in the projects and start ups that emerged from the social democracies of europe that one doesnt necessarily find in the capitalism spawned companies
798837 the us will continue to churn out exceptional open source projects and companies fine but thats no reason for europe to relocate to silicon valley and abandon its former leadership its time for vcs to stop insisting that their portfolio companies relocate to the valley
798838 we fundamentally believe that open source is a new distribution model but it is also a new software development model that is here to stay
798839 we anticipate its going to be very hard going forward to invest in closed source because we dont think its a good development model
798840 we dont see this as a space were not calling this a category we think this is an integral part of the industry today
798841 customers are saying im going to try it before i buy it ill try it and if it does what you say it should do then well think about having a conversation about paying for it
798842 we expect to invest in open source but not because it is open source but because we expect it to be part of every software company in the future
798843 just by open sourcing and reusing models it makes the process more efficient
798844 ultimately these open source companies have to prove that they can build brands they can sell and they can build profitable companies i dont think there are many companies yet who can do that and prove the theoretical benefits of open source
798845 open source is disrupting the economics of it operations management tools
798846 with groundwork monitor professional companies can access these open source technologies in a plug and play architecture that makes the installation and configuration easier than it is for most off the shelf proprietary monitoring solutions you no longer have to be a technical whiz in open source to enjoy the innovation thats being driven by the community and the cost savings are tremendous
798847 people describe open source innovation as a new phenomenon in networking but really its been in the deep engineering parts of the network for a very long time
798848 by providing an integrated and extensible platform that takes care of all the heavy lifting usually associated with open source installation configuration and management groundwork is allowing organizations to tap directly into the power of open source with all the enterprise class performance and functionality that they would expect of an expensive proprietary solution
798849 network weathermap is a perl tool that displays in a visual way the utilization of the network links of your network the required data are acquired from graphs created by the mrtg package and are displayed as two ways colored arrows on a map representing the logical topology of the network the resulted image is presented in a web page using extra dhtml and javascript code for web over pop ups based on the overlib javascript library
798850 customers are always changing and adopting new applications s ome have thousands and thousands of services and they just cant get their hands around how many servers they actually have deployed or the functional relationships between servers
798851 with open source projects we can sometimes get seduced by their promise and skim over the effort it takes to get it all to work together the license issues for dozens of applications included in a particular stack or even the complexities of mixing open source with proprietary and commercial software
798852 often different teams groups or divisions are using very different sets of open source solutions large companies often dont know where it is how its used or what license it is under
798853 java is more advanced than i think any other open source software in terms of compatibility testing the availability of testing suites and other things like that
798854 they perhaps may want all the features of an hp openview or an ibm tivoli but simply cant afford the price tag
798855 lower end commercial products may not have the comprehensive coverage for these folks so thats the target
798856 i think its really interesting to consider the consolidation that will likely take place in the systems management realm in the next year over the last couple of years theres been an explosion of vendors with dynamic server provisioning capabilities opsware cassatt platform data synapse levanta egenera qlusters bladelogic etc etc the environment is ripe for acquisitions and cisco is one of the looming giants thats up to the task to me the question is not if cisco will continue to beef up its systems management capabilities but when they will officially acknowledge that they intend to compete head to head with the tivolis openviews etc of the world as highly distributed applications become normalized in enterprise the value of intelligence in the network keeps getting more compelling for enterprise customers
798857 if cisco does focus its strategy on open standards that will let users pick the best management tools
798858 people are using vms in tandem with physical hardware and that reality presents management challenges on a number of levels while xensource has the xen optimizer to manage xen and vmware has virtualcenter and vmotion neither can manage the other in addition neither can manage non virtualized machines and further complicating the matter the management tools from the non virtualized distributions are going to be different from how an organization will want to manage their vms technologies like yast yum and red hat network can provide content for a virtual container but do nothing for portability so the problem is very few of the management approaches out there today take into account the idea that people will want to move their virtual machines around wherever they want to or in some cases flip between the virtual world and the physical world the challenge is being able to move the virtual container from a rack to a blade to a box or from a development environment to a production environment
798859 the interopnet demonstrates how open source can be included as a component of a collaborative network management and monitoring strategy
798860 customers who choose open source solutions need to understand how they integrate with other monitoring and management solutions so thats what weve really emphasized
798861 theres no question that this is the ultimate battle ground if your solution can stand up to the extreme interoperability requirements of the interopnet it can handle anything were honored to participate and were looking forward to interacting with the networking professionals in attendance and demonstrating why enterprises cant afford not to pay attention to open source network and infrastructure monitoring technologies

798870 we express our deep sympathies to the family of benjamin and pray that god will give them comfort in this time of sorrow
798871 we said prayers for them both at services this morning
798872 we were deeply impressed by the work that we saw at the working class studio booth at the 2006 new york gift show
798873 it was a tight turnaround about nine months from the projects inception to the items being in stores
798874 i think our customers will respond to the sophisticated yet approachable designs
798875 i like these products because they appeal to more than one group of our customers i believe we will sell this product to all age groups and interests
798876 as groundwork continues to support open source management and monitoring tools with enterprise level features and functionality our development efforts are being led by some of the best engineering talent in the industry
798877 stuart brings a proven track record in product development and a deep insight into the market drivers and requirements for open source adoption
798878 groundwork is tackling a very exciting market opportunity so its no wonder that the company is attracting so many new employees
798879 by extending the feature sets reliability and ease of use of innovative open source projects groundwork is making the power of open source it operations management more consumable for enterprise
798880 groundwork and novell understand customers demonstrated need for powerful but cost effective tools for managing it infrastructure working together we are delivering practical and affordable open source solutions that change the economics of it operations management
798881 companies are ready to adopt open source software into the core of their operations
798882 by combining open source innovation with our worldwide ecosystem we can provide customers with the benefit of open source innovation and the peace of mind to implement and deploy these solutions with confidence

798884 you should think hard about whether you set the warning limit in the net snmp or in the nagios configuration
798885 the biggest difference between computational clusters and run of the mill it systems management is that with clusters youre looking at parallel systems where local failures have a wide effect
798886 with systems like mail you tend to have redundancy so if one server goes down the load goes to another and you dont have a job failure thats not the case with clustering where theres so much interconnectivity between the nodes and if one fails you tend to lose the job when there s a failure in a cluster which can happen on a daily or hourly basis if youre running thousands of machines you need to know about it right away
798887 the low level monitor in the cluster can use multicast or unicast and then it distributes the clusters statuses using xml
798888 so you can have your local monitoring domains and then link them all together by pulling the xml streams together
798889 massive change is taking place in enterprise software with an increasing number of companies turning to open source as a more flexible and affordable alternative
798890 groundwork represents an opportunity to completely redefine the economics of how companies deploy and manage it management solutions and im excited to be part of this evolution
798891 we wanted a ceo with a demonstrated record of building profitable companies and a vision for the future of open source it management ranga brings both of these attributes in spades
798892 in addition to having a proven track record in building successful enterprise software companies ranga also brings a passion for an open source approach to it management and a leadership style that is consistent with groundworks company values
798893 we took our time to find the perfect ceo for groundwork and we found him in ranga
798894 todays it environments often are made up of disparate open source and proprietary management tools each targeted for a single requirement these tools were not designed to work as part of a larger system and dont easily integrate with each other
798895 groundwork foundation provides an open source platform into which companies can integrate and extend the tools of their choice reducing the time and cost associated with managing multiple uncoordinated it monitoring and management tools
798896 there are a vast number of companies who for years have had no viable means of managing their infrastructure because traditional solutions were too expensive and too complex
798897 with groundwork monitor open source were making a basic it infrastructure monitoring solution available to everyone and with groundwork monitor professional were offering a comprehensive fully supported solution to companies with complex it operations needs and limited it resources for configuration and tuning
798898 we previewed both groundwork monitor open source and professional and are impressed with the companys innovative use of open source technology as well as its comprehensive support offering
798899 the groundwork staff is deeply knowledgeable on open source as well as it monitoring
798900 many companies want to leverage the cost advantages and flexibility of open source but they arent in a position to pick the right tools integrate and configure them fill the functionality gaps and then maintain and support them
798901 groundwork monitor professional delivers all of these things in one enterprise ready solution that is still priced at a fraction of the cost of proprietary alternatives

798903 full disclosure will breed confidence in software development just as in any other business process it is good to see palamida and groundwork fostering a debate about ip ingredients
798904 we decided to publish our ip ingredients as a direct result of assisting our customers with their own intellectual property management and compliance process
798905 but more broadly this step acknowledges that the process of developing software has changed to leverage more and more third party ip while these components may be free in some cases they are not without responsibilities we are supporting the trend to transparency by formally recognizing the contribution of commercial and open source software to our product validating that our use conforms to the conditions set by the various authors
798906 in todays world of increasing compliance requirements full disclosure and complete transparency greatly mitigate legal and technology risk giving customers the ability to confidently deploy software products across their enterprise
798907 groundwork status viewer provides substantial enhancements to the robust capabilities of nagios
798908 with groundwork status viewer the thousands of companies that rely on nagios for it monitoring now have a highly configurable and scalable user interface
798909 after testing groundwork status viewer we now anticipate deploying it into our production environment of nearly 1 700 hosts and 2 300 managed services
798910 groundwork status viewer offers a much more scalable front end for nagios giving everyone from our engineers to upper management a simple and unified view of our network
798911 the release of monarch puts us one step closer to our vision of pervasive open source it management tools
798912 with monarch we are demonstrating a commitment to supporting the growing user communities surrounding nagios and other open source it management tools
798913 system administrators are increasingly accustomed to gui based software configuration tools but nagios still requires users to edit by hand with monarchs graphical web based user interface weve bridged one of the largest functional gaps of nagios
798914 with monarchs automated profiling system system administrators can set up one profile and assign it to 2 500 devices with one command saving considerable time and avoiding human error

798917 when you go to the hospital to have an infection or a cancer excised do you want the doctors and nurses to be skilled and the instruments they use clean or are you content to have the equivalent of your teenage son or daughter using a dirty kitchen knife to cut you open on the counter
798918 to make the point in a discussion of who should be responsible for funding the health care system and the education system perhaps we should ask the following question
798919 mrs henry i dont want my daughter to go to school no more and i hear you can help me
798920 we had a meeting with ochoa to tell him we refused the offer from everton and galatasarays proposal was just unsatisfactory
798921 neither us or the player think that a loan for a player of the quality of ochoa is something serious
798922 we have not yet made a formal offer but 20m will be our limit
798923 sporting are somewhat naive in thinking about it because nobody pays in cash and we do not pay all at once
798924 i have just been told by a player who i know well that aj has failed his medical fulham now wont pay anywhere near our asking price dont know what this means to the moutinho bid said it was his knee everton trying to hush it up at the moment
798925 there is talk that sporting rejected a bid from everton now i would hope that sporting and everton have reached agreement
798926 i stayed there for three days trained three times once with the goalkeeping coach and twice with the rest of the team and the coach praised me
798927 i have been very clear since i came here there are usually rumours but my intention is always to stay and i still have three years on my contract
798928 he will not leave just for the sake of leaving only for a club with a different dimension and is good for him and sporting
798929 miguel will not leave for an average club that cannot match his expectations or surpass what miguel could do at sporting
798930 everton have dismissed reports claiming a deal to sell andrew johnson to fulham has been agreed
798931 it has gone back to gonw government office for the north west for some reason
798932 she told me that the announcement in ready to go and the reasons for the call in will be made public on the net when i asked about the phrasing she used she laughed and then repeated it
798933 i dont know if i ever told you all this
798934 should i really be risking my life every week i thought since mr bully is such an honest and admirable person i better verify his comments for him as obviously he is far too busy to do that himself bless
798935 are there any pieces of legislation or any rules coming into force to change the current situation
798936 could you imagine if a piece of legislation came in suggesting retrospective amendmants to old buildings it would be chaos
798937 sporting has no proposal nor any contact for joao moutinho and miguel veloso without offers they cannot leave they are our players
798938 the arrival of joao moutinho is a big possibility for us
798939 fighting for the poor against the evils of the new world order and globilisation
798940 i am aware of evertons interest and if the club feel it would be good for them to accept an offer i would be more than willing to make the move

798942 groundwork monitor 4 is an ideal solution for companies that want a comprehensive centralized monitoring solution that can grow with their infrastructure with groundwork monitor 4 companies benefit from the innovation cost advantage and extensibility of open source while enjoying the support and customer service associated with traditional commercial software
798943 the new architecture of groundwork monitor 4 provides the platform for a full open source it management suite and gets us closer to our vision of a totally open data center
798944 our forestry business requires a widely dispersed network and it was becoming increasingly difficult to monitor each of the sites to ensure they were up and running
798945 with groundwork monitor 4 were spending minutes rather than hours keeping tabs on the network which frees us up to focus on more strategic activities
798946 groundwork monitor represents a compelling alternative to expensive commercial monitoring solutions and a better option than unsupported open source
798947 enterprises are increasingly realizing that their needs are best met by solutions like groundwork monitor that can offer the benefits of open source software but also provide the enhancements support and services theyve grown accustomed to from traditional enterprise software providers
798948 with groundwork monitor we can monitor our infrastructure from several different points in the network we can see applications not just from the administrators vantage point but from the customers vantage point as well this distributed monitoring approach gives us a much better overall picture
798949 the best way to build an effective monitoring platform is a combination of point tools and customization
798950 groundwork has pulled the best open source tools together into a monitoring solution that can be customized to meet the specific needs of an it function
798951 with this level of visibility we can identify patterns and root causes for our customers
798952 these companies were selected based on their respective positions on the open source adoption curve
798953 we anticipate that each of them will hit a key inflection point in terms of customer adoption competitive pressure and business model refinement this year its an exciting time for them and now we will all be watching
798954 we were very pleased with this years event which continues to grow
798955 there was a tremendous amount of education about the business impact of open source and attendees also expressed that there were many excellent networking opportunities at osbc
798956 a lot of the mid market companies are under pressure to drive down the infrastructure cost and divert that money to things that are core to their business
798957 given that the trepidation regarding open source is waning very quickly for what we do
798958 theres been this movement to linux and a lot of that was to do with the allure of cheaper more powerful servers and x86 standard building blocks but when you dig into it you find that all was not well in terms of cost of management
798959 the folks that cant keep track of it look at it in terms of the number of systems administrators per server
798960 in my view the open source community has been more successful at the introduction of the technology than the management of the technology
798961 i would anticipate over time that open source vendors will get a little more focused on that
798962 in terms of systems management were not yet seeing a lot of adoption of open source management tools as yet its partly the maturity of the technology its also the common agreed standards
798963 its harder in terms of systems management because youve got a lot of existing tools there
798964 for systems management to work there needs to be more open source services
798965 data centres are unique customers already have tools and need it systems management to work with them
798966 by going open source the theory was we can get users involved to develop that integration and hire third party developers to develop that integration
798967 they all offer proprietary software that tells you how to run your network
798968 the product is certified to run on suse and red hat but it will monitor everything
798969 the beauty of the open source base we have is theres a plug in for everything if theres something that can be monitored theres certainly a plug in out there somewhere
798970 the founders cut their teeth by an outsourced service for managing network operations
798971 initially an implementation services vendor for open source combined with its own configuration and management software
798972 were squarely focused on the mid market the customers who can only afford to window shop for something like hp openview
798973 what we offer is 80 of the functionality at 20 of the cost
798974 we have no notions that were going after the fortune 500 but theres a huge group of customers who pretty much have nothing
798975 were a two year old start up and weve already crossed over the 100 paying customer mark so the market is there
798976 we have people from haifa to singapore to paris to austin to beijing were about to launch a cvs repository just for community contributions
798977 i think the success of open source will be based around how complex it is to implement the package the beauty of what were doing from a business perspective is its hard
798978 its not easy to build a management system you get some people who think they can write scripts with perl and feed that into nagios it works fine with up to 50 systems but above that it gets a bit more difficult
798979 if you are a small company stringing things together having a framework with a community of developers behind it is something thats going to be very appealing
798980 it is still a fairly significant effort for an it person to get a network monitoring tool working in their environment we did the integration work with other freeware tools to help them get started easier
798981 organizations are continually trying to move dollars from areas that are not their core competency
798982 we were invited as much to prove open source could monitor large scale networks as anyone else
798983 ca has been the monitor for 7 8 years it was a thrill for us to be next to them
798984 we built this foundation layer that took multiple data streams from various open source monitoring tools normalized the data stuck it in a database then built an ajax frame on top so you could present it and configure it with graphical tools thats been our approach thats what has taken off
798985 our outside provider actually did utilize hp openview so we were familiar with it and its agents were on our system
798986 but thats when we knew we had to invest a lot more in openview to meet our needs because we had grown to a certain business point either we could continue with hp or go to another solution ive done two hp openview implementations in the past and i was very familiar with the other top products
798987 if i did this with one of the big players it would be 300 000 just for licensing and i would have to tack on another 300 000 just on professional services
798988 the larger products are very complex and make doing the simple stuff hard
798989 so with this open source and this nagios based platform it really made the easy stuff easy i was able to start off quickly get some monitoring done and build in the complexity as i needed it
798990 ive spent hundreds of thousands of dollars post product after ive brought in software for consulting services and support and sometimes they dont even get it right it takes them a long time to customize things and then you have to fix problems as they come up its just amazing every solution no matter what you buy youre always going to have to customize them to me why not start with a lower cost solution and customize from there
798991 its like not having a ferrari you dont know what it feels like to drive one
798992 a lot of the effort has to be self directed
798993 these are by no means the packaged one stop solutions you will find from proprietary vendors it takes a more dedicated approach to finding support becoming a member of the open source community and leveraging the open source model
798994 with proprietary companies during beta release early adopters debug the code
798995 in the open source model the developers debug it by the time it gets packaged its leading edge
798996 go to venture capital sites and see the lists of companies they are funding visit
798997 our outside provider actually did utilize hp openview so we were familiar with it and its agents were on our system
798998 but thats when we knew we had to invest a lot more in openview to meet our needs because we had grown to a certain business point either we could continue with hp or go to another solution ive done two hp openview implementations in the past and i was very familiar with the other top products
798999 if i did this with one of the big players it would be 300 000 just for licensing and i would have to tack on another 300 000 just on professional services
799000 the larger products are very complex and make doing the simple stuff hard
799001 so with this open source and this nagios based platform it really made the easy stuff easy i was able to start off quickly get some monitoring done and build in the complexity as i needed it
799002 ive spent hundreds of thousands of dollars post product after ive brought in software for consulting services and support and sometimes they dont even get it right it takes them a long time to customize things and then you have to fix problems as they come up its just amazing every solution no matter what you buy youre always going to have to customize them to me why not start with a lower cost solution and customize from there
799003 its like not having a ferrari you dont know what it feels like to drive one
799004 a lot of the effort has to be self directed
799005 these are by no means the packaged one stop solutions you will find from proprietary vendors it takes a more dedicated approach to finding support becoming a member of the open source community and leveraging the open source model
799006 with proprietary companies during beta release early adopters debug the code
799007 in the open source model the developers debug it by the time it gets packaged its leading edge
799008 go to venture capital sites and see the lists of companies they are funding
799009 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
799010 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
799011 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
799012 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
799013 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
799014 the next thing to do is go to the directory which holds your settings py
799015 but this list does not replace python dev most things do benefit from public input and thus by default most discussions should be done on that list things such as new features etc should happen on python dev or even python ideas before that so that the community can contribute
799016 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
799017 the situation is better but how much better and is it real
799018 my maternal uncle is shiite and before they were unable to visit us at all now they do visit us regularly but at the same time they have to be careful not to make themselves conspicuous just in case
799019 we used to be terrified of the forces manning checkpoints because they had the authority to question us and we just didnt know which way to lie
799020 they could be anything now we fear only about 25 percent of them which we can call a development
799021 all we want is to be able to enter any neighborhood without having to make calculations walk down streets without fear be able to make new friends right now we still cant

799034 whether local or federal law inserts into the process the fact remains that without a solid basic education platform in place the student will be unable to achieve a ged or high school diploma and will consequently be locked out of higher education
799035 however for most parents who are single or require two incomes to survive homeschooling is not an option
799036 i also think it would be helpful for some home school children or parents to add descriptions of their learning process here then we would have some evidence to inform our opinions
799037 ive decided that who they are is more important than what they know
799038 still through our obligation to protect children we must require that homeschooling meet minimum requirements so that it is reasonably likely that the child will develop properly
799039 anyway as far progressive framing of the homeschool issue homeschoolers of every ilk are here to stay whether some progressives give us their approval or not

799064 even if our efforts of attention seem for years to be producing no result one day a light that is in exact proportion to them will flood the soul
799065 groundwork has already demonstrated strong customer traction in the market offering a very viable and compelling open source alternative to commercial it management solutions
799066 as enterprises continue to embrace open source for more mission critical applications we believe groundwork has the potential to capture a significant portion of the 7 billion worldwide it management market
799067 open source it management solutions offer the promise not just of lower acquisition costs but of lower deployment and management costs
799068 the challenge until recently has been monetizing open source we believe the market is now ready for companies like groundwork that take unsupported open source components and integrate them into cost effective enterprise ready applications that include enhancements support and services
799069 we partnered with groundwork to build an enterprise monitoring system and it has transformed the reputation of it within the company
799070 by leveraging open source tools with design integration and support services our customers are managing their it investments more effectively than ever before at a much lower cost
799071 with our solutions customers dont need to pay expensive commercial software prices to get excellent results
799072 we already see strong customer momentum and a compelling value proposition keeping networks up and running and optimizing network operations at a fraction of the cost of commercial software licenses
799073 groundworks founders have track records that are as impressive as ive seen with a half dozen highly successful start ups under their belts and a combined 35 years operational management experience
799074 the challenges of todays commercial it management solutions are well understood high costs inflexible commercial tools long deployment cycles vendor lock in and the list goes on open source represents a better way not only because it cuts costs by as much as 80 but also because an open architecture actually solves the inflexibility and integration problems
799075 im excited to be leading the sales effort for groundwork at a time when the industry is on the cusp of such dramatic change
799076 were excited to have phil join our team phil has a proven track record of building successful sales organizations and developing effective direct and indirect sales programs the experience he brings will greatly enhance groundworks ability to bring open source it management in to the mainstream
799077 there were many strong candidates for the red herring 100 list this year so making it onto the list is quite an achievement

799290 now anderson has confidence in himself hes the guy now we can get better together as opposed to me getting better individually now were getting better on the same page
799291 ive seen defensive linemen intercept passes before but to be a big guy like that and be able to get around the corner is something
799292 usually a big guy isnt able to get around the corner so were excited about what he brings to the table hes not there yet and were still working with him and hes working hopefully hell continue to get better as we go along
799293 we keep kind of trolling the waters but its so early everyone is kind of getting settled back in to the routine of being in training camp we made a few calls but theres nothing really imminent right now
799294 being able to bring together that circle of concerned family and friends is very powerful
799295 even though it was started here the internet instantly made it a global service it certainly has grown globally
799296 we really focus on a broad category of medical events and certainly war injuries are part of that
799297 we also have a long relationship with fisher house that started around 2001 its really helped us gain understanding with military families the different hospitals where wounded troops are taken care of and medical personnel who were treating them
799298 we didnt necessarily want anyone and everyone to be able to read about chris but wanted all of his friends and family to be able to visit the site as often as they wanted
799299 when chris first got hurt there were phone calls and e mails going everywhere and it was impossible to make sure that everyone was updated
799300 it was also a way that everyone could reach out to chris by leaving comments for him to read
799301 it kept everyone up to date on chris progress once he was able to he started to update the page himself and it was wonderful to hear from him
799302 i want people to hear his story the more people he can touch the bigger impact he can have
799303 im alive i have my arms my brain whats next
799304 i knew this could help connect people going through any of these medical events i really did
799305 that was an important motivator knowing this potential that was out there and how this could really really touch many peoples lives
799306 it has been wonderful to be able to combine that passion i have for technology to help people when they really need it most there has really been this exponential effect
799307 this is something thats out there for anybody weve really just hit the tip of the iceberg and know we can go farther
799308 i wouldnt stop defending my country until my last breath
799309 i dont think there is such a thing as a disability or something stopping you
799310 his seat is too far back its pushing into my knees
799311 the right to life the freedom from arbitrary deprivation of liberty and protection from torture

799314 88 percent of baby boomers say its important to have physicians with specialized training geared toward older patients

799319 a very big lady of quite small stature with a very wide girth
799320 these pants considering their provenance and pedigree are very exciting
799321 controversy equalizes fools and wise men in the same way
799322 although we like to think of ourselves as rational beings there are few among us who do not exhibit the two valued orientation when we are stirred up by controversy
799323 we have the peculiar fact that once people become accustomed to institutions they eventually get to feeling that their particular institutions represent the only right and proper way of doing things
799324 one of the lessons of war is that institutions while powerful and long lasting are often not insuperably rigid if the emergency is great enough
799325 the problem then the world over is to learn that the emergency is serious enough in international affairs in race relations in preserving the natural environment etc to require modifying or abandoning some of our insitutions
799326 if we as citizens of a democracy are going to carry our share in the important decisions about the things that concern us so greatly such as the problems of peace and a just world economic order we must prepare ourselves to do so by coming down out of the clouds of high level abstraction or generalized thinking and learning to consider the problems of the world whether local state national or international levels as extensionally physically acting as we now consider the everyday problems of getting food clothing and shelter
799327 miss entirely the basic requirement of understanding social problems namely the initial task of describing the established patterns of group behavior that is the instituions that constitute a society and contribute to its social problems
799328 know of any gay mens sports teams im thinking of joining one it would be fun
799329 maybe you should start with something small like table tennis

799331 if god is love and if he manifested that love in his creation of the universe and everything within it and if he created man in his image to steward the earth and its lessor creatures then mankind as individual human representations of the force we call god was created for the purpose of the self perpetuation of the love of god his representative creation of himself in human form

799365 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
799366 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

799752 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
799753 they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them

799770 it always seems to be hot and they dont ever complain about it
799771 i worry more about the heat around them then about them getting on the playground equipment and getting burned

799777 the first shot was the boat scene and the boat was so shaky that the kid started crying now we cant have a backup in the case of kids and it was finally sujit with his long hair amp beard who handled the situation
799778 we had to create an artificial storm for the last scene and the kid got so scared he started crying again finally he declared i am not interested thankfully we had shot it once which was quite a bad shot but had to be included in the final sequence
799779 they bank of india had problems which many psus have one was they did not have a brand image and the second was they basically had the older generation as their customers and very few young clients
799780 i think of our shareholders as owner partners and ourselves as managing partners we do not view the company itself as the ultimate owner of our business assets but instead view the company as a conduit through which our shareholders own the assets
799781 you could think of ron wayne kind of like the fifth beatle
799782 he had a strong association with steve jobs and steve wozniak in the beginning but was not a participant in their future success
799783 we are very happy to be able to share his story he represents a bit of history that very few people witnessed and most never knew
799784 the addition of ron wayne to the film was simple
799785 the film lives in high definition as a finalcut pro project his interview was a natural addition
799786 we are still on course for a fall delivery of the dvd which will be so much more than just the movie the hardest thing has been deciding what not to include

799794 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
799795 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
799796 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures
799797 ultimately the goal is to provide emergency managers with a range of possibilities as to what may happen as the result of a storm and this approach shows great promise
799798 were playing russian roulette in some sense with these storms coming up the coast
799799 if we have a high tide or spring high tide when we have one of these events then were in trouble
799800 the vulnerability of the area speaks for itself as weve already had cases of flooding
799801 when coupled with sea level rise its not going to take much of a storm to cause flooding as we go into the coming decades so we are working to provide better forecasting of these events in the future
799802 tnfaip3 can be thought of as a critical brake mechanism for the immune system
799803 when the gene doesnt function properly the immune system redlines
799804 we suspect that the variant either doesnt make enough of the protein or it makes a less effective protein
799805 our data adds tnfaip3 to a growing list of lupus associated genes that may help us diagnose and treat our patients
799806 every single lupus associated gene we discover is just as important as the others
799807 each gene can set off new opportunities and new projects for us you never know which gene is going to give you the best chance to develop new therapeutics or better diagnostics
799808 we also want to know exactly what effect the gene variation has on a20 protein production and function
799809 im giving up more runs but im also striking out more
799810 i told the recruiter i wanted the hardest thing out there
799811 the army provided me the opportunity to be on the first team
799812 twenty six years later that is why i am still on the first team the army offered me a better deal
799813 i dont think too many people can say they knocked him on his back and stood over him and said get up rook
799814 the most important accomplishment in my mind is when i got my college degree
799815 there is a winner and loser and god forbid we come out on the losing end in the war on terror
799816 its important that voters participate in the upcoming primary elections
799817 we have over 20 primaries occurring in february so now is the time if youve received your ballot to vote and get it back by the state deadlines
799818 absentee voters fill out a federal postcard application form to request a ballot send it into their local election official where the voter is legally authorized to vote
799819 with the calendar of primary elections beginning early and stretching through september 2008
799820 it is important that the department and the services be prepared to carry out the voting assistance mission to inform and educate u
799821 i tell you sir i love you with all of my heart
799822 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
799823 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
799824 consumer spending makes up 70 of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
799825 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
799826 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
799827 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
799828 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
799829 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
799830 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
799831 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
799832 file into their islamic studies class where the textbooks tell them the day of judgment cant come until jesus christ returns to earth breaks the cross and converts everyone to islam and until muslims start attacking jews
799833 its a sad day when you have to leave the u s to be free
799834 active duty military members are required to be apolitical as they go about their business serving the nation
799835 its a fundamental tenet that we dont engage in partisan political activity
799836 you cant have credibility as military experts if people are going to question your motives that maybe theres something here other than what is in the best interests of the country
799837 a right way and a wrong way to do that
799838 political activities by members of the armed forces on active duty
799839 john doe is a member of the army national guard use of his military rank job titles and photographs in uniform does not imply endorsement by the department of the army or the department of defense
799840 guidelines for handling dissident and protest activities among members of the armed forces
799841 giving comprehensible and appropriate information about survival benefit is extremely difficult in addition the reluctance to inform patients of the limited survival gain of palliative chemotherapy may be motivated by a desire to protect patients from bad news
799842 however the reluctance to address these difficulties and sensitivities may be hampering patients ability to make informed decisions about their future treatment
799843 flattered by the attention to my work brought by this russian state prize
799844 until the end of my life i can hope that the historical material collected by me and presented to my readers enters the consciousness and memory of my fellow countrymen
799845 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
799846 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
799847 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
799848 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
799849 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
799850 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
799851 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
799852 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
799853 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
799854 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
799855 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
799856 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
799857 and shall we comprehend even on the day of our destruction all its facets and all its possibilities
799858 he must be replaced with a candidate who understands the importance of an integrated political military and economic strategy that does not pit political ends against military and economic but synchronizes and orchestrates them with the recognition of the imperative to achieve the victory that this war demands for the safety of our children and grandchildren
799859 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
799860 our liaison officer at the base camp confirmed the death of five
799861 we dont have names of dead climbers but it has been confirmed that one dutch one norwegian and one french are in the tally of dead
799862 he who climbs mountains is half in love with the mountains and half in love with himself
799863 some obama backers are right to worry that the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
799864 its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
799865 what we have learnt this week is that when the republican attack machine cranks up as hillary clinton predicted obama is actually pretty vulnerable
799866 obama will put his face on the 100 bill mccain w video
799867 his shorts were torn and he had been bitten badly in both buttocks
799868 i am not afraid of dogs and so i stopped to let the female come up to sniff me
799869 she not only smelt me she bit me in the calf
799870 there are certain places we dont take our customers to any more to avoid any problems weve had several cases in the last two weeks alone of holidaymakers telling us about tremendous scares with patous
799871 driving already frozen north south relations into a catastrophic phase
799872 the company blamed delayed launches from handset makers for the missed target
799873 today we are in an environment where we may not need the large number or persistence of manned aircraft
799874 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
799875 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
799876 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
799877 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace
799878 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
799879 there are periods where weve gone a week to ten days without having to release a single kinetic attack and that is a real success story
799880 will we need to have manned kinetic capability to respond either with overhead or ground alert the answer is yes for a period of time
799881 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
799882 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
799883 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
799884 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
799885 the data really confirm that there is a severe impact of this epidemic among gay and bisexual men in the united states as well as black men and women
799886 we need to develop programs that specifically target those most at risk such as african americans hispanics and men who have sex with men
799887 the reality is that it is a wake up call for all of us
799888 there are things that you and i can do to stop the disease encourage others to use condoms consistently and correctly abstain from sex
799889 this improved estimate means little if it does not serve as the spark to inflame our collective anger about the deadly neglect of an acute emergency
799890 this week president bush signed a new global aids bill but persistent underfunding and restrictions here at home tie our hands in combating the epidemic in our own backyard
799891 there is hope and many disputed issues have been removed and there are guarantees for all parties
799892 loro non potranno dimostrare che lo ma io neanche posso dimostrare lopposto
799893 ha il mio permesso alessio come pure quello di ascoltare qualche mia registrazione

799896 the ruler of dubai is an important figure in the emirates and an influential figure around the world
799897 dan apakah orang yang sudah mati kemudian dia kami hidupkan dan kami berikan kepadanya cahaya yang terang yang dengan cahaya itu ia dapat berjalan di tengah tengah manusia serupa dengan orang yang keadaannya berada dalam gelap gulita yang sekali kali tidak dapat keluar dari padanya demikianlah kami jadikan orang yang kafir itu memandang baik apa yang telah mereka kerjakan

799902 setiap hari selalu ada yg mengatakan telah mati si fulan telah mati si allan
799903 dan tiada seorangpun yang dapat mengetahui dengan pasti apa yang akan diusahakannya besok dan tiada seorang pun yang dapat mengetahui di bumi mana dia akan mati sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal

799906 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
799907 i want the michigan delegation and the florida delegation to be seated and however the democratic national committee determines we can get that done im happy to abide by those rules
799908 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice
799909 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
799910 this matter will be the top priority for the credentials committee when we meet on august 24 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
799911 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
799912 you can tell the history of the environment from whats in the water
799913 the magnitude and frequency of floodings may increase because springtime flooding is usually caused by rain on snow
799914 but thats a long way down the road we have a lot to learn in the interim to plan for that
799915 the firemen are here were trying to get the electricity restored this is really horrible
799916 its unconscionable that any reasonable person would consider this an acceptable tactic to get their point across
799917 we are working hard with the other agencies and committing all available resources to follow all possible leads we urge anyone with information to come forward
799918 with what happened previously and what happened last week with the pamphlets we just assumed
799919 its terrorism as far as im concerned theyre being terrorized
799920 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
799921 these unconscionable acts put the researchers their families including their children and their neighbors in grave danger
799922 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
799923 the personal safety and security of all our students faculty and staff is our highest priority
799924 senator mccain will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign i will bring a lifetime of experience to the campaign and senator obama will bring a speech he gave in 2002 is much harsher and to the point than these ads that tease senator obama about his celebrity status
799925 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
799926 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me theyre going to say you know what hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name did i mention hes black

799940 i support same sex marriage i have for many many years i believe that a civilised society is a society that is inclusive and is a society that affords the same human rights the same access to justice the same equality under the law for every single one of its citizens
799941 we know that a huge number of labor parliamentarians state and federal support marriage equality it will only be matter of time before more come out for equality
799942 hmmm good question lets figure it out what do you think
799943 google is your friend but like all friends sometimes it stabs you in the back when you least expect it

799948 you can complain about the government and you should be able to do that without fear of retaliation or threatening actions on the part of the people in these positions
799949 i guess theyve kind of annoyed them at some level but you really dont want to see law enforcement or government resources spent in this way
799950 well i take whatever i want and baby i want you

799957 im just a guy trying to ensure the right thing gets done
799958 confident the cg is taking appropriate action within the law to investigate this matter
799959 i wanted to reply but it needed some consideration i was bogged down by work and just couldnt get around to it
799960 that was my biggest mistake i regret very much that i did not respond properly to those messages
799961 it was a popular column that had continued since the mainichi daily news was published as a printed newspaper therefore we couldnt easily decide to shut it down because we thought there are many regular readers
799962 i read the waiwai articles from time to time after they moved to the web but not all of them there were some extreme expressions but in general the column picked up stories that foreign readers interested in japan would want to read
799963 the managing editor was intent on the reform of the mainichi weekly and didnt involve himself in the mdn very much
799964 i was busy and i dont remember clearly but i think it was me who added them
799965 the successor of the government ministry that gave the world pearl harbor and the rape of nanking
799966 there were defects in the checking system there was no editorial quality control system there as a deficiency in journalistic morals
799967 when the japanese public sees something in the shukan post or jitsuwa knuckles they know its bullshit
799968 to expect rigorous fact checking like the column was reporting on real events is simply unrealistic
799969 its the very dodgy and dubious assertion that it was being taken at face value by readers that is the problem
799970 japanese not wanting certain things to be translated into english and shared with the outside world
799971 from the successor of the government ministry that gave the world pearl harbor and the rape of nanking
799972 the writers in question were disproportionately male and failed to incorporate a womans point of view

799978 my hope and expectation is that in the years ahead more african americans will staff the armed forces at the highest levels
799979 we must make sure the american military continues to be a great engine of progress and equality
799980 while blacks make up about 17 percent of the total force they are just 9 percent of all officers
799981 this program has been very successful in several new england states in identifying soldiers with readjustment problems and we are happy to expand it to new york
799982 we consider it a real privilege to be able to speak with these soldiers
799983 as with all health problems mental health issues are best dealt with early and close to home offering mental health screenings as part of the reintegration process will lead to early identification and support for those returning soldiers who are struggling to deal with the stresses of deployment and war
