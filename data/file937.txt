9370035 the last time i was stung was when i bought some whisky from an englishman whew the stuff was only good for cleaning the mould from my binoculars and starting a fire on a cold morning

9370043 i was in sumatera looking for suitable wood for the production of some mammoth plate cameras at my workshop
9370044 being in no position to negotiate i made the best of things and agreed wholeheartedly the chief nodded and the pearl of his eye was brought to me i tell you sherlock she was a sight wearing only a braided straw skirt she looked like a light brown venus he figure was as tasty as this sandwich in fact she would chase and catch the giant rats for fun so you can imagine her physical condition
9370045 i set up the tripod in a shaded spot with some soft light from the side of her to sculpt that gorgeous face and mischevious eyes into soft glowing curves those bright eyes gave me a look i recognized in any language i quickly took out my trusty goerz 8 double anastigmat series iii wonderbeast dagor and set to work before i was er distracted
9370046 i retired to the dark tent with the few glass plates of i had of her
9370047 we set our packs up the next morning getting ready for the journey home when the chief came to me with my guide he pointed to a hut at the corner of the clearing the guide explained that we could take all the contents of the hut if we so desired i wandered over and took a look inside there were piles of tropical cameras all in mint condition of which i am selling a few here today so take a look at my other listings there were lenses of all sorts mostly zeiss which resulted in the death of their users the bearers took up the equipment and we made our way out of the clearing back to the trail the chiefs daughter smiled coyly at me as i left and i gave her a wink and a smile when i returned to scotland a few years later i found a solid looking crate waiting for me upon opening it i found several smoked rats wrapped in dried leaves and a picture it was the chiefs daughter with a lightly coloured baby in her arms she was looking at the camera with a very contented smile i get a crate like that every three years so eat up holmes theres plenty more and for a bit of goerz info we come to this chart take a look at lens 8 quite the beast in coverage i tell yah and since its an f7 7 its pretty darn compact too but i bet a fair number of you are asking why this lens has multi coating on it well ill tell you why i had this lens sent back to the uk for re polishing re cementing and coating all in all it took over four years between one thing or another its a great piece of glass and one ive had a lot of fun using i actually used it before i had the work done and since as well the image is about 1 3 1 2 grade higher in contrast no doubt thanks to the coating and polishing the glass has gone through along the way though two iris blades have been dinged and i had to remove them before they broke some of the good ones no doubt this lens will be popped in a shutter so im not too worried about that however if you do plan to use the iris in the lens youll have a maximum stopped down size of 16 1 2 as a small space shows up between the blades that will cause a secondary image like a pinhole camera would you can always replace the iris too if you want check the optical department of edmunds scientific recently i looked into an iris for another dagor and it was 60 this being a larger lens will probably need one about 70 80 all the fittings screws retaining ring hardware is still in the barrel i can make out a couple of fine cleaning wisps that have no effect on performance whatsoever the barrel has remnants of the original paint to it presently i dont have caps or flange i used a lens iris with it at the time but ill sniff around in my box o

9370433 the league tables are a total nightmare they put untold pressure on teachers to make sure their pupils not only pass but pass well
9370434 if a young person is not looking like doing well often it is seen as in the best interest of the school for her or him not to turn up
9370435 it is particularly galling as the school has already paid the entrance fee so there is no real reason for the pupil not to just have a bash thats what would have happened in the old days and it didnt do anyone any harm
9370436 it does look as if the results do not include those candidates who are failing themselves
9370437 the exam boards ought to be explicit about the basis of the statistics and point out what is and is not being included there have been rumours for some time now that the pressure of league tables is putting pressure for only the best children to actually sit the exams
9370438 after supposedly studying a subject for two years many people will question why so many of these youngsters failed to take the exam
9370439 there must be a real concern that some schools could be withdrawing pupils from their exams late in the day in order to make their overall results look better
9370440 it is important that we do not set young people up to fail but once they have enrolled on a course every effort should be made to ensure that they complete it
9370441 a second post mortem will take place before the results are released
9370442 we are taking this seriously there have been a string of calls about sightings
9370443 police in north belfast are warning the public to be aware of sightings of what appears to be a lion in the upper hightown end of cavehill park
9370444 police are currently responding to the incident and would urge the public to avoid the area
9370445 clearly we will be seeking to establish whether it is the body of christopher foster
9370446 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals

9370470 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
9370471 we will have to see what the scan shows tomorrow
9370472 we will have to see the extent of the injury if it is like steven gerrards it could be 10 to 15 days and he may only miss one game we will just keep our fingers crossed that it is nothing too serious
9370473 the situation has not changed at all the negotiations are continuing and i still wish to leave madrid i want to play for chelsea
9370474 the president and pedja mijatovic said they will let me leave but schuster doesnt because he has promised to make me feel comfortable again if he thinks that its his problem i dont want to stay at real madrid
9370475 the behaviour of chelsea officials who despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player have continued to make gestures and statements and have even sold the players shirt on its official website all this has done nothing but aggravate the situation and confuse public opinion
9370476 there is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player so we completely refute any criticism from real madrid
9370477 as for the issue regarding the website real are well aware this was a regrettable accident by an external supplier which was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention and not a single shirt was sold
9370478 calderon said that if a good offer came in they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort to sign me
9370479 my agent has gone a thousand times to talk to the club and the club has shown no interest in me staying now as the club hasnt signed anyone its in their interest for me to stay
9370480 john mccain is trying to tell the american people i got it ive picked somebody that knows how to fix government ive picked somebody that will stand up to powerful people in her own backyard and together were going to change this place
9370481 compared to barack obama i think she would make one hell of a commander in chief
9370482 mccains chosen somebody that has zero zero experience in foreign policy
9370483 the first threshold test of a president of a nominee is choosing a vice president is to prove to the american people that the person that you have chosen can fill in tomorrow
9370484 im not attacking her i think john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because he has chosen somebody who clearly does not meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9370485 shes been a governor shes been in charge of the national guard what has senator obama done in terms of managing a war his judgment when it comes to matters of war had been terrible
9370486 shes been a governor shes been in charge of the national guard what has senator obama done in terms of managing a war
9370487 i shot myself in the butt now where is my purple heart
9370488 compared to barack obama i think she would make one hell of a commander in chief

9370490 he also made official trips to eastern europe the middle east and africa
9370491 can you imagine biden and 0 bama debating on foreign policy
9370492 i have a feeling deep inside mccain regrets chosing her

9370494 jo like a certain part of the human body opinions are like that everone has one and yours is yours only
9370495 the serious concern about these emails is that they were prohibited from being released to the public due to executive privilege even though todd palin was copied on these same emails todd palin is not a member of the executive branch nor is he even a government employee todd palin is a member of the general public

9370514 basically everyday i look at the schedule to see where i have to be
9370515 the thing im going to miss probably more in this center were more centrally located we dont necessarily have the hands on like we did at the city
9370516 as far as our union members the police officers and the public were taking a huge step back we have a tremendous amount of people that knock on the door between the hours of 4 30 and 6 7 00 in the morning all night long
9370517 youre going to dial 911 youre still going to get a police officer in the same amount of time and in fact in a more catastrophic event youre going to have multiple dispatchers rather than one

9370627 we have repeatedly urged her to sit and discuss the matter she had promised us that her agitation would be peaceful but she has deviated from her promise too
9370628 it is the states image that has suffered because of this agitation we have already told ms banerjee that we are ready to speak with the displaced people and see to it that their interests are upheld

9370631 ive sent the report to my headquarters at delhi im waiting for their orders
9370632 tatas nano project is a prestigious project for india and for the state of west bengal it would be unfortunate if issues other than economic and social come into play and force the tata management to consider pulling out from singur
9370633 the tatas pulling out of west bengal will be unfortunate for india immediate political dialogue to find a solution towards keeping the project in west bengal is imperative
9370634 if the house of tatas known for its values and care for society can face such resistance the much needed fresh wave of industrialisation in the country would suffer
9370635 nanos moving out would be a setback for not just west bengal but the entire country it is very unfortunate that the entire project is facing a political situation which it does not warrant the political parties involved must do their best to ensure that the concerns and issues of all the stakeholders are kept in mind including the companies in question and the original owners of the land
9370636 it is in the interest of both west bengal and india that the tata nano project is not moved at this stage withdrawal of the project will severely affect west bengals image and it certainly wont do indias image any good political parties must rise above partisan lines
9370637 investing en tity has a responsibility to take care of the interests of all stakeholders including people who are displaced or re employed
9370638 indeed given their level of social commitment i have no doubt that the tatas are fully aware of their responsibilities in singur as they have demonstrated in many of their companies
9370639 the first organisation of bengal with a distinct political object
9370640 consistent with pure loyalty to the person and government of the reigning sovereign of the british dominions

9370643 the separation of the legislature from the executive and the inclusion of some indian members in the legislature
9370644 suggested that public opinion in india should be taken into consideration before enactment of any legislation concerning india
9370645 in view of the large dependence on crude oil imports limiting the adverse impact of higher international oil prices would require adopting strategies of greater decontrol of petroleum product pricing with targeted subsidies rationalisation of applicable taxes and duties to appropriate levels and gradual but regular pass through of prices to consumers so as to avoid the risk of large one off adjustments in headline inflation
9370646 we started construction in a small way boundary wall is being erected structural fabrication is being done
9370647 globally most other tinplate firms suffered losses corus a tata steel entity closed its tinplate facility given the scenario tinplate has done well
9370648 the speculative juices are even more plentiful nearly 60 per cent of bullish positions if you count the bets placed by traditional commodity pools

9370652 the second phase of the scheme will begin soon with an additional rs 3 500 crore to modernise prisons since an expense of rs 5 300 crore on jails within the next five years shouldnt go without being audited it warrants professional help to judge whether the desired objectives are achieved or not
9370653 if the leadership does not agree we will unify the entire ulfa cadre in the field and go for peace talks
9370654 those working in the field realized that violence is not paying any more dividend and ulfa is losing public support
9370655 good response from not only the assamese people but also non assamese speaking people including bengalis biharis and marwaris living in the state
9370656 were sending this feedback to our leaders in bangladesh and are trying to put pressure on them to agree to unconditional talks
9370657 we have been talking about autonomous powers for assamese people but today illegal immigration from bangladesh has changed the states demographic pattern considerably so there is no point in fighting a revolution for bangladeshis
9370658 more such punishments if it continued violence against religious minorities in the country

9370697 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
9370698 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
9370699 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
9370700 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him

9370716 i think that was the key week getting me on the team
9370717 i certainly stalled in the middle of the campaign and it became hard work
9370718 i felt a lot of pressure today my drive at the last was my worst of the week
9370719 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9370720 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9370721 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9370722 i knew it was going in the hole right after i hit it it was a lot of fun today

9370732 i dont know if the market is more concerned about softening in demand than they are for a lack of production
9370733 now were getting closer to the event and so there may be a little bit more nervousness
9370734 will basically wait until we see what happens with the storm and how much damage is actually done

9370744 we will have to see what the scan shows when you lose steven gerard and then torres it is always a problem
9370745 we will have to see the extent of the injury if it is like gerrards it could be 10 to 15 days and he may only miss one game
9370746 i dont think the others realised shaquille had been stabbed at first they thought he had just been punched

9370755 the dressing room is down we pride ourselves on our results but there are some positives to take out today we are learning from our mistakes and we have some young players learning about international cricket
9370756 flintoff has been unbelievable he has proved he is a good player and he adds balance to the england side he is a world class performer
9370757 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot scolari said
9370758 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9370759 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9370760 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium
9370761 in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got
9370762 these last few days i saw that agostini was a little unhappy today though i saw him smile he came to greet me wished me well and i won
9370763 we have a 75 point lead which means that up to now weve been very strong weve never let up and more than everything weve kept our heads held high even during difficulties said rossi who has finished runner up in each of the past two seasons

9370778 when i am bigger i will pee in a cup too
9370779 of course this is a time when we have to do away with most of our party politics
9370780 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9370781 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9370782 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9370783 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9370784 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9370785 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9370786 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9370787 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9370788 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9370789 explorers dont leave fellow explorers lost we want to find out what happened to our friend and colleague no more and no less
9370790 while i feel hes under our nose here hes in an area thats extremely hard to get to its the vertical terrain its the dark terrain and its the trees the vegetation
9370791 if that aircraft didnt go straight down and kind of angled in under a stand of pine trees its going to take someone physically walking upon that scene to find it
9370792 its hard to believe in this day and age that someone could disappear like this until you go up in an aircraft and look at how rough the terrain is its absolutely amazing
9370793 if we dont find people are going to be coming out here for the next 50 years until he is found
9370794 a window unit air conditioner or the size of a shopping cart or a washing machine it could just be scattered debris
9370795 kids even when theyre sick are resilient theyre upbeat and hopeful and we wanted to give them that kind of environment
9370796 we will use it primarily for catastrophic storms as a way to safely evacuate in phases to get the galveston county population ahead of the regional population
9370797 at least we know weve got something and thats better than nothing when it comes to an orderly evacuation of the region
9370798 if some decide they cant live without air conditioning and theyre not in the danger zone and dont want to take a chance we have no control over that
9370799 people were more nervous than they had ever been for a hurricane when they saw the same storm on the same track over the course of five days anxiety levels were very high
9370800 its going to be very critical to set up the passes early to get good runs out of the corners and ultimately ensure that youre in the right gear and that youre looking well down the track so you can set up your passes
9370801 the first half of the track is very fast and then its tight in the last section
9370802 you have to be good in the high speed too because thats were you can make up some time and hopefully gap some of these guys this track likes to have some wing over the course of the testing our car responded better with more downforce
9370803 and this is the condescending bit that big brother has entrusted these microphones with a group of adults and does not expect them to be returned broken all the time
9370804 its their fault for giving you three glasses of wine
9370805 were not looking to call an evacuation and havent issued a state of emergency
9370806 its not going to come this way and were on the dry side anyway we may experience tropical force winds by tuesday
9370807 but as it moves into a less favorable environment in the north central gulf of mexico where the water temperatures are cooler it could encounter wind shear
9370808 we could get some rain bands out of it and theres the possibility of tropical force winds depending on where it is
9370809 we got everybodys telephone number and would call with instructions
9370810 we have 600 in texas city and about 1 100 or 1 200 on the mainland and several thousand in galveston
9370811 during rita we sent out everybody on school buses with no restrooms
9370812 it wasnt that comfortable and they traveled a long distance but it worked and would have saved lives
9370813 it only looked like that on lisa because she caked it on
9370814 enorme gravedad por la responsabilidad que implica para el gobierno y en particular para los ministros que impulsaron el transantiago y la forma c mo obtuvieron los pr stamos porque quiere decir que est n al margen de la ley

9370819 i was looking at the parking and getting a feel for what the needs are for the court water district and library
9370820 were over the contingency and i dont know where the funding will come from beyond that
9370821 maybe it will come out of savings down the road or from general revenue
9370822 the decisions to use the moneys to supplement the city hall project occurred despite the repeated forecast of a softening economy
9370823 were on schedule with the structural steel foundation and metal deck
9370824 the city is doing site improvements paving parking lots and drives
9370825 now that theyve emptied the garage im worried theyll move on to the house
9370826 we know theres people watching waiting for something to be left out
9370827 as long as there are a large number of people addicted to narcotics that live on this island well always have a problem with theft
9370828 you would expect that youd be able to put a potted plant on your porch but thats not the case
9370829 some people stealing is part of their culture and part of their life
9370830 to them its a 24 hour a day job if they want it bad enough theyre going to get it you have to remain vigilant against that
9370831 a phone is only as good as the network its on
9370832 so much for a new way of doing business at the old at amp t your fathers phone company
9370833 its hard to launch an iconic device like the iphone on a network that it is not yet fully deployed as they build these networks they will need to make more improvements or the complaints will persist both companies are accustomed to controlling all aspects of the delivery of its products it illustrates the culture clash when you create an environment where you share the responsibilities between them then you have problems
9370834 i get almost one a day its almost like hey quit spamming me
9370835 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9370836 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling however macs are a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products

9370838 as the various locations are declared eligible for individual relief were opening up disaster recovery centers
9370839 were dealing with a flooding situation that changes day to day its not like a hurricane that comes in does its damage and moves on the flood waters are still coming up in the southern and central part of the state right now
9370840 we are finding the biggest problem is once again that most people cant afford or arent in an area where they can get flood insurance
9370841 were working with the other agencies to try to put people together with the agencies that can help
9370842 weve always stressed that people need to bring their own bedding
9370843 in a situation like a hurricane theres not time to bring hundreds of thousands of cots into one location
9370844 how are we supposed to tell which of the fleeting feeling and random thoughts we have every day are worth paying attention to
9370845 jeg lover at vi fra mandag aften i dag red og gennem hele kongressen vil optr de som amerikanere og ikke som republikanere fordi amerika har brug for os nu
9370846 uagtet hvem vi er demokrater eller republikanere har amerika behov for at vi g r hvad amerikanere altid har gjort i tider med krise og udfordring

9370850 the staff will continue to monitor the hurricane as it makes its direct track
9370851 we may be experiencing winds on tuesday but we dont even have voluntary evacuations called on the west end for tides

9370853 they need to get home and not get caught in rain events
9370854 hopefully news coverage will be heavy and tell people when the roads are clear or when grocery stores are open
9370855 who knows the university of texas medical branch or mainland medical center might not be fully operational you have to gauge what there is to come back to like a worst case scenario but i certainly hope we dont see that
9370856 theres not much good in coming back in town if there is no electricity or no grocery stores to provide food after the storm makes landfall well determine how quickly to allow people back in
9370857 we are grateful for the efforts of the french eu presidency and will still respect all the agreements in the medvedev sarkozy plan in the form in which they were agreed
9370858 but it must be clear that broad cooperation on the economy and security policy can only be achieved with equal partners and it must take our interests into account
9370859 those who try in the media to open up new fronts will have to do it without us
9370860 it must be clear however that the continuation of anti russian provocations under which i include the current crisis will make cooperation on truly important issues to all of us more difficult
9370861 as long as we do not speak as equal partners nato and the eu run the risk of ending up in a situation we recognise from the cold war that the dog does not wag the tail but rather the tail in the form of vassal states wags the dog
9370862 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia

9371036 jagalah diri kalian dari api neraka walaupun hanya dengan segenggam kurma jagalah diri kalian walaupun hanya dengan seteguk air karena sesungguhnya allah swt akan menganugerahkan pahala kepada orang yang melakukan perbuatan mudah ini apabila ia tidak mampu melakukan yang lebih besar darinya wahai manusia barangsiapa di antara kalian yang memperbaiki akhlak kalian pada bulan ini niscaya allah akan mempermudah baginya ketika meniti jembatan yang pada hari itu kaki kaki akan mudah tergelincir ketika melewati di atasnya barangsiapa yang mencegah keburukan darinya pada bulan ini maka akan tercegah dari murka allah swt pada hari pertemuan dengan nya barangsiapa yang memuliakan anak yatim pada bulan ini maka allah swt akan memuliakannya pada hari menemui nya barangsiapa yang menyambungkan tali silaturahmi pada bulan ini maka allah swt akan menyambungkan dengan rahmat nya pada hari ia menemuni nya barangsiapa yang memutuskan tali silaturahmi pada bulan ini maka allah swt akan memutuskan rahmat nya darinya pada hari ia bertemu dengan nya barangsiapa yang mentaati allah swt pada bulan ini dengan mendirikan shalat maka allah swt akan menjauhkan ia dari api neraka barangsiapa yang melaksanakan kewajibannya pada bulan ini maka allah swt akan memberikan padanya pahala orang melaksanakan tujuh puluh kewajiban di bulan bulan lain barangsiapa yang banyak bershalawat kepadaku rasul maka allah swt akan memberatkan timbangan pahalanya di hari yang diringankannya timbangan timbangan pahala barangsiapa yang membaca maka akan diberikan padanya pahala orang yang menyelesaikan membaca seluruh pada bulan bulan lain wahai manusia sesungguhnya pintu pintu surga terbuka pada bulan ini maka mohonlah kepada allah agar tidak ditutup pintu pintu tersebut untuk kalian dan sesungguhnya pintu pintu neraka tertutup maka mohonlah kepada allah agar tidak dibuka untuk kalian pintu pintu tersebut dan sesungguhnya setan setan terbelenggu maka mohonlah kepada allah agar mereka tidak dapat menguasai kalian
9371037 i have been coaching for over 20 years longer than i played in fact or as long as i played i just have been around it for a long time i probably prepared myself in some way every year i have been in this game to become a head football coach by listening by being prepared at my own position and making sure when the opportunity presented itself that i could be as ready as anybody else
9371038 i dont have any butterflies yet but it is not 10 minutes before the game either
9371039 the only way i tried to sell anything to our football team is just trying to come in and be as organized as i could be and help our players have a great plan
9371040 when we got the news that coach zorn had been hired as offensive coordinator everybody was excited
9371041 then the news came that he was hired as the head coach
9371042 joe gibbs has been such a great force not just with the washington redskins but in the national football league he has made a huge statement and when i came in i just decided that if i tried every day to consider what that history has been then i would probably be kind of depressed and try to do something or pressure myself into something so i have kind of decided just to admire that to respect what he did and then to make sure i still just do my job and not try to fill shoes
9371043 there were a lot of people that were attached to coach gibbs
9371044 i think he zorn is a wonderful coach i think he is just as excited as we are when you have somebody with the opportunity the sky is the limit because all of the time he is thinking of something he comes out after practice sometimes happier than we are about a new play he put in and wants to see how it is going to be executed there is a lot more energy and positive vibes around to have him come in
9371045 the offense is wonderful it is what we have been trying to get put in the situation as exploiting our talent letting guys like santana moss have an opportunity to work one on one where he is not always double teamed or not in position i think coach z is going to find a mismatch and is going to find a way to get santana in and randall el and devin and malcolm kelly and james thrash the ball there is always going to be a favorable match up for us because he is going to find a way to work those guys where we can get the ball and i think having coach zorn come in he is going to put all of us in positions to make plays guys are excited about that
9371046 i did study it and i did see that in the run game in fact we are doing similar run game philosophies
9371047 i didnt study the passing game in depth because i already knew where i wanted to go with the passing game and so when you look at it you can see some similar pass patterns you see a few different kinds of protections and things like that but we kind of went in a different direction in the passing game
9371048 it is finding a way to get guys one on one before it was this is what we are going to do no matter what they do they have to stop us and you know fortunately for them more than not they had the opportunity to stop us we didnt have audibles before right now if we are in a bad play we can get out of that play jason has the opportunity to put up the audibles and change things around and get us points
9371049 i want the best for our players i want the best for our football coaches and i think probably the number one thing to pay attention to is are we communicating back and forth as one with the best information in the most efficient way so it gives our players the best opportunity to be out on the field and express their talents
9371050 i dont know any other way to say it but communicating is very very important and it is communicating through written word with playbooks and pictures and then verbally making sure we are saying the same thing as coaches in all phases
9371051 but i looooooove you please dont do this to me

9371128 we expect to see a quick and solid spike high within the next few weeks it may come as early as a few trading days from the date of this publication first we base this on the fact that the commitment of traders report in silver is showing us caution based upon countless previous experiences
9371129 march was one of the most volatile months for the precious metals ever experienced in modern history gold breached the 1 000 level and in a matter of days had fallen more than 100 silver moved above 21 per ounce and fell even harder hurting some folks who use leverage to trade these markets the fall is driven mainly because the price of precious metals is determined in a leveraged atmosphere as hedge funds panic and sell the commercial traders in the precious metals let out a huge sigh of relief as they are able to cover their short positions our sources indicate that many in the hedge fund community were urged to sell
9371130 last month we focused on the probability of the current corrective phase in the precious metals some are still of the opinion that the correction is almost over and we can expect to see silver and gold move toward their recent highs in short order
9371131 the market provided tons of information to comment upon this month but i want to keep it brief since much is available for free on the internet the cftc sent another message that they see no manipulation in the silver price i commented on this as did other silver commentators so if you missed it please check the main web site the thrust of my public article was that the amount of silver on paper is about 100 times the amount of physical silver and the silver derivatives are potentially a problem area in the future
9371132 i suspect a sharp and hard move to the downside similar to last year that will take all markets down including the mining shares and the metals

9371207 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9371208 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9371209 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9371210 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9371211 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring
9371212 leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten 99 9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use
9371213 the problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight
9371214 try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard
9371215 their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders
9371216 we dont study infertility but we put two and two together
9371217 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9371218 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9371219 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets

9371221 a written constitution containing suitable restrictions on the powers of government is sufficient of itself without the aid of any organism to counteract the tendency of the numerical majority to oppression and the abuse of power
9371222 the party in possession of the ballot box and the physical force of the country i e the military could be successfully resisted by an appeal to reason truth justice or the obligations imposed by the constitution
9371223 the end of the contest between net taxpayers and tax consumers would be the subversion of the constitution
9371224 the restrictions on state power would ultimately be annulled and the government be converted into one of unlimited powers
9371225 turned to the doctrine of interposition which defended the right of a state to interpose its authority to overrule federal legislation the seeds of this doctrine were introduced by thomas jefferson and james madison in the kentucky and virginia resolutions of 1798 and 1799

9371436 to me the ideal would be 70 because you get the biggest social security benefit possible and all those additional years of employment and it keeps you going mentally and physically too
9371437 i feel blessed with the good health that i have but im a little bit bitter because i dont think i should be scared financially at 68
9371438 that hurts me to see that some of these people are supporting their grandchildren

9371441 gambling that having a catholic on the ticket will draw in some of the fence sitting catholics
9371442 social issues such as abortion and gay marriage continue to be greatly overshadowed in the presidential campaign by both domestic issues and the war in iraq
9371443 but what we saw in the first week of bidens candidacy is that the catholic hierarchy is coming down hard
9371444 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong
9371445 the only way that biden is helpful in this election is that he brings the abortion issue back to the forefront
9371446 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
9371447 spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ
9371448 saltarellis replacement bishop francis malooly takes office on sept 8 and his approach to biden is unknown
9371449 would he start his own terms by courting such controversy most bishops and malooly is considered a deliberate fellow would want to get to know one of their flock before making any drastic public moves
9371450 if were told how to vote we turn off pretty quickly
9371451 joe biden has a rich story to tell and maybe that would put him out in front of the criticism
9371452 as catholics we should be thinking about how we treat each other when we talk about our faith
9371453 a nation for all how the catholic vision of the common good can save america from the politics of division

9371523 you know the experience that she comes from is what she has done in government and remember that alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia
9371524 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9371525 i am i am up to the task of course of focusing on the challenges that face america
9371526 and i am very pleased with the situation that i am in when when you consider the situation now that alaska will be in
9371527 and that is alaska and alaskans will be allowed to contribute more to our great country and theyll be allowed to do that because i if were elected will be in a position of opening the eyes of the country to what it is that alaska is all about and what alaska has to offer so i am happy to and very honored to be asked to do this i know its going to be great for alaska

9371531 itll be moist humidity rising he is so far from making it into the evil league of evil because he really isnt that bad at all
9371532 assisting evil people and inconveniencing people it doesnt take much

9371553 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9371554 tutta lestate lon enrico letta ha sostenuto pi volte limportanza di un dialogo aperto con ludc per una possibile alleanza in futuro sostenendo che tale opportunit sia lunica che permetta al suo partito di poter tornare a governare il paese
9371555 legittime aspirazioni ed analisi politica ineccepibile dal suo punto di vista tenendo anche conto della sua provenienza e della sua storia personale che chiaramente lo rende molto pi propenso a guardare al centro piuttosto che verso la sinistra radicale la quale per gli ha permesso per ben due volte di essere un autorevole esponente del governo prosegue comunque le sue lusinghe possono essere apprezzabili anche se relativamente interessanti abbastanza sconcertante invece quando lo si sente denigrare la classe dirigente delludc toscano alla festa del suo partito a modena
9371556 le sue affermazioni sono chiare e precise ha addirittura utilizzato un aggettivo che ci risparmiamo di ripetere che non lascia spazio a fraintendimenti
9371557 cotanto giudizio conclude certamente non toglier il sonno a noi militanti delludc toscano le nostre scelte le abbiamo gi fatte
9371558 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9371559 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9371560 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9371561 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9371562 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9371563 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9371564 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9371565 apprezzabili le sue lusinghe ma sconcertante le sue denigrazioni della classe dirigente delludc toscano
9371566 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9371567 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9371568 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9371569 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9371570 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9371571 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9371572 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9371574 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9371575 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9371576 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9371577 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9371578 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9371579 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9371580 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9371585 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9371586 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9371587 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9371588 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9371589 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9371599 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9371600 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9371606 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9371607 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9371608 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9371609 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti

9371622 if the existing barrier islands were a little higher and wider it could knock two to three feet off the storm surge
9371623 it would have been about a 200 million project it could have been finished by now

9371636 i never considered voting for mccain before today every day i see john kerry barbara boxer and others speak of her in their dissmisive tone my blood boils the fact is she knows how it is to have children and higher ambitions at the same time they dont appeal to my type of democrat never have and never will i suggest obama tell them to shut the hell up before they cost him the election
9371637 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9371638 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9371639 can she do it when democratic insults go too far
9371640 no one can cede jerusalem the city from which the prophet muhammad ascended to the heavens
9371641 a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
9371642 i am the lord and there is none else and there is no god beside me
9371643 i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour
9371644 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious ap pearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ
9371645 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name jesus christ under heaven given among men whereby we be saved
9371646 i jesus christ am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9371647 if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain
9371648 in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness
9371649 the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
9371650 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth
9371651 the future of the world is not secularism but religious pluralism
9371652 we cannot solve these problems without involving people of faith and their religious institutions it isnt going to happen any other way on this planet there are about 20 million jews there are about 600 million buddhists there are about 800 million hindus there are over 1 billion muslims and there are 2 3 billion christians if you take people of faith out of the equation you have ruled out five sixths of the world and if we only leave it up to secular people to solve these major problems it isnt going to happen
9371653 whos the man of peace in any village or it might be a woman of peace who has the most respect they dont have to be christian in fact they could be muslim but theyre open and theyre influential and you work with them to attack the five giants to which he has added global warming
9371654 i get it rick houses of worship are the distribution centers for all we need to do
9371655 there are some religious leaders in different religious faiths who in seeking to affirm their own faith and its authenticity and legitimacy deny other people their faith with its legitimacy and authenticity i dont think we can keep going like this without spawning the kind of hatred we are all here to try and solve i think its up to us to hold the clergys feet to the fire of whatever faith that we insist that we affirm what is beautiful in our own traditions while at the same time refusing to denigrate other faith traditions by suggesting that they are illegitimate or consigned to some kind of evil end
9371656 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name jesus christ under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him
9371657 yes but they are a massive volunteer force and distribution outlet of resources for slaying the giants of world suffering
9371658 by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
9371659 i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me
9371660 for our conversation citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the lord jesus christ
9371661 god didnt go to all the trouble of sending his son merely to point an accusing finger telling the world how bad it was he came to help to put the world right again
9371662 salvation is the entire universe being brought back into harmony with its maker this has huge implications for how people present the message of jesus yes jesus can come into our hearts but we can join a movement that is as wide and as big as the universe itself rocks and trees and birds and swamps and ecosystems gods desire is to restore all of it the goal isnt escaping this world but making this world the kind of place god can come to and god is remaking us into the kind of people who can do this kind of work
9371663 i think our future will also require us to join humbly and charitably with people of other faiths muslim hindu buddhist jewish secularists and others in pursuit of peace environmental stewardship and justice for all people things that matter greatly to the heart of god
9371664 this world the kind of place god can come to
9371665 when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth
9371666 that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full
9371667 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
9371668 you have faithful ministers to lead and guide you and therefore i trust you will be safe
9371669 called us into the fellowship of his son jesus christ
9371670 whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified
9371671 i have called thee from the ends of the earth and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away

9371837 egypt and the members of the arab league can contribute to this matter
9371838 the idea of an arab force in gaza is neither just nor balanced

9371930 you know the best way for a team to focus in my opinion is to start throwing a lot of smokescreens out there and everyone is thinking youre in disarray and all of a sudden everybody is focused and wanting to get back on task so much so that they shut everyone else up outside the locker room
9371931 when you do that kind of stuff it gets guys coming together so i dont buy it not one bit theyre going to come out ready to play no doubt about it
9371932 hes one of those coaches that gets a whole team up and ready to play
9371933 im with him all the way and every time i hit the quarterback its for him
9371934 my whole focus has been to win this football game
9371935 my life is defined by the 23 football games we get to play every year its not defined by the other things that are outside the borders of that
9371936 thats a huge thing for us it gives us great speed
9371937 well put him and no 5 arland bruce iii side by side and see if they can double cover both of them
9371938 casey is no 1 for a reason same with jesse
9371939 they both give us great ability but theyre also our offensive leaders
9371940 but you know what ive been playing this game and half our defence has been playing this game when he was popping zits and eating bologne sandwiches in college
9371941 theres nothing different same team we just have to come out with a win
9371942 im sure there will be some i hope there is
9371943 pain and cold are the only things that let you know youre alive so i dont mind that
9371944 its another game but labour day is always extra special and its a lot of fun to play in
9371945 i just have to deal with some stuff thats all it is and boils down to
9371946 it starts monday for us its time to put the past behind us and move forward
9371947 i picked ian because he is obviously a very determined guy and i love his attitude and obviously what he did at the british open
9371948 the back nine he played there was with the intention to win he had the emotional feeling and was not playing to finish second
9371949 maybe i should have gone to play gleneagles but i stuck by my word
9371950 looking back at the time i made the right decision for me but it was so difficult to choose the right thing to do and its obviously been a very difficult decision to try to get across
9371951 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9371952 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9371953 i fully respect the captains decision and i will be supporting the team from wherever i am
9371954 i thought it was between casey and poulter i thought clarke was a lock
9371955 but the guys he picked are really good his dilemma is a nice one to have you look at all the guys he had to choose i dont have that its not like i have a bunch of veterans with monster records at the ryder cup
9371956 tee to green paul has been playing absolutely the best through the summer and through the majors and i was kind of waiting for his putting to turn around

9372000 this is a fragile success this is a fragile victory
9372001 it can be reversed by doing what sen obama has advocated and thats setting a date for withdrawal
9372002 the mccain campaign should stop worrying about barack obamas travel plans and start focusing on addressing the pressing challenges that the bush mccain foreign policy has made worse
9372003 i think we ought to seriously look at whether we need to have it longer or not

9372024 thats one thing that im going to really look into this winter and were going to do some stuff in spring training
9372025 we havent been good enough last year we were 12 6 against the minnesota twins and 8 1 in the metrodome
9372026 its just one of those things if were going to do anything were going to have to do better against the white sox minnesota cleveland and kansas city
9372027 as a whole weve all made a big mistake i think
9372028 were not a perfect club so youre always looking to improve your club but to cop out and start blaming people i think thats a huge mistake we have a very solid nucleus in place here that has not performed well and im responsible for that
9372029 everybody understands what the situation is with the guys we have here
9372030 and you just try to put yourself in a position to succeed and get an opportunity if it doesnt come to you you deal with it and adjust
9372031 i cant speculate on what things are going to look like
9372032 thats why when people ask me about zach miner i dont know because i dont know whats going to happen there are a lot of games left this year and a lot of winter time before spring training
9372033 thats information that if it gets out i wouldnt want that information out but were going to have a plan
9372034 ive taken enough batting practice where i feel confident enough to go up against live pitching and ive taken enough fly balls in kansas city where that shouldnt be a problem
9372035 running the bases might be a problem because im not 100 percent but i can play through some discomfort but i want to hear what the doctor says
9372036 even if i can play the last week or the last two weeks ill do it i dont want to sit on the bench
9372037 i think its time to push it and see what i can do
9372038 but if in a week or so if im still making progress and the doctor doesnt think i need surgery then maybe well wait another week or so
9372039 olson will start tomorrow ive gotten medical clearance to activate jones
9372040 the rest of the callups ill talk to president of baseball operations andy macphail about after the game tonight and well take care of that tomorrow
9372041 what i hoped he learned from it is youve got to command your fastball
9372042 youve got to throw it over the plate youve got to pitch ahead hell get an opportunity tomorrow to pitch at fenway park and well see what weve got
9372043 i would think that every opportunity he gets is a big one
9372044 im not looking for him to be perfect were just looking for improvement were looking for him to be somewhat more consistent get us deeper in the game command the fastball
9372045 it all goes back to square one with us weve been saying it about every guy
9372046 if you cannot command the fastball you cannot have any type of success at this level if you cant hit the fastball youre probably not going to have much success as a position player ill put it right to the point i think guys make it a whole lot more difficult than it is
9372047 youve got a chance if you throw it over the plate you have no chance at all if you keep walking people and pitching behind its only a matter of time before youre going to get yourself in a situation where youre going to get your team behind youre going to get yourself in trouble and youre going to get taken out of the game
9372048 he not only has a chance to be an all around player he has a chance to be a complete player
9372049 considering what hes had to deal with hes come a long way
9372050 he has shown ability to square up the ball and has put together good at bats
9372051 this stretch of baseball that weve played weve kind of had to force everybody out there every day it will be good to have some bodies up here
9372052 you normally dont like too much of an overflow because with the extra group batting practice gets a little longer
9372053 but we need some help right now we need some more players to give us some more maneuverability for sure
9372054 paul molitor told me midseason that he saw mijares in a ball and said hell be in the big leagues before the year was out
9372055 that must have gone a long ways because hes coming to the big leagues theyve said hes just been throwing the living fire out of the ball
9372056 we werent using him at the end when he was here very seldom at best
9372057 hes worked very hard through this organization hell do a great job
9372058 ive won some day games lately but i dont know how i was a little sluggish out there today but when we got up 6 2 i could see the finish line and my adrenaline started pumping it was a good all around game
9372059 he was a pitcher hitter baserunner hes throwing strikes with his fastball to set up his breaking ball earlier in the year they were sitting on his breaking ball
9372060 dusty gives me opportunities i dont think he gives to other pitchers they think im rickey henderson now
9372061 when youre cold that ball is caught the wind knocked that ball down freddy lewis thought that ball was hit deeper by the sound i thought it was off the wall at first
9372062 as you pitch longer in the league they make adjustments to you i switched the grip on my sinker i can throw my breaking stuff on the outer half now to righties which has helped i can get more ground balls when i need them
9372063 ask me again when the seasons over i may break into tears
9372064 for me it just means ill have to clean out the locker next to me
9372065 we sit around and talk about it but we dont want to jinx it
9372066 but one of us will stop the other if it goes too far
9372067 this gustav the storm heading towards the gulf coast is proof that there is a god in heaven
9372068 tasteless to spit in the face of religious people by attempting to desecrate one of their religious objects
9372069 however if they are praying they most definitely should be laughed at
9372070 take heed to yourselves if your brother sins against you rebuke him and if he

9372078 east asia pollution aerosols could impose far reaching environmental impacts at continental hemispheric and global scales because of long range transport
9372079 this is very challenging science with lots of complexities and a lot of uncertainties
9372080 this pollution is distributed on average equally from northern california to british columbia
9372081 anyone who has gone out to measure it has found something
9372082 why would people choose to believe in a god even if he didnt

9372119 no one who has ever looked a gorilla in the eyes can come away unmoved
9372120 we also need to guard against militia men the other kind of guerrillas even though the war is over they still come
9372121 six of my colleagues were killed here in virunga in 1997
9372122 missy you cannot see my gorillas looking like this you will frighten the children they will flee when they spy a wide eyed muddy wild haired female form rising up out of the undergrowth with wads of tissue paper coming out of her nose and ears
9372123 but this is not enough we need more than what money can buy to be effective our game rangers need motivation equipment training and discipline at this time our government has commitments elsewhere and soon the conservation effort will collapse we find ourselves up against well equipped and well trained bandits and unless we solve these issues now mankind will wipe the gorillas out in less than a hundred years after they were first discovered
9372124 rebels dont consider park rangers as neutral they think that as we work for the government we must support everything the government stands for therefore bang youre dead
9372125 in the past ten years 65 of my rangers have been killed by militia men
9372126 we do things the african way each man that was lost in the line of duty is remembered every day because we give a fallen comrades name to a mountain gorilla that way they live on in memory and their spirits live on to care for our animals
9372127 large settlements have established themselves within this park which is largely responsible for the de forestation happening all around us
9372128 they cut down trees for fuel and create grazing land for their large herbs of cattle
9372129 until recently we protected the breeding sites of the fish on lake edward the fishermen were over harvesting the lake using illegal nets then the military validated the fishermans actions leaving us without power to protect our heritage
9372130 conservation under political crisis is very difficult one politicians election campaign actively encouraged the parks destruction this was purely to gain the voters confidence the laws pertaining to wildlife paled into insignificance during the war now that the war is over they are still mostly ignored
9372131 our success during one of the bloodiest civil wars in history is fully attributable to them men that serve and protect virunga my men are fearless and passionate about their work they accept there are risks involved but have little time to dwell on its dangers as we have more than 3 000 square miles of virunga to tend to
9372132 heaven is his throne and earth is but his footstool
9372133 no i mean this is a good story i write for the newspaper
9372134 i expect every member of the cabinet to work together on the best possible package for families of nsw and this includes the treasurer
9372135 the treasurer will abide by those directions statements about quitting wont cut any ice while we put together the best possible budget response
9372136 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9372137 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9372138 it really denies the uniqueness of who the indigenous people are and what their contribution to this country can be in their own right as if they have nothing to contribute except the absorption of the culture that the west has offered to us its a pretty damnable statement if thats the case
9372139 were not living normal lives were totally over represented in the social indicators were dying a lot younger we dont have the education opportunities people are living below the poverty line in many parts of australia it is not just those in northern australia who are battling to make ends meet
9372140 it really promotes the urban remote divide and that is really quite wrong
9372141 im just disappointed that he should go out on a note like that when we know theres been a lot of emphasis on remote areas and the difficulties there but there are huge huge difficulties in urban australia and we need to bridge that gap
9372142 we await to see the formal offer for an eba
9372143 my boy wanted to achieve something with his life and this is what he achieved
9372144 i gave him the chance to go i wish i hadnt one day hed asked me for an ipod and i said no i wish i had said no to this too he was a nice affectionate boy i had a lovely time with him
9372145 he told me daddy ive done really well this is going to be my third or fourth solo flight and its not so difficult he was so confident how could he have made such a mistake i think the school perhaps didnt give him the right instructions
9372146 only when we know exactly what happened will we decide what to do we want a proper investigation
9372147 its taken 42 years to get these citations and now we have to pay for them the next of kin of dead veterans have to pay for it as well

9372151 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
9372152 for evil to conquer good men need only do nothing
9372153 this is a pennant race i want men on the field
9372154 it means a lot to me to come back up here and be where i was at the beginning of the year
9372155 i know that i can do it and thats what theyre counting on im just going to do my part and help these guys out so we can get to the playoffs
9372156 i got a lot a lot of confidence in him but its up to him
9372157 hes got more experience than broadway and were going to need a lefty more than a righty because we got octavio dotel and a couple guys we can use in that role three lefties in the pen is going to help me a little more
9372158 hes going to speak his mind and i needed to hear all that and it was said to me as well
9372159 thats fine ozzies going to be ozzie its fine to hear that it was a wakeup call to me and just adds fuel to the fire and i take it as a positive and go out there with that when i go to the mound
9372160 i think with vlad he feels better after having a couple days off last week and this gives him today and tomorrow off again
9372161 we want to keep him at that level that hes been the last couple of months
9372162 with torii we talked internally about getting him off his feet for a day
9372163 he ran into the wall pretty hard the last two nights
9372164 im a little sore youve got today and tomorrow off to let it heal a little bit its nothing dangerous
9372165 its actually good for your health normally i dont do that but i need it i never say that
9372166 i think the main reason was to get me in there to get some more at bats
9372167 but i told them that i was all for it anything i can do to improve my versatility i think that its only going to help me in the long run
9372168 take edgar he can play outfield infield and he even caught in spring training the guy can do it all
9372169 to go out in the outfield and play some its only going to increase my versatility
9372170 im excited to learn a new position im going to try and have fun with it

9372211 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free

9372215 i have asked all u n agencies working in afghanistan to step up support to the local authorities as they work to help the survivors
9372216 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9372217 i will ask stephen harper face to face to explain why he is in such a rush to violate the spirit of his own legislation

9372219 the prime minister should be spending less time trying to dream up contrived reasons for forcing an election and more time addressing the serious issues facing our country not the least of which is an ongoing food safety crisis
9372220 in uncertain economic times it is important for a governing party to have a mandate from the people
9372221 we still expect it is going to be another minority government but the question is is it going to be a liberal or a conservative minority government
9372222 close your mouth please martin we are not a codfish
9372223 we want an agreement to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital
9372224 president abbas told olmert that we will not be part of an interim or shelf agreement

9372234 we are making plans on a day by day basis
9372235 to make sure that nothing we do detracts from the activities in the gulf
9372236 we can activate an email list of a couple million people who want to give back
9372237 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9372238 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9372239 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9372240 were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible

9372250 some of your best coaching is done off the track
9372251 obviously they have great passion for the program and know what they are doing
9372252 but hes had the best team in iowa for 10 years better than iowa and iowa state and deserved the chance to move up
9372253 you mean looking out at john mcdonnell field and writing on john mcdonnell stationery at john mcdonnell way
9372254 its not about me being comfortable but about my athletes being comfortable
9372255 what arkansas has done at penn is so much a part of the success here
9372256 when youre a road hog you start tailgating by wednesday and sometimes by tuesday
9372257 we practice tailgating that we get it right come saturday

9372260 he sat down in one of our chairs and kept talking to himself about how we just lost to a basketball school
9372261 we had no idea until we saw each other at the wedding
9372262 ive gone to a couple of scrimmages and ua quarterback casey dick looks phenomenal
9372263 we wanted to offer consumers a flat tv with a design so minimal that when the set was switched off it would appear as though it is a painting on the wall
9372264 with a depth of just 38mm the essence is lightweight slim line and is easy to hang on a single hook it also is packed with technology to deliver best in class viewing performance
9372265 the new scarlet lg7000 is truly sophisticated in terms of technology and design to provide viewers with richer entertainment experiences

9372267 at just 8mm thick our ultra thin display concept will enable the thinnest 32
9372268 our concept is also very light around 5 kg enabling a 32
9372269 weve managed to cut the size of the light guide which is the thickest part of an lcd from around 25mm to just 1mm
9372270 hence the thickest part of the display has now become one of the thinnest parts even thinner than the lc panel this has been key in achieving the sleek ultra thin design
9372271 the mccain pick has probably stunted any obama democratic convention bump
9372272 was almost immediately hailed as a strong conservative by voters who rallied to the gop ticket our survey shows
9372273 were going to spend every day looking for every opportunity to remind voters in the twin cities and across the country that a vote for john mccain is a vote for george bush and his failed policies
9372274 the likeliest scenario is that gustav strikes on monday and we hold all our business sessions but nothing else on monday
9372275 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9372276 well change our program and ill be announcing details of it in the next few hours but theres very little doubt that we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9372277 they dont have to be in the convention hall to accept the nominations
9372278 spare in der zeit dann hast du in der not
9372279 die nacht ist am dunkelsten zur d mmerung und dann kommt das licht
9372280 he would have been stranded when the monster storm arrived life 1 saved
9372281 relative to montreal new york is lacking in decent venues
9372282 its montreal that has a better set up for the structured ecstasy of live indoor acts
9372283 visitors to the site submit favorite urls for particular messages published and vote to nominate that which they believe to be the best
9372284 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
9372285 you need to be scared and you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts out of new orleans right now
9372286 we hope the storm will diminish a little but we have to be prepared for the worst
9372287 count on no parish or state services none will be provided
9372288 many folks counted him down and out a year ago the other candidates stopped paying attention to him they did not make a play to gather his support for themselves quietly under the radar he rebuilt himself the others were caught sleeping one has to give john mccain credit for doing that
9372289 since he locked up the nomination mccain has made personal advances with conservatives most importantly one of the fears they had about him was that he was on a crusade to not just get the nomination but to remake the republican party in a way which would leave conservatives outside looking in
9372290 mccain once likened it to a hostile takeover as i recall but it appears the mccain camp has decided essentially to let the gop remake itself which is comforting it is a signal that mccain is ready to be president not just retool the party
9372291 we want 100 percent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own get out of town this is not the one to play with
9372292 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9372293 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9372294 i think he is by most standards a conservative its important quite frankly for those of us who are conservatives to not so narrowly define conservatism as to have the effect of constantly shrinking ourselves
9372295 on some areas such as spending and reform on things like earmarks his conservatism is a darned sight better than a lot of other senators whose conservatives credentials we never question
9372296 on occasion senator mccain stakes out a position that irritates the right but he has shown a propensity to change his mind when confronted with additional information like offshore drilling i would urge fellow conservatives to be reaganesque and accentuate the positive
9372297 id say mccain fits fairly comfortably in the shoes of ronald reagan
9372298 he ran this time as a reagan republican a tax cutter he criticized george bushs spending issues hes good on school choice tax reform issues free trade and alternative approaches to legal immigration
9372299 ask conservatives how they feel about mccain compared to the idealized perfect conservative that is not the question now its how do they feel when they compare mccain to obama the vast majority are committed to mccain unless something completely bizarre happens
9372300 in disagreement especially in disagreement i will seek the counsel of my fellow conservatives if i am convinced my judgment is in error i will correct it and if i stand by my position even after benefit of your counsel i hope you will not lose sight of the far more numerous occasions when we are in accord
9372301 i count myself as a conservative republican yet i view it to a large degree in the theodore roosevelt mold

9372309 to postpone a convention is much more difficult than you might think
9372310 i do believe there are other methods to deal with that potential situation so that we recognize and show the gravity of the situation and still do our business
9372311 we continue to track the path of the storm and there is no scheduling change to speak of yet
9372312 but at the white house we are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to minnesota
9372313 i dont want to wade into the white house decision making at this point the main priority has to be making sure that everything is being done on the ground to avoid a repeat
9372314 sometimes we can be a distraction in these kinds of situations

9372325 he was the first coach that talked to me about education about getting a degree
9372326 he saidbruce a million dollars and a 10 year contract is not enough to get me to leave the university of arkansas
9372327 i want to thank coach broyles because it was from my time here i learned the intensity that took me through 41 years of coaching
9372328 he could make you believe you were better than you were

9372333 i am speaking of the former players i am speaking of the coaches i am speaking of the press and i am speaking of the fans
9372334 i thought the first 20 minutes of the game were absolutely stunning with the one touch passing from us creating some great looks at goal and i think things were looking good to begin
9372335 give our opponents credit for fighting back with passion and energy
9372336 we had a shot off the post and one off someones shin
9372337 the goal they scored was a deflected shot so thats soccer
9372338 but holmes the girls want some no you cant why not elementary school my dear watson

9372340 the unforced errors are definitely something we need to address
9372341 weve been doing a pretty good job of that in practice but we need to carry that over to matches we are giving opponents far too many points
9372342 the high point for us today is the way we played in much of set one
9372343 in practice on the back of our shorts was defense dedication and discipline
9372344 i had two of those down but the discipline part came later
9372345 were having intrasquad and coach debriyn is out in center field on his famous megaphone its bases loaded and the game on the line and i moved out of the way of a pitch
9372346 coach debriyn started in from center field to let me know this is college baseball not high school
9372347 i very quickly taught myself to stand in the box
9372348 in fact one of the records that i did set was the career record for hit by pitches
9372349 i am proud to have played for a pillar of the community
9372350 i just hope in my induction people can add something else to the legacy of john mcdonnell

9372357 in the 1930s all i did as a kid was listen to the radio for two hours when i got home from school radio was everywhere filled with what created the consumer society
9372358 the characters are not merely products of the american dream theyre the dreamers who keep it going as well theyre myth buyers consumers who devour the dream as if their identities and then their very lives depend upon the intake
9372359 radio functions here as myth barker hawking its american dream of love songs and glamour and norge home appliances to people who cant afford the price

9372405 the tired assertion of a separation of church and state has no historical or constitutional basis neither the language of the constitution itself nor the legislative history reveals any mention of such separation

9372505 we did the attack on the marines in kuwait we did the attack on the synagogue in tunisia we did the attack on those awful corrupt nightclubs in bali and its all a wonderful thing and its all in the name of islam
9372506 we need to understand that almost all people of the muslim faith except for the extremists are valuable members of our society and societies around the world
9372507 its important for people to understand that perspective so that together we can defeat extremism i think thats whats very important about this relationship
9372508 id like to foster the relationship i think its important for the nation
9372509 may the holy days of ramadan remind us all to seek a culture of compassion and serve others in charity

9372512 america muslims are a part of america and we have documentation that they have fought for this country since the revolutionary war
9372513 im an american my wife is an american my daughter is an american and my sister and my nieces and nephews
9372514 if i am not willing to defend them then who will be
9372515 ive known the soldiers i work with for a long time and they dont treat me any different just because im from a different culture
9372516 theyre pretty considerate of my religion for example when some of the soldiers go to get food for everybody they always make sure there is a plate without pork
9372517 when you get cultural awareness training they only give you so much information and many of the soldiers to include myself still had questions
9372518 instead of asking their question in front of everybody they felt more comfortable asking elboctorcy and he would explain his point of view hes a very tolerant person and willing to answer those questions
9372519 some people think that everyone who is a muslim is a radical but thats not the case
9372520 there are a few just like in every religion who are extremist but i was definitely not brought up that way
9372521 i joined the army because i wanted to make a difference in the war using my language but at that time there was no military occupational specialty for arabic linguist
9372522 i guess in a sense i am making a difference because even though im not out there talking to iraqis im still providing information to the soldiers who want to know more about arabic cultures
9372523 he doesnt explain how the cultures are different he explains how the cultures are similar
9372524 i feel a strong connection to iraqis who have dual citizenship with a country like the u s or great britain
9372525 we can share experiences weve had in living in both cultures and speaking both languages
9372526 ive never been stereotyped or judged by the soldiers i work with they know me and they know im from new york
9372527 dont get me wrong i still love pakistan but america has my heart and i will always be an american
9372528 he said we believe in all the prophets angels and only one god
9372529 every day after i came home from work like it was a best selling novel
9372530 three weeks later i called him back and told him i wanted to be muslim
9372531 i dont cheat i dont drink liquor i dont steal i dont lie
9372532 islam is a peaceful religion there are muslims whose actions arent islamic
9372533 the government that were helping setting up is a muslim council
9372534 as far as i was concerned i was there helping my brothers and sisters
9372535 i saw a lot of things that didnt strike me too well growing up in the church
9372536 i compared christianity and islam i talked to the muslims and i talked to the christians and thought you know this is what i need to be doing
9372537 but surprisingly it hasnt been that hard its worth it in the end on a religious level it makes me feel closer to god and on a personal level its about strength
9372538 when i met ali shahs family they were very welcoming
9372539 islam is a religion where if you have a big group of people its enjoyable to practice together
9372540 but even if its just you or you and your wife you can practice in your home together
9372541 they ask how do you feel about going to iraq and fighting your muslim brothers and sisters and i say well america is my country
9372542 from containment to global leadership america and the world after the cold war

9372550 it was an attempt to destroy the ossetian people to push them out of the territory of south ossetia that as mr saakashvili the president of georgia and probably some of his western sponsors believed would solve the problem with the separatist region and according to the documentary proof were now seeing they planned after that to conduct the same operation in abkhazia thats what has happened genocide is what has happened widespread physical destruction with artillery shells tanks and guns of thousands of russian citizens basically an ethnic cleansing operation was carried out
9372551 well in the past two weeks an unbelievable chain of events evolved in my country i would never believe that in the 21st century in a modern civilized community in europe my country would be militarily invaded by the neighbour country the russian federation thats what happened what weve seen it was already not ad hoc skirmishes from the separatist regimes only but it was well planned large scale military operation with which weve been placed in a position either to respond or right away to surrender to the russian military because on the night when the large scale confrontation happened the georgian villages were extensively shelled and through the roki tunnel from the north already tanks and armoured vehicles were coming in a large scale so the attack was very harsh casualties were rising at the time so the decision was taken to respond to that basically
9372552 lets be rational if the russian federation had known in advance as you say that saakashvili had such insane plans then of course we would have acted accordingly and would at least have put our military forces directly along the border between russia and south ossetia and by the rockskiy tunnel between north and south ossetia in that case we could have responded within a couple of hours but naturally that didnt happen because we couldnt know about saakashvilis plans of course we needed some time about a day to send our troops to south ossetia to protect our citizens and peacekeepers and in that time georgian troops shelled a city without being challenged they fired on it with tanks and artillery they crushed children under tank tracks they burned women who were locked in sheds all in all they conducted genocide and ethnic cleansing
9372553 yes it was from the roki tunnel it is the north part of the south ossetia region it is the main connecting route from russia to south ossetia it was this tunnel with which all the military equipement had been coming it was already on the 7th of august that the large scale movement started meaning tanks and armed vehicles coming into the territory of south ossetia every other state which has intelligence information from aerial pictures its credibly seen that within a day there were already 6 000 russian soldiers on the territory of south ossetia
9372554 defending itself from what from the ossetian people at the moment when georgia unleashed its military action in the conflict zone there were about three hundred and fifty russian peacekeepers armed only with machine guns since no other weapons were allowed according to the ceasefire agreement then in place between russia and georgia for south ossetia there were no grads multiple rocket launchers and no tanks there it was peacekeepers and local civilians and a very small force dwarfed by the georgian army the military forces of south ossetia the number of soldiers was completely mismatched so who was it georgia was defending itself against it wasnt defending it was attacking and only after we sent our additional troops to reinforce the peacekeeping contingent and to start a peace enforcing operation only then did saakashvili cry out hysterically that russia was attacking him
9372555 well first of all the response was to the threat to the georgian villages and then the threat was coming from the shelling of tskhinvali and it was the military response to that and other than that the tactical moves around the roki tunnel i know that we were able to damage the bridge from which the equipement what we already knew of had come out of the roki tunnel but then they managed to bypass the bridge and then still enter with heavy equipment
9372556 well the targets that were identified for the military forces on the georgian side were legitimate targets which was the artillery weapons from the other side it was very unfortunate that the artillery from the other side had been placed in some cases in the residential areas because its the responsibility of the party which uses any weapons to install these weapon or an object a military object which in itself is a legitimate target for an attack outside of any locations with which civilians can be impacted it would have been the same obligation for the georgian forces not to place its own weapons right in the middle of the residential areas so that when the opposing party would respond to the artillery or any other firing from the georgian side they would inevitably hit the civilian targets as well
9372557 eye witnesses i think its more something that president saakashvilis has said i wouldnt trust such eyewitnesses too much as many of them resemble too much goebbels propaganda trying to present white as black and vice versa trying to present a victim of an aggression as the initiator of the aggression and vice versa our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone instead they launched strikes in response to the georgian forces attacks such as artillery which were still targeting tskhinvali there was speculation panicky rumours and disinformation that russian tanks had allegedly entered gori stories of russian planes bombing tbilisi they were all goebbels style lies invented by the georgian leadership
9372558 absolutely incorrect i was in gori during the confrontation myself several times nothing was ever placed in the center of gori what weve seen from the russian side was not collateral damage to the civilians that they inflicted but direct targeting of civilians
9372559 for several days the russian federation was conducting a military operation of peace enforcement that operation is now concluded successfully by that i mean that georgia is now no longer capable of repeating its military offensive in south ossetia or abkhasia and only now when the operation has been completed and its goals achieved can russian criminal investigators and other law enforcement officials work in the field to collect evidence which will then be presented to the international community along with corresponding accusations against the georgian leadership
9372560 if theres any need for enforcement of peace in any part of the globe its a specific task of the security council and the chapter 7 to decide upon those measures and implement those measures
9372561 i hope it will hold i hope this time the georgian leadership will have enough sense not to repeat the adventures it has pursued lately i hope very much that the ceasefire will hold firm but ill repeat to ensure the ceasefire lasts we will take all necessary action for the security of our russian citizens living in south ossetia and abkhazia
9372562 not the russian army but peacekeeping forces deployed there legitimately you have to agree theres a big difference and the difference is fundamental
9372563 well georgia can call them whatever it wants it wont change the reality
9372564 well plans from the russian side are quite clear they wanted to initially destabilise georgia to provoke confrontation in georgia and with that to make sure that georgia can never be an independent state from russia
9372565 definitely yes if we can establish a genuinely international format for negotiations and security on the ground im more than confident that well be able step by step to establish a process in which the re integration of these regions will be full scale for the benefit of all who used to live in those regions who now live in those regions and they will be prosperous parts of a prosperous georgia if that is the case then

9372640 im delighted this much needed scheme is moving forward over the past few years considerable emphasis has been placed on the need to improve mental health services for young people this unit will be a big step in helping to improve the services we can offer and in an environment designed for young people
9372641 this is excellent news we look forward to working with all colleagues in commissioning the new purpose built unit to improve services to young people across the whole of south wales

9372663 i couldnt pick her out of a lineup of people
9372664 i have never met this woman but apparently the anti fluoride group seems to have a large pocket in our district and apparently i didnt realize how large it was
9372665 that battle was fought before i got on the board and i wasnt part of that debate
9372666 i am certainly not interested in revisiting that issue i have grandchildren and i want them to have healthy teeth
9372667 i think a lot of people are becoming more and more aware of the fluoride issue just as i have become more recently
9372668 i know mr fink kind of brushed that issue off as not being an important issue maybe he might rethink that
9372669 we looked at candidates and noticed there werent a lot of them who were against fluoridation in the water
9372670 shes avidly against fluoride we were behind her the whole way
9372671 with this campaign well be spending more time with people and talking to them in different ways to combat the fearmongering that goes on
9372672 not only to gain publicity by inviting people to identify the fluoridated water but also counter claims that water from one of the citys supply sources lynmore is ideally pure and good tasting and should not be tampered with by fluoridation
9372673 free to directly attack anti fluoridation misinformation as untrue and harmful
9372674 oral health is an important health issue and previous campaigns havent really given people the chance to hear all sides of the story
9372675 councillors appear reluctant to make the decision to fluoridate on their own but if a referendum is held via the council then we want to make sure people will be making an informed choice

9372698 we had arranged for the cyclo drivers to pick us up again at 8 30 for todays ride they took us to an old vietnamese pagoda there was a park there and thanh had fun walking around it was pretty far from the hotel so we were gone for three hours thanh fell asleep in the cyclo on the way back to the hotel horns honking mopeds zooming by and our girl was fast asleep

9372709 the tribunal runs a district inquiry programme so claims are heard by the district they relate to and most of those inquiries have been done theres a few districts to go and a few districts under way at the end of those the tribunal will reassess where its at with the claims and perhaps do generic claims of the mop up where they look at all the claims that havent been heard and inquired into so theres no deadline on that
9372710 first of all its an improvement on where georgie was ranked at the last list and i think really on our current polling shes in the top 20 and thats not to be sniffed at and i think it reflects the regard shes held by the party so im very proud shes in our top 20

9372754 het ironische is natuurlijk dat ik speciaal voor jan smit de reis van tilburg naar breda had gemaakt
9372755 het was heel vreemd jan werd aangekondigd een gejuich steeg op daar kwam hij het podium oplopen en precies op dat moment was het alsof alles wat ik in mij had zich in mijn maag verzamelde ik zei tegen mn vrouw ik geloof dat ik niet goed wordt ik moest ineens ontzettend nodig poepen ik keek om me heen en als in een soort slow motion zag ik overal mensen naar hun buik grijpen
9372756 ik vind het ondraaglijk te moeten accepteren dat jan smit mij fysiek onpasselijk heeft gemaakt ik volg hem nu een tijdje intensief niet dat ik naar zijn concerten ga hoor het is meer vanaf de bank ik kijk naar zijn tv optredens ik lees de interviews ik lees de interviews met yolanthe zijn verloofde ik koop soms een jan smit trui bij de c amp a al mn onderbroeken zijn jan smit onderbroeken mijn vrouw heb ik een lingeriesetje van yolanthes choice cadeau gedaan zelfs op een vrouw van 120 kilo blijft dat een prachtig product ik zie hoe jan op een camping in spanje vrienden als xander de buisonj uitnodigt om samen gezellig muziek te maken en een beetje over het leven te praten ik lees over de prachtige relatie die jan en yolanthe hebben over hun huisje in volendam over de kleine dagelijkse dingen die in al hun eenvoud het leven zo mooi maken ik ken jan en yolante beter dan de meeste van mijn vrienden het zijn mijn vrienden
9372757 hallo breda was het enige wat ik die avond uit de mond van jan heb horen komen daarna werd alles zwart intzwart
9372758 totdat de preciese oorzaak is vastgesteld lijkt het me onverstandig enig risico te nemen mocht ikzelf directeur van de tros zijn dan had ik per direct alle programmering rondom jan smit voor onbepaalde tijd opgeschort de rest van de media raad ik ook aan om niet meer in te gaan op jan smits pogingen in het nieuws te komen
9372759 we zitten nu op de bank gezellig met een kopje thee naar sbs shownieuws te kijken en we zijn heel erg geschrokken gelukkig heb ik zon lieve man als jan

9372782 dan heb je het over een omvangrijk tekort op een totaal van 3000 psychiaters mis je er 300 en dan moet je als sector alle zeilen bijzetten om te zorgen dat er geen ongelukken gebeuren
9372783 voor ouders met kinderen met autisme of adhd bijvoorbeeld is het grootste probleem om berhaupt een diagnose te krijgen van een psychiater
9372784 dat vind ik een enorm hoog aantal het betekent dat er een groot tekort is aan artsen in de ggz die basisartsen worden vaak gebruikt om de gaten in vacatures voor psychiaters op te vullen dat is een heel ongewenste situatie dat is echt een misstand
9372785 pati nten zien soms pas na twee jaar een psychiater maar er is maar n manier om een pati nt te beoordelen namelijk de pati nt zelf zien en niet verslagen van anderen lezen psychiaters zijn een pati ntenfobie aan het ontwikkelen

9372920 islamic jihad lives off of iran it is more similar to hizbullah than to hamas in this respect hamas cooperates with iran but islamic jihad is dependent on it if islamic jihad attempts to undermine the cease fire hamas will explain to them in terms they understand that it will have to pay for such a move
9372921 hamas has enough power to keep the small islamic jihad down iran could try and implement this plan but hamas would put an end to it as the cease fire is in hamass interest hamas is buying weapons getting organized and attempting to extend its sphere of influence to become more than a terror organization

9372939 particle physics which is my business has been quiet for a long time
9372940 because we were too successful in the 1970s when a thing called the standard model was invented
9372941 we have never found any deviation from these models so weve been right for 30 years its sort of boring
9372942 and we learn by doing experiments and seeing how nature behaves
9372943 thats why the swiss milk continues to be so good the cows dont care
9372944 but the vacuum surprisingly is not empty there is a difference between vacuum and nothingness take a room and take everything out and take the light out and people out and air out when you think it is truly truly empty it isnt empty it can still contain a substance which is the vacuum which is not entirely empty in some sense
9372945 we think that the masses of particles are a sort of friction with the vacuum
9372946 they do not travel freely with the vacuum but rather interact with it in some way
9372947 those black holes will not be dangerous ones of science fiction that eat up everything
9372948 that would tell us we really havent understood anything about the vacuum
9372949 although that is the most interesting possibility suppose we dont find it and dont find anything else how do we explain that not finding anything is the best possible thing it would be very difficult

9372955 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9372956 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9372957 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9372958 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9372959 well get a taste in the next five days of how well she does in the 62 days that follow
9372960 seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9372961 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9372962 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9372963 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9372964 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9372965 i cant claim a bill clinton and say i never inhaled
9372966 it has really opened my eyes to international events and how war impacts everyday americans like us
9372967 we had a bad fishing year so we didnt have any money
9372968 my husband loves being a dad as much as i love being a mom
9372969 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9372970 i just put down the blackberrys and pick up the breast pump
9372971 having had two children at home at the age of four months i know how much help they need even without unfortunate medical conditions
9372972 i really feel mother knows best without the peanut gallery giving unsolicited advice she strongly conveys to women today that you dont have to choose between a successful career and motherhood you do have to make sacrifices but you can have it all
9372973 i would just trust that the child is not neglected in any way there are millions of women who work why is it that the father cannot provide the same standard of care there has been an evolving view of working women even in conservative christian circles
9372974 i didnt think the republicans would pick a female candidate for another decade but john mccain is not a typical conservative leader
9372975 whites stunning second crime novel to feature ex cop and ex pi jackson donne fulfills the promise of his debut
9372976 intricate plotting and nonstop action make this a nail biting read from start to finish white is a writer to watch
9372977 scenes of donnes mothers decline however are knowing and movingly written and the gritty new jersey locale seems an ideal setting for portraying the evil that men do
9372978 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled
9372979 white has created an appealing character in donne and the plot flies between the events in the 1940s and explosions kidnappings and murders in the present
9372980 one of the best new crime writers to come out of the u s of a feel free to hate him
9372981 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
9372982 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
9372983 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
9372984 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart
9372985 when one man dies barrels straight out of the old school and swerves onto the highway that will take detective fiction where its going next dave white has one hand on the wheel the other on the gear shift and his foot on the floor
9372986 fast and funny with plenty of classic action but a setting and character that are entirely new dave white is creating a winner with jackson donne
9372987 when one man dies heralds the introduction of two astonishing new figures in the crime fiction world new jersey pi jackson donne whose emotional journey will break your heart and author dave white whose voice has the confidence and assurance many more established writers would kill for

9373022 dont focus on the tools and the direct application of the tools focus on what the tools allow us to do better and then find a way to implement that functionality
9373023 the difference between web 2 0 and enterprise 2 0 is like the difference building a tunnel through rock and tunnel under water the enterprise 2 0 tunnel is built under water this takes more engineering understanding but it also requires more fault testing and assurances a crack or crumbling of a tool inside an organization is not seen kindly and raises doubts around the viability of the tool web 2 0 does not work well in enterprise but the approaches and understandings of web 2 0 modified for enterprise work really well

9373026 academics tend to err on the side of nuance and precision eschewing generalizations and coarse labels this is great for documenting cultural dynamics but not so great for making interventions creating an impression an image in the minds of those who are fearful requires more than accurate data it requires a compelling story and a framework that can replace the boogie monster combating pre existing images requires more than accuracy more than nuance it requires either a new more sticky image or a reworking of the original image
9373027 psychologists and neuroscientists have recently become fascinated by the human predilection for storytelling why does our brain seem to be wired to enjoy stories and how do the emotional and cognitive effects of a narrative influence our beliefs and real world decisions the answers to these questions seem to be rooted in our history as a social animal we tell stories about other people and for other people stories help us to keep tabs on what is happening in our communities the safe imaginary world of a story may be a kind of training ground where we can practice interacting with others and learn the customs and rules of society and stories have a unique power to persuade and motivate because they appeal to our emotions and capacity for empathy

9373235 tras participar en un estudio financiado por la comisi n europea que analiz la forma de ense ar en pa ses europeos y latinoamericanos el psic logo espa ol juan ignacio pozo se form una idea muy clara
9373236 antes en el colegio uno se enteraba de muchas cosas de las que no se pod a enterar en otra parte pero eso se acab hoy los alumnos reciben informaci n de muchas otras fuentes y la misi n de la escuela debiera ser ayudarles a digerir esos datos y convertirlos en conocimiento
9373237 si el profesor se concibe a s mismo como alguien que entrega saber y no como quien ayuda a encontrarlo va a seguir desprestigi ndose pues no puede competir con las nuevas tecnolog as
9373238 es que para cambiar la educaci n no basta con cambiar las normas las leyes los preceptos hay que cambiar la cultura de los centros las pr cticas educativas de los docentes y la concepci n que tienen los profesores y los alumnos acerca de lo que debe pasar en el aula
9373239 hay tres niveles uno es hacer cambios en la pol tica educativa que afecten la carrera docente otro generar centros educacionales m s participativos y se requiere un modelo distinto de formaci n docente que ayude a los profesores a resolver los problemas del aula actual no la de hace 30 a os porque hoy la escuela ense a contenidos del siglo xix con profesores del siglo xx a alumnos del siglo xxi
9373240 las universidades deben poner en marcha los modelos en los que creen el problema es que en educaci n las teor as son m s dif ciles de trasladar a la pr ctica porque lo que hay que cambiar no es una t cnica rutinaria sino la mentalidad del docente hoy cada escuela es una realidad distinta no hay t cnicas que funcionen siempre se requiere un docente que sepa adaptar la teor a a la realidad en la que trabaja
9373241 no digo eso sino que la t cnica ya no es suficiente antes los profesores aprend an ciertos m todos que resultaban siempre pero eso era en una poca en que la educaci n era m s selectiva donde los alumnos que no respond an a ese patr n simplemente eran excluidos ahora la escuela recibe a todos los estudiantes y no hay recetas universales el aula es cada vez m s impredecible y el docente debe estar siempre buscando nuevas soluciones

9373351 a screw up on the part of our research team
9373352 our supporters our staff get overzealous they start saying things that i would not say
9373353 it is my responsibility to make sure that were setting a clear tone in our campaign
9373354 hes going to have to master the art of being able to keep individuals motivated
9373355 so that they dont feel heartbroken because something they were told during the primary phase is something that hes going to have to take a different position on in the general election
9373356 i understand why he needs to do it i dont agree with it but im still with him 100 percent
9373357 i cant imagine the obama team will spend their time on palin theyll spend their time with their negative ads attacking mccain and bush
9373358 you always have to be careful not to rally people to her side by attacking too much
9373359 i think the public pretty much accepts the fact that they played pretty dirty and that sexism played a role in the primary
9373360 what does it say that he knuckled under to the right wing of his party who angrily threatened to veto mccains preferred candidates joe lieberman and tom ridge for their pro choice views
9373361 what does it say that in order to satisfy the right he hastily selected someone he barely knew and had only met once to serve a heartbeat away from the presidency
9373362 they dont know how big boys play hard in the big city
9373363 i think the clinton campaign has heightened the sensitivity of women about any kind of implied or inferred slight
9373364 what does it say that he knuckled under to the right wing of his party who angrily threatened to veto mccains preferred candidates joe lieberman and tom ridge for their pro choice views
9373365 what does it say that in order to satisfy the right he hastily selected someone he barely knew and had only met once to serve a heartbeat away from the presidency
9373366 the natural reminder here is o j simpson how does an african american candidate attack a white woman

9373370 and of course as governor she has had enormous responsibilities none of which senator obama had when she was in government he was a community organizer when she was taking tough positions against her own party senator obama was voting present 130 times in the state legislature on every tough issue whatever it was she was taking them on thats the kind of judgment that im confident that we need in washington
9373371 i think the public pretty much accepts the fact that they played pretty dirty and that sexism played a role in the primary
9373372 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base

9373389 foreign born players are needed here and they help enhance the united states global image and competitiveness

9373420 we dont have that in the country where i live
9373421 not a lot of green here they should come with airplanes and put water on the land every day for 4 weeks and it would be green then we could use the land
9373422 in my country there is also a lot of rain and it is also very green but we cant see the beauty of the nature because the sky is grey all the time and we never see any sun without the sun there are no colours and everything is dark and depressing in jordan the sun shines every day so every day you see the beauty of nature

9373439 all senator obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9373440 shes vetoed legislation shes taken on corruption and in her party and won she took on the oil companies and won she administered a budget successfully
9373441 is the least experienced candidate for president in the last 100 years
9373442 i mean hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business hes never administered a payroll hes never led people in crisis
9373443 is a little bit like opening a door and letting some fresh alaska air into washington
9373444 i think here he wanted to send the message get somebody fresh somebody really who represents the other america outside of washington where people dont care whether you have an r or a d after your name they just want you to get something done to help them deal with the problems they have
9373445 a woman trying to balance her work life and her family life not to mention her incredible track record of reform and taking on as she said the good old boy network
9373446 i think frankly the democratic party has done a disservice to women by trying to hold women hostage to the issue of roe v wade
9373447 the truth is the most important issue to women all the polls say this is the economy women are not single issue voters yes there are some women for whom the issue of reproductive rights trumps everything else but the truth is most women are not that way
9373448 she risked her political career to take on the special interests in her own party she took on the oil companies shes like mccain mccain wants to change this campaign from change to from left to right he wants to make it im going to clean out the stables
9373449 do people want a risky president the pluses and minuses are huge in this pick and thats why were talking about it
9373450 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9373451 we are 1 000 percent better prepared today than we were before katrina
9373452 we have the full resources of the federal government prepositioned supplies and equipment communications equipment and the resources of the united states military already on the scene helping to evacuate sick patients from hospitals
9373453 so we are as ready as you could possibly be what we have to hope and pray of course is that the storm does not go beyond the capacity of the levees to protect new orleans and the rest of the gulf coast
9373454 on friday august 31 2001 the sunshine seemed to dim laughter faded away and there was a little less joy in the world because deputy hagop jake kuredjian was taken from us a deranged man wielding a rifle took his life in a brief moment of time leaving his family and an army of friends to mourn his loss in the short time since his tragic death at 40 years old i have been overwhelmed by the stories of how much life jake packed into the relatively short time he was with us if friends were counted as income jake was one of the richest men in the world while we cant help but grieve his passing i am determined to remember that million dollar smile and the fact he would give the shirt off his back to help a family member friend or stranger let us remember jake enjoying a good prank telling a joke or riding down the road on his harley please never forget that jake willingly put his life at risk to come to the aid of residents and law enforcement personnel who were in peril most of all if you have not already done so thank god for sharing jake with us even if just for a little while

9373462 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself coach bill belichick said of lynch who turns 37 on sept

9373465 el comod n de la administraci n ge ista es asad montelongo quien al perder las pasadas elecciones para senador recibi la consolaci n de una secretar a de estado para mantenerlo vivo en su proyecto pol tico pero lamentablemente ya es un cartucho quemado y dif cilmente podr a generar una buena cantidad de votos al pri en las pr ximas elecciones en caso de ser propuesto para alg n cargo de elecci n popular ya vimos que no es buen pol tico no obstante esta al frente de una importante secretar a del estado de tamaulipas
9373466 en materia educativa vemos el enorme rezago en materia de capacitaci n al magisterio tamaulipeco con niveles de aprovechamiento acad mico equiparables a pa ses africanos mal preparados y en algunos casos lamentablemente incompetentes
9373467 esa es la realidad de la educaci n en tamaulipas aunque tambi n debemos de reconocer los aciertos del gobierno estatal del impulso a otros programas de beneficio para quienes estudian la educaci n b sica como el programa de ingles la reforma educativa en la entidad el mejoramiento de la infraestructura educativa entre otros aspectos destacables

9373469 no podemos tener la misma pol tica p blica para todo el pa s sino que se tiene que recoger la necesidad de cada estado
9373470 se busca encontrar las estrategias id neas para obtener resultados qu sirve qu se necesita reorientar y de qu forma se pueden fortalecer m s los grupos de padres y la asistencia de ellos

9373478 el prop sito fue de analizar acciones que impulsen la transformaci n de pr cticas pedag gicas en beneficio del proceso de aprendizaje de los alumnos de preescolar dentro de la renovaci n curricular
9373479 ellos apoyan y asesoran en todo momento a los docentes frente a grupo y les proporcionan herramientas oportunas para que puedan desempe ar su funci n con equidad y calidad

9373482 she has experience not only in politics but in life
9373483 shes a mother of five children and she has more experience than barack obama
9373484 governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9373485 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9373486 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9373487 if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far more experience than senator obama does
9373488 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9373489 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9373490 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9373491 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9373492 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9373493 i think thats when the campaign for national office began
9373494 someone whos stopped government from wasting taxpayers money on things they dont want or need
9373495 someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies
9373496 someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9373497 someone who has reached across the aisle and asked republicans democrats and independents to serve in government
9373498 it would be hard not to appear conservative with the huge budget approved by the majority
9373499 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9373500 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9373501 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9373502 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9373503 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9373504 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9373505 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9373506 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9373507 human interest thats also my thing do you need someone to blog for you i would love to
9373508 reminded me of katy perrys hit musically though it will not get to that level of popularity
9373509 sounds like a single that could have come from any number of current r amp b singers
9373510 qued claramente establecido con el director de issstecali que no hay ninguna reforma ni mucho menos un intento de la misma y si la hubiera cualquier situaci n ser a platicada con el sindicato y con el congreso del estado
9373511 no haremos ninguna negociaci n a espaldas del trabajador y ah vamos a estar para defenderlos
9373512 durante los ltimos 8 no han subido el presupuesto sin embargo la poblaci n s viene creciendo y eso se traduce a una carencia inminente
9373513 no se puede estar pagando siempre con terrenos que son propiedad de los ayuntamientos
9373514 el gobierno del estado tiene adeudo as como los municipios junto con todas las paraestatales
9373515 porque si un paciente se toma un medicamento pensando que no le va a hacer la misma efectividad ciertamente no le hace pero es s lo por la voluntad psicol gica ante la medicina
9373516 por lo que no estoy de acuerdo en que sea el estado el que decida en torno al aborto
9373517 mi programa de trabajo incluye devolverles a o con a o a los trabajadores el dinero que los gobiernos dan para el fondo de ahorro ah hay mucho dinero para seguir prestando el dinero que llegue al sindicato lo necesitan m s los trabajadores tambi n vamos a recuperar beneficios que ya ten amos y que han desaparecido como el apoyo para uniformes escolares y los art culos escolares para nuestros hijos
9373518 porque hasta ahora nadie hab a dicho esta boca es m a es verdaderamente grave que ni las dirigencias estatal o seccional se manifiesten contra este atropello del gobierno
9373519 que quede claro desde que publicamos nuestro desplegado combatiendo las reformas a la ley de isstecali varios irresponsables se han colgado de este tema como si fuera una bandera de campa a electoral sindical cuando en realidad issstecali s tiene problemas econ micos fuertes y concretos
9373520 mientras que nosotros queremos involucrar a todos los interesados autoridades ayuntamientos descentralizadas maestros y por supuesto a la misma instituci n
9373521 hemos recorrido una por una las oficinas de los trabajadores y saludado personalmente a miles de bur cratas que nos alientan en el prop sito de sacudir a nuestro adormilado sindicato haremos una revoluci n sindical porque hasta ahora nunca se le ha devuelto nada a nuestra gente
9373522 aliviaremos la carga econ mica de nuestros compa eros devolvi ndoles algo de lo mucho que han aportado al sindicato
9373523 ese d a se resuelve algo m s que la simple elecci n del comit ejecutivo seccional se resuelve o se complica tambi n parte del problema de issstecali porque el que resulte electo tiene que atorarle con dureza y estrategia de modo que si el o la que elijamos no sabe c mo atacar el problema de issstecali perderemos todo
9373524 pues nosotros tenemos una participaci n electoral de m s del 80 por ciento del padr n nuestros bur cratas tienen voto libre directo y secreto
9373525 nos hace un ejemplo de sindicalismo pues no cualquier sindicato u organizaci n social se da el lujo de tener tanta participaci n entre sus votantes con nosotros dijo vota el 90 por ciento de la burocracia
9373526 el voto es secreto y nadie sabr por qui n se vota
9373527 con mucho esfuerzo realizan sus estudios as como la preparaci n f sica y mental
9373528 exigiremos al gobierno del estado y al issstecali que no se est escatimando en el presupuesto
9373529 tambi n son necesarias otras 2 cl nicas en tecate y rosarito
9373530 los medicamentos se han estado sustituyendo por similares y gen ricos
9373531 les pediremos a las autoridades del issstecali que no se est sacrificando calidad a costa del dinero
9373532 costar m s aliviar a todos los que presenten complicaciones por ingerir los medicamentos de calidad dudosa liquid el funcionario
9373533 en los medicamentos m s demandados es donde hemos tenido el mayor n mero de sustituciones por parte de la instituci n
9373534 los m dicos de este hospital que est n en el paro laboral son aproximadamente 30 o 35 algunos est n operando las cirug as no se cancelaron otros est n atendiendo en urgencias es por eso que no est n todos los m dicos en la explanada
9373535 a m se me inform fue un acuerdo que se tom en el colegio m dico y la federaci n de colegios en una reuni n que hubo en el hospital ngeles
9373536 se les ha dejado en una sola rea para evitar que exista soldados o polic as en todo el hospital
9373537 desde que inici en su cargo hemos tenido una serie de problemas en los que sentimos que ha confundido su funci n como director general porque pretende actuar como patr n de los afiliados al issstecali
9373538 despu s de estar al frente del issstecali durante estos casi cinco meses act a como si fuera patr n de una empresa y entrega las cuotas de cerca de 2 mil docentes jubilados en el estado al comit ejecutivo nacional del snte
9373539 hasta que no nos den el cheque no nos vamos
9373540 me preocupa que se hayan suspendido los cr ditos para trabajadores del sete y se hayan entregado nicamente a gente del snte aun cuando se acord que no se entregar an si no hab a para ambos sindicatos
9373541 sigue firme ese trato de equidad y se lo vamos a dar de este viernes en ocho vamos a dar los pr stamos solicitados
9373542 es falso que no se les atienda acuden a las instalaciones y son atendidos en tres ocasiones los he recibido y en m ltiples veces por el equipo de trabajo a nadie se les niega la atenci n si tiene derecho a ella no se les niega la medicina que requiere a los trabajadores que tienen derecho falso que el issstecali no se les d las jubilaciones a quien cumpla con los requisitos
9373543 la ley nos obliga a jubilar de acuerdo a lo que ah se establece a cualquier trabajador que haya cotizado 30 a os de servicio el issstecali tiene un tope presupuestal que s lo le permite jubilar 200 personas en el 2008 100 trabajadores de la educaci n y 100 de la burocracia la semana pasada en la junta directiva de isssstecali se lograron 50 nuevas jubilaciones para los trabajadores de la educaci n
9373544 no est en nosotros porque issstecali no es una autoridad laboral sino a otras de la esfera del gobierno si ustedes son sete o snte si corresponden a un sindicato o no corresponden a un sindicato ese es un tema que a nosotros no corresponde ante el issstecali ustedes son trabajadores de la educaci n en la exigencia de sus derechos y as es como son tratados
9373545 no son tan eficaces a la hora de los resultados
9373546 se nos gir un oficio por parte de la direcci n general para omitir cualquier tipo de comentario
9373547 hay una mala interpretaci n por parte de las autoridades del issstecali los compa eros no vienen a tomar ninguna oficina sino a que se les atendiera como trabajadores y asegurados que son sin distinci n de siglas sindicales
9373548 al no contar con el tal n de cheque tampoco tienen derecho al servicio m dico que le fue negado a nuestro compa ero quien a m s de una semana de estar enfermo solicit atenci n en issstecali pero fue rechazado
9373549 ya la delegaci n se est organizando para eso pero hay que se alar que esto no debe suceder porque estuvo en peligro la vida de un ser humano ante la negativa de esta instituci n de salud cuando deber a de haberlo atendido de inmediato
9373550 y el caso de este profesor est desde noviembre del 2006
9373551 nosotros hacemos aportaciones de nuestro bolsillo para apoyarlo un poco con los gastos y estamos en espera de que el gobierno haga lo que le corresponde pagarle a quien est trabajando no a los aviadores
9373552 tenemos todo debidamente sustentado existen listados donde firma el maestro aviador y estos registros de asistencia los pudieran verificar muy f cilmente qui n est realmente trabajando el delgado del see como el jefe de departamento pero no lo hacen
9373553 si bien depositaron unas condiciones de trabajo a un d a que nos entregaran la toma de nota de nuestro registro pero eso no es un contrato no tiene los elementos ni las firmas ni siquiera de las partes correspondientes
9373554 pero esto tiene que salir del tribunal mientras tanto hay otras maneras de ser imparcial y deber an de atender tanto al sete cuando tenga el derecho como al snte
9373555 deveras son de los actos que no haya uno c mo recompensarlos
9373556 no permitiremos ninguna reforma que afecte a los jubilados y activos de la burocracia
9373557 debemos utilizar cualquier instancia y cualquier medio de lucha para impedir que se nos quiten nuestras conquistas
9373558 s estamos de acuerdo en revisar la situaci n de issstecali en buscar mejorar todo aquello que no est funcionando adecuadamente en fortalecer nuestro instituto porque nos queda claro la importancia que tiene issstecali para nosotros y nuestras familias pero de eso a que perdamos lo que ya tenemos es otra cosa no daremos ni un paso atr s
9373559 no s que sentir a l despu s de estar trabajando d a a d a durante 30 a os o m s me parece que no sabe lo que dice pues desconoce las realidades de los trabajadores se imaginan a un bombero trabajando m s de 30 a os cuando su labor lo desgasta much simo m s que a cualquier otro trabajador seguramente se le hace poca cosa trabajar m s de 30 a os
9373560 aqu hay libertad de afiliaci n y la gran mayor a es adepto al snte y si a alg n compa ero no le satisface y deciden irse a otra instancia tampoco vamos a impedirlo
9373561 los ltimos sindicatos que se han generado es el de tabasco y de baja california los dem s son una membres a m nima
9373562 y en baja california se tendr a que hacer lo mismo en su momento con la participaci n de los sindicatos no s lo de la educaci n sino de otras instituciones de gobierno interesadas en hacer de issstecali una que garantice a los trabajadores una prestaci n social segura
9373563 porque no estamos para renunciar a lo que tenemos pero debemos ser concientes que es necesario tomar algunas decisiones que nos puedan asegurar una prestaci n de calidad
9373564 yo invitar a al sector privado que se sienten a platicar tambi n con los manifestantes porque ellos tienen derecho a atenderlos que dialoguen y vean cual es la importancia de sus peticiones
9373565 esta inversi n es sin duda una de las m s importantes en el quehacer gubernamental de la administraci n estatal porque invertir en educaci n se traduce en un beneficio directo de los ni os y adultos bajacalifornianos los que tambi n al final de cuentas constituyen la mayor riqueza y pilar para que siga engrandeci ndose baja california
9373566 siempre estaremos dispuestos a dar la cada y buscar soluciones por medio del di logo y la conciliaci n como se ha venido demostrando a lo largo de m s de tres a os de gobierno en donde se presenta un problema all estamos porque quien nada debe nada teme
9373567 es lamentable y reprobable que el alcalde samuel ramos flores fomente que se vulneren los derechos de los ciudadanos al expresar que apoya el plant n que se realiza frente a las oficinas del issstecali y que adem s brindar la seguridad necesaria para continuar
9373568 si bien es cierto que el derecho a la libre manifestaci n de las ideas es una prerrogativa de todo ciudadano tambi n lo es el no afectar derechos de terceras personas
9373569 claro que el alcalde es el responsable de todos los bloqueos que se realicen en la ciudad incluyendo el que en pr ximos d as se realizar en el centro c vico ya que es la m xima autoridad municipal y su obligaci n es hacer respetar las leyes as como los derechos de los ciudadanos y no alentar a ese tipo de manifestaciones
9373570 de lo contrario el alcalde correr el riesgo de verse como un alcalde d bil y parcial
9373571 esto nos ayudar para que no haya desabasto de medicinas faltan reas importantes cr ticas pero acerca de esto nos sentaremos a negociar
9373572 sin embargo como sociedad no podemos permitir que grupos cualquiera que sean virtualmente estrangulen las arterias que utilizamos todos hist ricamente este tipo de acciones como la manifestada en esa vialidad generan rechazo generalizado de la comunidad y finalmente los a sla como grupo
9373573 hemos interpuesto una denuncia pero los pleitos ni ganados son buenos dios nos dio la cabeza y la boca para usarlas
9373574 l qued de presentar estos asuntos ante la junta de gobierno de issstecali pero es hora que no se hace caso a nuestro derecho de petici n
9373575 quieren una silla del sete en la junta de gobierno quieren una clave de descuento con la leyenda de sete pero eso yo no se los puedo otorgar porque no hay capacidad inform tica adem s ellos no tienen la relaci n laboral no tienen representatividad jur dica y mientras no la logren ante las autoridades laborales para lo cual tengo entendido que han interpuesto un juicio nosotros no podemos otorgarles las prerrogativas que est n exigiendo
9373576 quieren dialogar poni ndome la pistola en la cabeza as no es posible
9373577 no somos ladrones s lo exigimos que se nos respeten nuestros derechos no nos vamos a llevar nada
9373578 no estamos secuestrando a nadie todo mundo que desee salir del edificio lo puede hacer hemos llamado a la autoridad la polic a municipal para que d fe de que no hay ning n secuestro
9373579 somos discriminados por el s lo hecho de pertenecer al sete
9373580 atendemos a m s de 2 mil personas entre jubilados pensionados por viudez por orfandad y de ascendencia nos est n quitando el dinero de todos
9373581 esto me huele mucho a pol tica es una situaci n m s o menos similar a lo que ocurri en el desfile ellos destacan su
9373582 considerar nefasta y traicionera a los intereses de los maestros
9373583 no permitiremos ninguna reforma que afecte a los jubilados y activos de la burocracia
9373584 debemos utilizar cualquier instancia y cualquier medio de lucha para impedir que se nos quiten nuestras conquistas
9373585 s estamos de acuerdo en revisar la situaci n de issstecali en buscar mejorar todo aquello que no est funcionando adecuadamente en fortalecer nuestro instituto porque nos queda claro la importancia que tiene issstecali para nosotros y nuestras familias pero de eso a que perdamos lo que ya tenemos es otra cosa no daremos ni un paso atr s
9373586 no s que sentir a l despu s de estar trabajando d a a d a durante 30 a os o m s me parece que no sabe lo que dice pues desconoce las realidades de los trabajadores se imaginan a un bombero trabajando m s de 30 a os cuando su labor lo desgasta much simo m s que a cualquier otro trabajador seguramente se le hace poca cosa trabajar m s de 30 a os
9373587 es importante hacer un alto en el camino para lograr buscar distintas soluciones
9373588 la informaci n que proporcion el presidente de la comisi n respectiva en el congreso est muy lejos de la realidad
9373589 hemos busca las reuniones para encontrar soluci n a este problema pero no ha habido eco por la autoridad quienes minimizan el problema
9373590 estamos conciliando el adeudo ya hicimos un pago de m s de 7 millones de pesos con un terreno pero falta lo correspondiente a lo que se acumul durante las anteriores administraciones
9373591 cuando termine mi compromiso con el ayuntamiento espero no dejar una deuda de ese tama o y que no se deba nada a nadie
9373592 desmiento categ ricamente que lo que se se al es cierto lo que se escribi fue aventurado
9373593 las dos mil 638 observaciones reportadas fueron hechas del conocimiento de los entes sujetos a fiscalizaci n en diferentes reuniones de preconfronta y confronta las que al no haber sido aclaradas por los mismos pasaron a formar parte del informe del resultado de la revisi n de la cuenta p blica 2003
9373594 lo que ocurri es que se cruz la informaci n entre el nter de que nosotros despachamos la informaci n y ellos la asf enviaron una comunicaci n al gobernador record ndole la situaci n
9373595 la verdad no s de d nde obtuvieron esa informaci n pero quien la haya prove do tan aventuradamente al decir que el estado desvi se me hace que es irresponsable es estar abonando al desprestigio de nuestro gobierno que francamente amerita ser reconocido en sus aciertos aunque se se alen errores
9373596 en cualquier tiempo que los recursos del instituto no bastaran para cubrir con las obligaciones a su cargo establecidas por esta ley el d ficit que hubiere ser cubierto por el estado y organismos incorporados en la proporci n a que a cada un corresponde
9373597 est previsto que los recursos del pafef son para fortalecimiento de estados est previsto que se destinen cantidades de esos recursos precisamente para sanear o proveer la cuesti n de las pensiones para los trabajadores del estado
9373598 se agarr esa lana y se le puso al instituto no hay ning n desv o sino por el contrario creo que el estado est respondiendo a una obligaci n que tiene de darle prevenci n social a los trabajadores del estado aunque stas como ya sabemos sean superiores a las proyecciones que tienen los trabajadores
9373599 no podemos agarrar 100 millones de un fondo y por nuestro arbitrio decir ponlo ac o all o m s all
9373600 el pan no lleg a enquistarse en el poder como lo hizo el pri con 70 a os de fraudes electorales
9373601 a toro pasado aqu lo que hacemos es verificar muy estrechamente las obras durante su ejecuci n antes en la licitaci n y luego al t rmino eso es transparentar y fiscalizar
9373602 de aqu a dos a os cuando se termine el sexenio todos vamos a rendir buenas cuentas el gobernador est preocupado en el m s m nimo detalle no vamos a dar paso atr s ni vamos a andar viendo de qu color es la persona que cometi una falta
9373603 si hay una falta no vamos a sancionar colores vamos a sancionar acciones de los servidores p blicos
9373604 no a la prepotencia del secretario general de la secci n 37 a la usurpaci n de funciones golpeteo y minizaci n a secretarios delegacionales a la indiferencia al r gimen de pensiones y jubilaciones y a los servicios m dicos del issstecali
9373605 con todos los presidentes municipales independientemente de su filiaci n estamos trabajando de manera conjunta en la misma manera de solucionar estos adeudos
9373606 lo que digo es que existe toda la certeza de que est claro abierto y aprobado por las juntas de gobierno correspondientes
9373607 de alguna forma u otra es de seguir estimulando la educaci n en los tres a os se han entregado m s de 57 mil y este a o 27 mil becas
9373608 buscamos que la pr xima administraci n municipal no tenga las mismas condiciones financieras adversas como la recibimos nosotros
9373609 nuestra exigencia primordial es la soluci n definitiva al problema que aqueja a issstecali en cuanto a los servicios m dicos y medicamentos as como el correcto pago de nuestra prima de antig edad que desde 1989 no se ha pagado correctamente
9373610 estamos en la lucha esperando que se resuelva correctamente el secretario de la secci n 37 ya ha tomado cartas en el asunto
9373611 las entidades federativas en particular baja california tienen ya serios conflictos con las instituciones de seguridad social que como el issstecali generan gastos al estado son problemas que tienen que ver con las pensiones especialmente para con los maestros que deber n encontrar una soluci n similar a la encontrada por la universidad
9373612 por qu lo permiten por qu no obligan a que les paguen si no lo hacen esto va a repercutir en contra de los derechohabientes
9373613 la traslaci n del dominio en cuanto a la posesi n nos la entreg el municipio de los bienes y se est promoviendo un desarrollo que pueda traducirse en recursos inmediatos para issstecali
9373614 pero nunca lo han regresado no nada m s catal n lo hizo manuel montenegro oscar s nchez del palacio y dem s ex alcaldes
9373615 aqu se aprovechan los presidentes municipales al canjear los adeudos por terrenos
9373616 los dirigentes sindicales asegur no han hablado con los jubilados y s lo enviaron un oficio en el que hacen saber que los van a defender aunque ya son varias ocasiones en las que han disimulado sus decisiones
9373617 a quienes pretendan acceder a la pensi n les ira peor tendr n que trabajar cuando menos 20 a os en lugar de los actuales y contar con 65 a os de edad m nima en lugar de los 55 a os de edad
9373618 no queremos nada con el doctor king queremos la cita directa con miguel ngel pretendemos ir a la asamblea sindical de bur cratas para obtener apoyo de la base pues ellos alegan falta de presupuesto si catal n en el 2002 pag los 90 millones de presupuesto que deb a a issstecali y en el 2003 asign otros 90 millones la pregunta es d nde qued ese dinero
9373619 son muy respetables las inquietudes y quejas que ha presentado la agrupaci n pero aclar que el instituto d a con d a hace un esfuerzo para cubrir las necesidades de los usuarios debido a que existe una mayor demanda del servicio porque la gente ya no va tanto al m dico particular por la falta de recursos econ micos
9373620 czy pieni dze te nie zosta y wyrzucone w b oto

9373623 nosotras las mujeres queremos demostrar la fortaleza que tenemos el car cter nosotras como formadoras del pensamiento y car cter de esta sociedad queremos demostrar la fortaleza y dignidad de la mujer
9373624 esta es una lucha aut ntica por nuestros derechos laborales
9373625 hoy nos reunimos para hacer un reconocimiento a los alumnos que participaron en la prueba enlace en el a o 2007 y cuyos resultados fueron los mejores en el mbito estatal
9373626 tambi n hemos invitado a sus maestros y padres de familia como una manera de reconocerles tambi n su participaci n para que sus alumnos y sus hijos hayan logrado obtener buenas calificaciones en el examen
9373627 por permitir que personal ajeno al see impartiera y diera clases
9373628 permitir y autorizar que personal ajeno al sistema educativo estatal see labore e imparta clases poner a personal con funciones administrativas o de apoyo a la educaci n como docentes frente a grupo en diferentes asignaturas
9373629 no permitir la aplicaci n de ex menes en su plantel perjudicando el derecho de los maestros de obtener la puntuaci n correspondiente y obstaculizando los procedimientos del programa adem s de no firmar las c dulas de la mayor a de su personal
9373630 hay salones con enciclomedias en escuelas cuyas calles ni siquiera est n pavimentadas hay ni os que se duermen en los mesabancos por desnutrici n los desayunitos del dif que son vendidos no ayudan en nada en lugar de preocuparse por cuestiones pol ticas la gente del snte deber a ver la realidad de los estudiantes en las aulas
9373631 la directora present cartas de abandono de empleo pero el anterior delegado juan jos ramos aguilera dio carpetazo a todo porque estaba en acuerdo con el snte y para que los alumnos no se quedaran sin clases decidimos cubrir esas horas trabajando de siete a siete del d a
9373632 ya informamos a las autoridades que vamos a cubrir esos huecos hasta el 31 de enero y esperamos que estos maestros regresen o env en a nuevos porque lo que se quiere es que los muchachos no pierdan clases independientemente del problema sindical
9373633 ning n primero tiene maestros de matem ticas ahorita y estamos haciendo lo posible por cubrir porque la titular se fue en apoyo a los dem s pero a partir del 1 de febrero los alumnos van a recibir nicamente a los maestros que estamos en la escuela porque hemos decidido no trabajar m s por otros que siguen cobrando
9373634 y como est n por salir de secundaria les va a afectar su ingreso a la preparatoria porque se avecinan los ex menes y entonces ser m s dif cil entrar si los alumnos no llevan buenas bases

9373636 porque de hacerlo seguro votar n por aprobar de inmediato la reforma al issstecali a cambio de unas propiedades en el corredor 2000 y aunque el partido de los maestros y de elba esther gordillo est en alianza con acci n nacional el ambiente que existe en el pa s por la ley del issste no les es nada favorable y muy probablemente se la cobren el 5 de agosto el que dej buena impresi n ante empresarios de la coparmex fue jorge ramos quien expuso con amplitud sus propuestas de gobierno de ganar las elecciones ante jacobo ackerman presidente del organismo expuso sus ejes principales de gobierno el que ya suma su experiencia a la campa a del ingeniero jorge hank es nada m s y nada menos que el arquitecto fernando zamora rubio quien lleg al bunker de campa a literalmente a
9373637 eugenio elorduy walther ha atropellado la ley hacia el trabajador del sete al no permitir el pago de salarios a dos mil profesores de base e interinos

9373640 ni por v a departamento de secundarias del sistema educativo estatal see ni por la supervisi n de zona o sindical se me avis y tambi n el pasado lunes estos docentes se fueron sin avisar
9373641 yo actu conforme a la ley reportando de manera oficial de la inasistencia de los profesores pero tambi n tengo desde el 03 y del 18 de octubre de muchas faltas que el see no ha mandado descontar
9373642 zamora l pez trat de dispersar a las alumnas de la cancha pero al ver que no le hicimos caso orden a los estudiantes que entraran a la cancha a jugar y en una mitad est bamos nosotras y en la otra ellos

9373644 el sistema educativo lo que hace es recibir las propuestas del snte y sete pero como el sindicato nacional tiene el contrato colectivo se le da preferencia mientras que al sete los retienen en tanto no ganen dicho contrato
9373645 con eso no se resuelve la situaci n de los maestros lo que quiero pedirles es que volvamos al cauce
9373646 nos ofrecemos para buscar a trav s de la secretar a general de gobierno y los propios diputados federales que est n en disposici n para ello para ser cauce de las inquietudes
9373647 incorporamos a maestros del sindicato nacional debido a las faltas constantes por parte de los maestros del sete ocasionando que los adolescentes no tuvieran clases
9373648 que las instancias de la secretar a de educaci n como el jur dico relaciones laborales y contralor a hagan investigaciones se deslinden responsabilidades y se aplique la sanci n a quien corresponda
9373649 jard n de ni os josefa ortiz de dom nguez
9373650 hasta el momento no tenemos denuncias pero s tenemos identificado el problema si los padres no denuncian nosotros no podemos intervenir y hacer valer un derecho que ellos mismos no est n dispuestos a ejercer en representaci n de sus hijos
9373651 tambi n se busca promover la autogesti n y vinculaci n con las diferentes instancias gubernamentales y sociales para coadyuvar con la autoridad educativa en beneficio de la comunidad escolar
9373652 el cese es tajante representa la culminaci n de la relaci n laboral
9373653 es un ainjusticia lo que est n haciendo con el director
9373654 en nuestra escuela no se cobraron cuotas nosotros acordamos nuestras propias cuotas voluntarias en efectivo especie o mano de obra seg n las posibilidades de las familias
9373655 escuelas de puertas siempre abiertas 2008 que tuvo su sede en esta ciudad se al que los maestros no son rateros por lo que se deben transparentar las cuotas escolares debido a que las necesidades son muchas y los recursos aportados por el gobierno insuficientes
9373656 indiscutiblemente tendremos que plantear de cara a la sociedad que la educaci n es tarea de todos necesitamos ayuda de los empresarios compartir experiencias desde la educaci n superior con b sica y queremos m s recursos que se trasladen a la calidad educativa
9373657 solamente transparentando el manejo de las cuotas porque los recursos no los manejan los maestros sino las asociaciones de padres de familia y hay que regularlo bien transparentarlo porque s lo as nos vamos a evitar conflictos
9373658 escuelas de puertas siempre abiertas 2008 que tuvo su sede en esta ciudad se al que los maestros no son rateros por lo que se deben transparentar las cuotas escolares debido a que las necesidades son muchas y los recursos aportados por el gobierno insuficientes
9373659 indiscutiblemente tendremos que plantear de cara a la sociedad que la educaci n es tarea de todos necesitamos ayuda de los empresarios compartir experiencias desde la educaci n superior con b sica y queremos m s recursos que se trasladen a la calidad educativa
9373660 solamente transparentando el manejo de las cuotas porque los recursos no los manejan los maestros sino las asociaciones de padres de familia y hay que regularlo bien transparentarlo porque s lo as nos vamos a evitar conflictos
9373661 estamos de acuerdo en que los padres de familia nos apoyen pero no que se les llame a las cuotas como si fuera un cobro sino que lo hagan dentro de sus posibilidades
9373662 el gobierno del estado y los diputados dar n la soluci n
9373663 confi en que no sea una tarea de persecuci n
9373664 no estamos de acuerdo en que los hayan cesado y vamos a buscar su defensa sin que signifique que estemos de acuerdo en el condicionamiento de las cuotas
9373665 yo le digo al gobernador que si de verdad quiere cesar a los maestros por sostener las escuelas el primer error fue que no hubo antes di logo con el sindicato por lo que en agosto vamos a convocar a todos los directores para que participen y expongan en que condiciones est n operando si es que les llega el apoyo institucional y si los insumos que reciben son deber s buenos
9373666 perseguir a los formadores de valores y de conciencias de nuestros ni os por parte del gobernador de la educaci n entonces no es congruente tomo una decisi n pol tica que se puede arreglar antes de que pase el tiempo que a la mejor en agosto se tendr a que realizar por eso hago responsable al gobierno del estado de lo que pase al iniciar el ciclo escolar pero espero que antes que llegue el ciclo se llegue a un buen acuerdo de trabajar juntos
9373667 yo le digo al gobernador que si de verdad quiere cesar a los maestros por sostener las escuelas el primer error fue que no hubo antes di logo con el sindicato por lo que en agosto vamos a convocar a todos los directores para que participen y expongan en que condiciones est n operando si es que les llega el apoyo institucional y si los insumos que reciben son deber s buenos
9373668 perseguir a los formadores de valores y de conciencias de nuestros ni os por parte del gobernador de la educaci n entonces no es congruente tomo una decisi n pol tica que se puede arreglar antes de que pase el tiempo que a la mejor en agosto se tendr a que realizar por eso hago responsable al gobierno del estado de lo que pase al iniciar el ciclo escolar pero espero que antes que llegue el ciclo se llegue a un buen acuerdo de trabajar juntos
9373669 esos directores van hacer cesados y ya le ped al sindicato que ni las manos metan por ellos
9373670 estamos un esfuerzo muy importante para que ning n joven se quede sin espacio fundamentalmente con cecyte y cobach donde estamos identificando las reas de mayor demanda para plantear extensiones es decir que los subsistemas puedan trabajan en una secundaria o en alguna escuela de otro nivel por ejemplo en el turno vespertino y poder atender a los j venes
9373671 creemos que podemos atender a todos tenemos ser responsables y utilizar la infraestructura al m ximo hom
9373672 supe que el reclamo de ella es en el sentido que los expedientes est n fundados en derecho y quiero decirles que as estamos actuando
9373673 con el incremento de recursos no habr ning n pretexto
9373674 como parte de los instrumentos de difusi n que el see puso en marcha en d as pasados para que los padres de familia y ciudadan a en general se enteren que del 1 al 15 de febrero se llevar a cabo el periodo de inscripciones a educaci n b sica
9373675 es un tema que no operar en el estado por lo menos en este a o
9373676 el decreto 344 indica que los directivos recibir n sanciones o c rcel si reciben cualquier cooperaci n voluntaria y eso se nos hace que nos falta a la dignidad como directoras porque nosotros tenemos muchos a os resolvi ndole los problemas al see
9373677 entonces para cumplir con esa disposici n que el gobierno nos impone el sistema educativo deber de sostener a las escuelas en un cien por ciento ahora hay planteles sin agua de beber y papel sanitario que es lo b sico
9373678 tambi n se cubren las actividades extraescolares organizadas por la escuela fuera del horario de clases
9373679 la educaci n es la mejor herencia que le podemos dejar a nuestros hijos por ello en ste gobierno nos esforzamos por construir un sistema educativo que permita el progreso de las nuevas generaciones
9373680 para el gobierno del estado la educaci n es su principal tarea baja california tiene una herencia y una rica tradici n educativa que es necesario cuidar con el prop sito de que las oportunidades de progreso est n al alance de todos
9373681 el gobernador del estado me ha dado instrucciones sta ma ana para que los reci n egresados de la normal fronteriza de tijuana entren a un concurso de selecci n para integrarse a las plazas para maestros
9373682 las sesiones se dar n de marzo a junio en jornadas sabatinas de 08 00 a 17 00 horas teniendo como sede la escuela secundaria no
9373683 con esta conferencia se pretende que los j venes vean el alcance e impacto de sus decisiones para que puedan entender con conciencia y responsabilidad las consecuencias de sus actos
9373684 se busca encontrar las estrategias id neas para obtener resultados qu sirve qu se necesita reorientar y de qu forma se pueden fortalecer los grupos de padres y la asistencia de ellos
9373685 tenemos que entender que somos iguales es como si tuvi ramos diferente color de ojos pelo o la forma de ver la vida pero todos somos parte de la sociedad
9373686 hoy tenemos que entender que existen personas diferentes y que cada una tiene un estilo propio de aprender
9373687 encuentro de experiencias educativas en torno al programa de educaci n preescolar
9373688 la funci n directiva en el impulso de los procesos de mejora educativa
9373689 este evento forma parte de una de las acciones prioritarias en atenci n a la reforma de la ense anza preescolar la cual contempla dentro de sus orientaciones brindar espacios para el an lisis y reflexi n sobre la pr ctica docente
9373690 ellos podr n a expresar sus opiniones acerca de que les ha significado la experiencia de trabajar con el programa de educaci n preescolar manifestando sus sugerencias y peticiones para mejorar el trabajo en el aula y la escuela
9373691 primero estudiamos entre de cenizas ahora soportamos el fr o y hace algunos d as las lluvias
9373692 el see con esto asegura la vigencia de la actual base de datos estatal de alumnos disminuyendo de modo sustancial tr mites tiempo uso de papel y un avance en la iniciativa del traslado de documentaci n por medios electr nicos escuela gobierno
9373693 se ha hecho un gran esfuerzo para que los maestros sean los mejor pagados del pa s de tal manera que el 94 del presupuesto total de la secretar a de educaci n se va a n mina por lo que s lo el 6 se destina a todo lo dem s
9373694 el an lisis de la secretar a y los maestros que nos ayudan concluy que estos dos son los que menos efectos tienen correspondientes a la parte de sexualidad como lo consideraba la copase y otros grupos
9373695 ten amos esperanzas de que tomaran una buena decisi n pero no y esto afectar a miles de ni os de 11 y 12 a os desorientados porque los libros no enfatizan en la abstinencia que prevendr a embarazos no planeados y enfermedades de transmisi n sexual
9373696 existe mucho inter s de todos los integrantes del consejo y de los directivos del sistema educativo estatal por participar en el mejoramiento de la educaci n en baja california por medio de ideas y a trav s de la participaci n de los padres de familia maestros y empresarios
9373697 este programa se origin en 1996 a ra z de un foro de consulta donde maestros padres de familia y empresarios coincidieron en la prioridad de incluir el ingl s en la curr cula de educaci n primaria
9373698 para ello se utilizan l minas ilustraciones y pinturas para que imagine cree sugiera y relacione basando la din mica de aprendizaje en la observaci n
9373699 asegur que para los docentes existe un foro de opini n que est abierto de manera permanente del cual podr n recibir asesor as de maestros especialistas en el contexto cient fico y valoral
9373700 aqu lo que llama la atenci n es que se trata de personas que ya transitaron por bastantes a os de un proceso de educaci n formal donde se supone que el sistema educativo de los diferentes niveles debi haberlos formados entre otras virtudes y valores con el valor de la honestidad
9373701 es uno de los elementos fundamentales para quien aspira a desarrollarse como un profesionista y me parece que aqu el sistema fall pero tambi n tiene que ver con la formaci n de valores en la familia y ah tambi n algo pas
9373702 en una sociedad que como la nuestra que estamos en una transici n hacia una democracia m s perfecta y desarrollada la honestidad es fundamental
9373703 la cl nica de urgencias del hospital del issste en tijuana se est modernizando se construir la cl nica de rosarito otra en san felipe y tambi n se actualiza el equipo m dico en ensenada
9373704 gracias a la nueva ley del issste se han generado m s recursos econ micos y al estado le ha llegado dinero para beneficio de todos los que m s lo necesitan y eficientizar la atenci n m dica
9373705 ellos dar n los talleres sobre el tema de lo que es el
9373706 con la pasada ley del issste el profesor se jubilaba a los 28 a os de vida laboral en el caso de las mujeres y 30 en lo hombres y la nueva ley trabajar hasta los 60 a os en varones y 58 las damas que es todav a una edad productiva
9373707 es muy lamentable que se presenten este tipo de cosas que haya partidos pol ticos que est n apoyando a los profesores debido a que ya estamos en campa as pol ticas y despu s las elecciones la verdad es un tema delicado en donde no deber a haber nadie m s que los profesores involucrados
9373708 sabe que todos tenemos que comer y que haremos hasta lo imposible por recibir nuestro cheque por eso nos hacen dar vueltas y vueltas para que perdamos la esperanza y dejemos el plant n
9373709 lo m s delicado es que en el caso de las dos secciones son situaciones intersindicales son internas del sindicato
9373710 definitivamente todos los actos que se hagan para promover la consolidaci n de un grupo pol tico sindical va a tener sus efectos en el buen curso de la educaci n en ese sentido la secretar a de educaci n y el gobierno del estado tienen una responsabilidad
9373711 m s que involucrarse tiene que ver con la responsabilidad de gobierno lo que debe quedar muy claro es que nunca nos hemos involucrado en el problema sindical eso lo tienen que resolver ellos desgraciadamente el curso que han seguido no ha sido exactamente para resolverlo salvo el de la secci n 37 que tiene un curso jur dico legal y las dos partes as lo han reconocido
9373712 hay una l nea muy delgada ellos han manifestado dos conceptos uno contra la nueva ley del issste y las implicaciones de sta que insisto es una reforma federal en el cual pues tiene que ver m s el congreso de la uni n y el ejecutivo federal que el propio ejecutivo estatal o la secretaria de educaci n
9373713 la otra y es algo que han manifestado permanentemente y que tiene que ver contra la l der nacional del sindicato tiene varias connotaciones connotaci n que tiene que ver con el gremio pero la connotaci n pol tica tambi n y eso lo hace especialmente complicado
9373714 creo que era muy importante fortalecer al issste a lo mejor el t rmino lastimosamente necesario
9373715 es algo que se deber estar viendo en el futuro pr ximo issstecali es una instituci n que funciona bien m dicamente pero que tambi n tiene algunas complicaciones con lo que tiene que ver con las jubilaciones de los trabajadores de la secci n 37 necesariamente en determinado momento se van a tener que retomar las pl ticas sobre la nueva ley de issstecali
9373716 es un problema sindical hubo una denuncia por parte de la directiva de la secci n 2 entiendo hasta d nde tuve las platicas con ellos que estuvieron buscando las pl ticas con los disidentes inclusive llegaron a ciertas etapas de negociaci n hasta donde s
9373717 la secci n 2 con los disidentes estuvieron permanentemente platicando a trav s de la representaci n nacional en el estado estuvieron trabajando con ellos al no llegar a ning n acuerdo ratificaron la denuncia
9373718 particularmente la secretar a de educaci n no esto fue entre las partes sindicales
9373719 de alguna manera la parte que te corresponde la haces
9373720 no lograron avanzar y ratificaron la denuncia seg n platicaba con el procurador a ra z de esto se llevaron las averiguaciones y se actu teniendo en cuenta el resultado de la averiguaci n
9373721 no tuvimos conocimiento hasta pr cticamente cuando ya se hab a definido
9373722 desde mi perspectiva y por la preocupaci n por el buen curso de la educaci n s efectivamente se complic la situaci n pero la misma justificaci n por parte de quienes acuden a la ley y en todo caso de las instituciones encargadas de eso y que tienen que actuar en ese sentido
9373723 tambi n debo manifestar que hay una normatividad que hay un cuerpo de leyes para los cuales solicitan la participaci n de las autoridades de las instancias correspondientes y se act e en consecuencia s tengo repercusiones evidentemente pero tambi n estoy de acuerdo que la ley est para cumplirla
9373724 a finales del ciclo hab amos avanzado bastante pero es malo decirlo a trav s de los descuentos hubo una reacci n y afortunadamente fuimos teniendo cada vez menor participaci n de los maestros disidentes y vamos a ver los efectos ahora a estos d as que vienen
9373725 s sucedi reconocemos que sucedi en algunos casos hicimos las verificaciones en las zonas en las escuelas y estaban cerradas despu s nos manifestaron maestros que ellos acudieron a la escuela estando cerrada asistieron a la supervisi n o a la jefatura de nivel ah se les tom su declaraci n y firmaron un documento donde ellos no hab an participado abrimos un espacio a trav s del reclamo de la dirigencia de la secci n 2 pero adem s abrimos una ventanilla dentro de cada una de las delegaciones para que los maestros participaran hubo maestros que hab an asistido a una cita m dica otros que estaban apoyando la olimpiada nacional hubo casos en que hubo descuentos pero en todo caso los vimos a trav s de la dirigencia sindical o de la ventanilla y les regresamos lo descontado
9373726 queriendo resolver o llegar a un acuerdo yo les he dicho conmigo h ganme un compromiso de que no me van a faltar a las clases y yo no hago descuentos
9373727 la otra de las cosas si observamos que se cede el justo medio que hay formas la misma secretar a les ha dicho nosotros estamos dispuestos tenemos una mesa en la general de gobierno el propio secretario est dispuesto siempre y cuando est n dispuestos a ceder el justo medio t te sientas a una mesa a negociar cuando las partes van a soltar parte de su pretensiones y estableces el justo medio para negociar pero cuando hay cerraz n en este sentido y hay una posici n unilateral y te exigen pues no est s cediendo el justo medio
9373728 son 8 meses especialmente complicados as lo acept cuando me ofrecieron la posibilidad por el granito de arena que le puedes poner a la educaci n pero tambi n estos 8 meses me he dedicado a todas estas implicaciones pol tico sindicales y siempre te queda la preocupaci n por haber trabajado en lo sustancial de la secretar a que es lo educativo durante ya casi los 6 a os dentro de la secretar a siempre pens que deb a dedicarle un porcentaje de mi tiempo a fortalecer los programas educativos valores cultura de la legalidad indicadores educativos fortalecer la equidad en las zonas rurales y aparentemente pens bamos que ten amos f rmulas desgraciadamente no ha habido tiempo para lo sustancial me queda la preocupaci n por eso y obviamente te queda la sensaci n de que te falta tiempo para ellos
9373729 ni un paso atr s ni un paso atr s
9373730 la intervenci n de la polic a se deriv del despojo que sufrieron los maestros
9373731 el desalojo s lo vino a reactivar la participaci n ese efecto fue el que hizo en la gente

9373735 para reconocer el desempe o del personal de apoyo y asistencia a la educaci n b sica adscrito a las oficinas centrales se utilizar un monto de 190 mil pesos para la prestaci n
9373736 ellos llegaron de manera intimidatorio y queriendo mover las puertas de acceso al edificio del sindicato que tenemos en custodia desde hace unos meses
9373737 acusamos a los elementos del comit regional del snte de ser los provocadores de los problemas al inicio de ciclo escolar
9373738 aplicar la ley no es agredir a alguien es s lo hacer valer el estado de derecho
9373739 hab a una denuncia por despojo y se constituy dicha denuncia se ratific investig se consign a un juez quien revis la consignaci n y gir las rdenes de desalojo no fue una acci n unilateral del gobierno del estado
9373740 en los cruces fronterizos no est n ni los diputados ni los senadores
9373741 tambi n tenemos el apoyo de nuestro secretario general de la delegaci n d i 50 mario alberto calzada becerra despu s de que realizamos un estudio en el mes de julio para conocer si era factible la instalaci n de una escuela primaria
9373742 nos quieren quitar la chamba cuando nosotros profesores con la ayuda de los padres de familia levantamos los muros que nos proporcion el see es un tanto raro que no reconozcan el trabajo que hicimos
9373743 nosotros estamos haciendo la talacha desde el pasado 27 de agosto con la ayuda de los tutores de los 150 ni os a levantar los cuatro salones con los que contamos tenemos fotograf as que as lo sustentan
9373744 iniciaron el pasado 27 de enero y culminaron el 14 de julio del presente a o y se impartieron en distintas sedes con una duraci n de 200 horas
9373745 capacitaci n para una gestar a de calidad a nuevos dirigentes
9373746 los invito a que unidos formalicemos un compromiso de trabajo institucional que nos permita dentro del marco estatutario mantener el liderazgo que requieren nuestros agremiados el liderazgo en la actualidad no es quien hable m s bonito sino quien d respuesta clara y precisa a las necesidades del grupo recuerden siempre que el xito no es la meta sino el camino honesto a la misma
9373747 que quede claro ahora y desde aqu hacemos responsable al gobierno del estado en las acciones que podamos emprender con toda la estructura de la dirigencia sindical y de ser necesario con los integrantes de la federaci n
9373748 malos manejos del grupo ahorro para el desarrollo social grupo magisterio ades en contubernio con el sindicato nacional de trabajadores de la educaci n snte dejan al descobijo a maestros

9373752 shows off some gruff singing and i must say i wished theyd have done that more throughout this album
9373753 has more of a punk feel to a lot if it with the catchy sing along chorus
9373754 i know where you live i know your car and your people and your house im going to get you bitch
9373755 oh my god i cant believe these old people are acting this way in response to what only children have done what gets me is that these same people that defend a childs stupidity also votes and theses same people look at you or i as defending our selves our loved ones and or our property we are looked at as bullies thus the catch 22
9373756 inframundo que sigue existiendo con los defectos hist ricos de las negociaciones oscuras entre gordillo y el gobierno federal las viejas pr cticas caciquiles y clientelares
9373757 sigue siendo un factor m s de los canjes y favores pol ticos este gobierno ha colocado ah el debate
9373758 todos saben qui n es la dirigente del sindicato y pese a ello hace lo que sea y no pasa nada por lo que otro rasgo es la impunidad

9373795 i think what we have been seeing on tv is very similar to what took place on radio during the depression in that both are about reassurance
9373796 just as hearing roosevelts words reassured americans that things were going to get better so does seeing barack obamas nomination this week offer reassurance to many of us that the best hopes and aspirations of the 1960s have not been lost what we have been seeing the past weeks reassures us that america has not been hopelessly diminished

9373813 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9373814 you know that the rulers of the world have power over them and the leaders have complete authority this however is not the way it shall be among you
9373815 no question about it we all need help to understand the bible and we cannot find the scriptural guidance we need outside the faithful and discreet slave organization
9373816 your attitude toward the anointed is the determining factor whether you go into everlasting cutting off or everlasting life
9373817 unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that god is using we will not progress along the road to life no matter how much bible reading we do
9373818 the serving of food the right sort of food at the proper time was the issue it had to be according to this that a decision must be rendered by the returned master down to 1919 c e they had endeavored to give food at the proper time to the household of faith or the domestics of the heavenly master but the quality of the food itself was to be considered in this respect the body of hated persecuted christians who always sought to be faithful slaves of jesus christ met the test
9373819 thou wilt lengthen out leviathan the locomotive with a hook automatic coupler and a snare coupling pin which will cause his tongue coupling link to drop down

9373822 even the republics will disappear in the fall of 1920 every kingdom of the earth will pass away be swallowed up in anarchy the three days in which pharaohs host pursued the israelites into the wilderness represent the three years from 1917 to 1920 at which time all of pharaohs messengers will be swallowed up in the sea of anarchy also in the year 1918 when god destroys the churches wholesale and church members by the millions the inheritance of desolation that will be christendoms after 1918 so will god do the successful revolutionary movement it shall be utterly desolated even all of it not one vestige of it shall survive the revenges of world wide all embracing anarchy in the fall of 1920 pg
9373823 and the mountains were not found even the republics will disappear in the fall of 1920 and the mountains were not found every kingdom of earth will pass away be swallowed up in anarchy
9373824 based upon the argument heretofore set forth then the old order of things the old world is ending and is therefore passing away and that the new order is coming in and that 1925 shall mark the resurrection of the faithful worthies of old and the beginning of reconstruction it is reasonable to conclude that millions of people now on earth will still be on earth in 1925 then based upon the promises set forth in the divine word we must reach the positive and indisputable conclusion that millions now living will never die
9373825 therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of abraham isaac jacob and the faithful prophets of old particularly those named by the apostle in hebrews 11 to the condition of human perfection
9373826 the time of the end embraces a period from 1799 a

9373829 thirty years later found a small group of men not associated with the adventists or affiliated with any of the religious sects of christendom studying the holy scriptures at pittsburgh allegheny pennsylvania u s a they studied independently so as to avoid looking at the bible through sectarian spectacles
9373830 the true doctrines of the bible had been so twisted throughout the period of apostasy that no clear vision of christs second presence would be possible until these doctrines themselves had been cleared up it was not yet gods due time to bring about his restoration of true worship
9373831 their faithfulness and spiritual wisdom in the masters service determines their worthiness to be put in charge of all the earthly belongings of their master
9373832 but the scriptures describe them as having unclean garments because of their long association with christian apostasy they had many practices characteristics and beliefs similar to the weed like sects of christendom so from 1914 to 1918 a period of fiery testing came upon them not unlike the ancient period of babylonish captivity of the jews back in 607 537 b c e all this came to pass in connection with transgression on their part in having the fear of man not conducting themselves in a strictly neutral way during the war years and being tainted with many religiously unclean practices
9373833 similarly in the year 1919 the lord jesus did return to his house and inspect the situation within it
9373834 it is unlawful to assert that the apostles preached before they possessed

9373887 the previous governor had like a 20 approval rating they were tired of this just relentless brute ignoring the public mentality then the fbi raids all she had to do was show up and she got elected
9373888 theres always been a little bit of an air of an opportunist about the governor
9373889 it would be incorrect to say the bill came from the governor
9373890 theres a real question whether shes a republican or a democrat
9373891 she has succeeded in her own limited policy agenda as a republican governor by having the democrat caucus in lock step with her
9373892 her administration had the appearance of paying absolutely no attention to any of the rest of the unglamorous side of government
9373893 whether it be dealing with human services public services highways all the routine aspects
9373894 id say that john mccain made a bold choice here
9373895 in gov palin john has found a maverick whos done exactly the same thing at the state level that hes done at the federal level
9373896 so i think what sen mccain is saying with this choice is were serious about shaking up the status quo in washington
9373897 john mccain has proven that hes not a maverick hes erratic
9373898 i think john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because hes chosen somebody who clearly does not meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9373899 for heavens sake the people who supported hillary clinton are not going to be seduced just because john mccain has picked a woman
9373900 shes a partner and a soul mate shes a reformer
9373901 i dont particularly enjoy the label maverick but when somebody takes on the old bulls in her own party runs against an incumbent governor of her own party stands up against the oil and gas interests i mean they really are so vital to the economy of her of the state of alaska i mean its remarkable its a remarkable person
9373902 she doesnt think like sen obama does that iran is a minor irritant she has been commander in chief of the alaska guard in fact as you know she has got a son who is getting ready to go
9373903 shes functioned as a governor shes the commander in chief of a national guard shes a former mayor shes the former chair of an energy commission in alaska which is one of the more high profile issues and operations in alaska
9373904 shes deeply involved in the energy issues which is really one of the foremost national security issues we have in our country in terms of its connection to transference of wealth to places like the middle east and russia and venezuela

9373997 das wort gottes im leben und in der sendung der kirche
9373998 mir scheint es ist nach wie vor sehr wichtig dass die gl ubigen alle einen zugang zur heiligen schrift bekommen der ihnen hilft sich im leben und in der vielfalt der heutigen aktualit t zurechtzufinden das wort gottes sollte ja so etwas wie eine orientierungshilfe sein f r das leben
9373999 die erschaffung der welt die vorsehung gottes in der geschichte in allem was geschieht auch die kenntnis des lebens jesu das sind dinge die so wichtig und zentral sind dass man die und die stehen in der heiligen schrift m sste man verdeutlichen und den menschen nahe bringen
9374000 das ist nicht ganz leicht weil die exegese heute ein ganz weites feld ist so dass heute viele menschen angst haben vor der heiligen schrift es f llt mir immer wieder auf wie etwa studierende die bibel fast als gefahr anschauen und auch viele menschen lieber zu b chern greifen die ihnen unmittelbarer von gott zu sprechen scheinen als es die bibel tut und hier glaube ich m sste man die menschen ermutigen
9374001 ich bin alttestamentler und so weit ich es als alttestamentler sehe sind da nicht so viele kontroverese themen da mir scheint eine viel wichtigere frage wie kann man die biblischen aussagen zum sprechen bringen das sind so reiche und menschlich dichte aussagen die in diesen biblischen b chern enthalten sind ich denke da an die psalmen da ist so viel an menschlicher und geistlicher erfahrung an glaubenserfahrung drin das muss zur geltung gebracht werden ich w rde sagen auch in der akademischen diskussion ist das nicht immer der fall man untersucht sie nach ihrer historischen bedeutung nach ihrer literarischen beschaffenheit das sind nat rlich wichtige fragen aber das ist immer alles noch im vorfeld es muss dazu kommen dass diese texte wie bei gedichten oder bei literarischen werken dass man die ganze kraft oder ich w rde sogar sagen die ganze wucht die da drin steht dass die zum strahlen gebracht wird da scheint mir ein gro er bedarf zu sein an guter vermittlung
9374002 leider ist es so dass darf man sagen ohne ungerecht zu sein dass die eine sehr enge art haben die bibel zu lesen es geht ja nicht nur darum dass man daraus verse zitieren kann sondern dass man den ganzen reichtum und gehalt der in diesen texten steht dass man das zur geltung bringt es versteht und daraus lebt

9374004 what i want to see is moshe and itzik doing this work
9374005 the guy who drained the swamps worked really hard and got paid peanuts so he told his kids to learn a better profession he said this just isnt worth it we want to show todays young men that construction work can be worthwhile
9374006 were talking about guys who are looking to make some money after their army service
9374007 if they stay with us for six months they receive a nis 4 000 grant from the government for working in a priority industry at that point most of the guys take the money and go off to travel in india or thailand or wherever
9374008 but we would like to see them stay on with us so we offer them further grants we hope that theyll see that if they do remain in this business they can go on to become work supervisors site managers etc there are possibilities
9374009 as in any business you dont start out as a manager when i first started out i was carrying bags of concrete
9374010 dont let them know i said so because theyll get a big head over it
9374011 i see how important it is for this country to develop its own workforce
9374012 but every jewish mother wants her son to become a lawyer or a doctor or anything but a construction worker so what does my wife say no way youre going to be an astronaut youre going to be a pilot youre going to be a computer engineer well you know what not everyone can be a doctor or a programmer so why not work in construction
9374013 you see those finished buildings over here i helped construct them when i look at those buildings i know that i helped build this country and thats a great feeling when a building is finished and you hand over the key to an apartment to someone who is going to make that their home its a tremendous feeling
9374014 when you suggest to a young man today that he go into the construction business
9374015 he answers what i should go become a schlepper people dont realize that this job is not nearly as physical as it used to be
9374016 i remember when i was 16 years old having to carry cinder blocks on my shoulder up several flights of stairs can you imagine do you know what its like to carry 450 of those things up stairs it takes all day nowadays though a crane picks up the whole lot of cinder blocks and puts them down wherever you need them while you take an elevator up its a different world
9374017 people think this is still the old style very labor intensive kind of construction work they dont realize how much the field has changed how mechanical it has become
9374018 theres this clich about a little boy walking with his father where his eyes light up and he says look daddy a soldier the thing is from a young age we all learn to view our soldiers as heroes as people to emulate and idolize well this may sound funny
9374019 but what i want to see is a little boys eyes lighting up and him saying look daddy a construction worker
9374020 i have another 25 years to go before my retirement
9374021 and i believe ill see this revolution completed by then

9374023 many foreigners occupy jobs like a tenant occupies a room
9374024 when the foreigner leaves his job it becomes vacant like a room does
9374025 the job room analogy does not hold true when the foreigner leaves he takes his job with him
9374026 it is a function of money the more the foreigner gets paid the better the chances that his job will be similar to a room which can be vacated for an israeli
9374027 it gave me a license to go out there and have a go
9374028 freddie flintoff led us well in the middle of the innings and put us back on track

9374030 i dont think youll like me for who i am so im going to try to buy your attention and affection
9374031 the process of inter country adoption in nepal has a lot of problems and loopholes and in many cases we can talk about some malpractices the best interest of the child is not the center piece of the current process and an important shift should be encouraged
9374032 the standards in the homes are really not up to minimum acceptable standards the majority have many many problems theres no professional people working in these centers the physical organization the fact that the children cannot leave the home they cannot freely move
9374033 the centers have the full control of the system the centers are the one who decide who are the abandoned who should leave for adoption for inter country adoption so where they make their money is through inter country adoption because parents in the outside are so eager to have children so people are ready to pay any amount an adoption law should absolutely stop this business
9374034 once they have seen the child most families they are hooked and the home has power over these parents because they want to have this child they can ask for more money how much is demanded is difficult to say 20 25 30 000
9374035 but nobody will really say how much it pays because they know its not really ethically correct
9374036 no im not surprised actually the contents of the report are not that surprising of course the report has revealed many things that need immediate improvement
9374037 it will help us reform the inter country adoption process and there to make good provisions regarding the rights of the child
9374038 tujuan tersebut tercapai dengan menghayati arti puasa itu sendiri memahami dan menghayati arti puasa memerlukan pemahaman terhadap dua hal pokok menyangkut hakikat manusia dan kewajibanya di bumi ini
9374039 dalam kitab perjanjian lama demikian pula dalam kitab kitab hadits ditemukan bahwa tuhan menciptakan manusia menurut petanya dalam arti diberi potensi untuk memiliki sifat sifat tuhan sesuai dengan kemampuannya sebagai makhluk
9374040 pengalaman tersebut antara lain adalah persentuhannya dengan keadaan di surga itu sendiri
9374041 hakikat keberagamaan adalah upaya untuk mendekati allah sehingga kita menemukan puasa terdapat pada seluruh agama di dunia ini

9374043 how long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled the vision concerning the daily sacrifice the rebellion that causes desolation and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot
9374044 it will take 2 300 evenings and mornings then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated
9374045 understand that the vision concerns the time of the end
9374046 i am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end

9374082 there is really no unity within the e u about how to deal with russia when you have unity it is because russia has behaved so badly it generally has a unifying effect on the e u but the problem is that when push comes to shove when it comes to hard concrete decisions the e u tends to fall apart when it deals with russia
9374083 what the europeans have to emphasize is that if russia continues the way it is doing it will be increasingly isolated and vulnerable however if russia shows a bit of give then the e u if very very interested in pursuing and developing constructive engagement with russia i think that should be the message it cannot be all stick there has to be some carrot

9374206 we are deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents of the gulf state region our top priority is to assist those who will be affected by hurricane gustav this is not a time for politics or celebration it is a time for us to come together as americans and assist the residents of the gulf states
9374207 in order for the republican party to officially exist and for senator mccain to qualify for the ballot we are by law required to conduct specific official business at this point our program on monday has been scaled back and will only include what party rules governing the nomination of our candidates for president and vice president require we will perform the official business as required in addition we have set aside time to make delegates and americans watching our proceedings at home aware of what they can do to assist in relief efforts designed to help those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9374208 at some point between monday and thursday evening we will convene once again to complete the activities needed to qualify senator mccain and governor palin for the ballot in all 50 states beyond that all we can say is that we will monitor what is happening and make decisions about other convention business as details become available
9374209 the safety and well being of the people of the gulf states remains our top concern we are doing everything we can on the ground in minneapolis saint paul to ensure that the delegations affected by this storm have the resources and information that they need as senator mccain said this morning we must redirect our attention and efforts we will act as americans not republicans to help our fellow citizens in need
9374210 we appreciate the thoughts and prayers of everyone around the country as we prepare for this dangerous storm we are here in minnesota for the necessary job of nominating our choice for president and vice president but obviously our focus is on our families and friends back at home we are in constant communication with our governors and elected officials and feel confident that they are taking the appropriate and necessary steps to prepare the purpose of this group is to discuss ways that we can come together to provide information and support for our delegates here in minneapolis
9374211 as we all watch and prepare for gustav to make landfall it is important that the convention make it as easy as possible for delegates to be where they are needed most with their families and local agencies in their home states we are grateful to senator mccain for making this resource available to the delegates from the gulf states

9374317 we will be looking at the banking records we obtain cheques bank statements deposit slips electronic statements for each step in the chain
9374318 as well as looking at the money trail we look at the receipts and the movements of money and how its ultimate use was accounted for
9374319 we look at ledgers spreadsheets books of accounts we turn over the rocks we believe are relevant and see whats under them
9374320 i find the national partys statement and timing interesting because i would say its almost certain they got a tip from the serious fraud office that it was about to move
9374321 i challenge them directly to come clean because i think its a very serious thing if an agency like the sfo is leaking to the opposition

9374328 me parece irracional que porque les pedimos una cuota de solidaridad que muchos m dicos han aceptado de muy buena gana y con mucho entusiasmo se vayan a un paro nacional
9374329 pedir de inmediato 10 de aumento y que se les pague los cuatro sueldos que ganan los se ores de essalud que representar a invertir m s dinero de lo que se ha dado para la reconstrucci n de pisco 1 293 millones de soles es algo exagerado
9374330 it feels like a new beginning but i am not going to lie and say i dont have urges
9374331 it took about six months to a year to get hooked unbelievably fast
9374332 they give you the information to help you but it is up to you to make the change but i know i wont be over this addiction until i have left this mortal coil because every day there is an opportunity to gamble
9374333 even someones mobile telephone ring tone can remind me of the machines
9374334 i could be sitting next to someone for hours but the only thing they would say is hey could you watch my machine
9374335 i never did anything i won i put it straight back in the machine
9374336 it makes it that much harder one lady laughed at me for wanting to self bar myself
9374337 as an athlete i have seen my harrier club benefit from receiving pokie money but that pales in comparison to what i and others have lost as far as i am concerned it is blood money

9374342 these guys the truck drivers are great they enjoy spending time with the kids and hanging with them friendships are forged and everywhere you look around all day kids are smiling its just a big party
9374343 we came for the first time last year and i think well be coming for the rest of our lives now
9374344 its actually humbling that they put on a day like this for kids with special needs its just awesome
9374345 the bus driver provided a couple of warnings before asking the youths to get off while one of the youths was leaving the bus she punched the driver in the face seconds later she re entered and punched the driver two more times she and four other youths fled the scene on foot
9374346 the female youth is in custody awaiting charges of assault one other youth is facing an obstruction charge while the others were released with no charges
9374347 therefore the committee felt because they were contentious and bringing division to the community they should be excluded from the discussion
9374348 you could not have glenrosa you could not have shannon lake or lakeview heights what im saying is that could also exclude gellatly or boucherie or green bay
9374349 it will create a different kind of division with people feeling disenfranchised especially after we have closed the process and submitted all of these names its going to create more concern in my opinion with people asking why the process was run this way to begin with
9374350 the addition of two new lanes to this section of highway 97a will reduce delays and improve travel time through this busy area
9374351 having new roundabouts will eliminate direct access off the highway improving the safety of drivers travelling along this route it is through collaborative infrastructure projects like these that we can continue to meet the needs of both residents and travellers through the area
9374352 our nine volunteer walk organizers around the province are working very hard to surpass last years outstanding success
9374353 we raised 225 000 in 2007 which was the most ever raised since the start of superwalk in bc 13 years ago and we are determined to exceed that number in september

9374413 of course theres no hiding that much public service is depressingly bad but again this has nothing to do with public or private customer service in the private sector is equally poor this is not surprising because ironically the badness in both cases could be said to be another market externality the purchase of identical it based mass production service systems geared to meeting the internal incentives of the management consultancies that sell them rather than the needs of the end customer intrinsically there is no reason why public sector organisations cannot provide service at least as good as the best private sector outfits and a growing number of them do

9374478 with the public notification we will empower principals of schools colleges station masters postman airport authorities to challan book those smoking in public places once caught the smoker will have to pay rs 200 or whatever he has if he is carrying less than that amount
9374479 these people have better access to public places and their involvement will work as community participation to reduce smoking in the country
9374480 the public notification will empower top officials in private firms to challan their employees the challan money will go to the revenue department of the state government concerned

9374562 not all women are like that but many women just fall into the routine of not making love and begin to focus on other things like kids cooking etc
9374563 i mean gloria how do you and your husband keep things going dont you get bored
9374564 he just doesnt seem interested and i dont become very interested either because he doesnt spend enough time with me before the magic moment his magic moment
9374565 its too bad society pigeon holes us into the roles of husband wife family and all that when sometimes it just gets in the way with what many people need
9374566 sometimes i think it would be better to have all that and a lover on the side
9374567 you are a very attractive woman and its a shame that you dont get all the lovin that you want and need and the kind of lovemaking that puts you first if you know what i mean

9374584 the passport gave him reason to suspect u s military involvement in the russia georgia conflict over south ossetia
9374585 he will probably be out for ten days to two weeks
9374586 it is the same injury that he got against wolves
9374587 we never put any blame on berbatov for the last two results
9374588 he wasnt there on the park so it was those on the park it was those on the pitch that were to blame and it was the same players that are responsible for putting in that great performance today sunday and getting a fantastic result
9374589 but i always bring this and nobody ever stops me
9374590 its often been said that empty vessels make most noise and the people who have been involved and the people who have done anything themselves wouldnt be out there criticising anybody
9374591 they would understand what is required to perform at a high level and its very satisfying that the players and the people who know best ere happy with the level of effort and commitment that were being put into our progress
9374592 youll always have people like that theyll come out of the woodwork time and time again but thats life and youll always meet people like that but there are many more people who appreciate what we do the rest of the time
9374593 that there is still belief there even with matty forde not on the field they drove really really hard it wasnt mentioned
9374594 id be surprised if we sign another player the club we have been speaking to have moved the goalposts so we have backed out of the deal
9374595 i wouldnt expect too much more action at our place
9374596 you lose games if two or three underperform never mind all of them
9374597 every manager wants a positive result before an international break because if not its a long two weeks
9374598 maybe its a good thing because i will be glad to see the back of one or two of them
9374599 i have my laptop down there and i kept looking at the weather radar
9374600 i knew it was going to be a while ive become a pretty good weatherman after 32 years of coaching
9374601 je mengage ce que demain lundi soir et si n cessaire durant notre convention nous nous comportions en am ricains et non comme des militants r publicains parce que lam rique a besoin de nous
9374602 il ne serait absolument pas appropri davoir une occasion de f te alors quune trag die approche sous la forme dune catastrophe naturelle
9374603 they went down fighting it was a simple case that they played for one half you are not going to win a game of that significance we didnt play to a good enough standard in the first half
9374604 but you look at whether it is team selection tactics effort the opposition were very good what you want to put your finger on there are a lot of different factors that contributed to that but certainly the intensity that we began in the first half or played nearly the entire first half was like the intensity that we played the entire second half against dublin if you give the opposition time on the ball they are going to cause havoc we did that
9374605 to a certain extent you can put some of it down to experience it didnt feel like the players were very nervous but its the biggest stage they have played at
9374606 the players there the most important games they would have played you are looking at some of them playing county finals some of them played in schools finals division three national three final and one leinster final so there is a severe lack of experience
9374607 so they will have learned an awful lot from that from a management perspective we would be hoping that this will make them hungry very very hungry for something more in the future
9374608 im optimistic above all because of the game that ronaldinho had
9374609 it was a strange game one of those surprises that can happen at the beginning of the season we played a good game we attacked for 90 minutes and there were two instances when bologna was better than us
9374610 it was an open game that could have gone either way
9374611 i have kalou if you ask arsene wenger he wants kalou as a centre forward and arsene is an intelligent man
9374612 he wanted kalou two or three months ago when we started negotiations for some players i said no
9374613 for me we played well i think we need to respect
9374614 it was an interesting derby and a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9374615 they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create

9374633 after 8 years of george bush the constitution itself has been shredded
9374634 is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human cancer tumours but inactive in most normal cells
9374635 that means that a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9374636 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9374637 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes in initiate telomere replication
9374638 there is no doubt that having determined the structure of telomerase is extremely important in understanding cancer biology and will probably help lead us in the development of telomerase inhibitors
9374639 but whether these inhibitors will ultimately represent an effective class of anti cancer treatments it is too early to say
9374640 in a therapeutic setting although an exciting prospect will require a great deal more research
9374641 i sincerely hope the next us administration will demonstrate a greater leadership role
9374642 climate change is no longer just a phenomenon it has developed into a full scale crisis which threatens broad areas of human endeavour such as the race to reach and maintain the uns millennium development goals
9374643 will continue to look to the ipcc for guidance on the science and policy prescriptions needed to effectively address the obstacles ahead
9374644 it is crucial that this new agreement measures up to your panels scientific findings
9374645 that is why i look to you to constantly make the scientific case for action on the road to copenhagen and indeed beyond
9374646 i sincerely hope the next us administration will demonstrate a greater leadership role
9374647 we needed something to kickstart the season to lift the season and give the players some confidence
9374648 we need to respect tottenham they are a very good team and play very well and sometimes makes it impossible to win
9374649 we had more chances but we made mistakes with the final shots they put five six seven eight nine players in the back and its difficult to create
9374650 in the first half maybe we were paying a little bit too much respect to our opponents maybe even overawed by chelsea and the stadium
9374651 but by the second half that was a thing of the past our performance in the second half pretty much deserved the point
9374652 this is why we made more mistakes we need to try to work more with the ball
9374653 we have a team whose game is based on movement and passing it is linked with the quality of how much we integrate our philosophy of the game and how much we want to push our talent
9374654 there was a little bit of frustration from the fans because they thought that he didnt always have enough end product but he has improved a lot in that respect with his final balls since the start of the season
9374655 we like him to have the ball because we know every time he does he will do something with it
9374656 when he gets the ball you are happy thats the sign of a good player you do not have to worry about the rest
9374657 we do not want players doing that retaliation even if you are provoked you have to control yourself
9374658 i dont know if its linked with that it can always be an explanation but not an excuse
9374659 i am very happy and learned nearly everything i know here
9374660 an estimated 15 million american children are diagnosed with a mental disorder but only about a quarter of them are getting appropriate treatment based on scientific evidence

9374663 choosing the right treatment what families need to know about evidence based practices
9374664 although children and adolescents comprise 25 of the us population only one ninth of health care funding is directed to them
9374665 je suis ravi de vous annoncer que votre tableau jambes de damoiselles a
9374666 we are taking this seriously there have been a string of calls about sightings
9374667 police in north belfast are warning the public to be aware of sightings of what appears to be a lion in the upper hightown end of cavehill park
9374668 police are currently responding to the incident and would urge the public to avoid the area
9374669 anyone who thinks they may have seen the animal should not attempt to approach it
9374670 of course this is a time when we have to do away with most of our party politics
9374671 were going to suspend most of our activities except those that are absolutely necessary
9374672 i hope and pray we will be able to resume some of our normal operations as quickly as possible
9374673 obviously this is a great disappointment for the republicans who have spent a lot of money and time planning this
9374674 je ne mint resse pas seulement la mise en place dinstances citoyennes au niveau national mais ce quexistent aussi des instances de vigilance et des exigences citoyennes dans chaque etat et dans les plus grandes villes qui puissent servir d noncer et promouvoir une culture de participation et de d nonciation
9374675 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot scolari said
9374676 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9374677 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9374678 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium
9374679 in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got
9374680 i heard from a friend about a program called teacher next door and decided to look into it
9374681 its similar in concept to some apartment developments that give discounts to police because they want to encourage them to live and be seen in the community
9374682 these homes are in neighborhoods that have some combination of vacancies or low owner occupancy rates they essentially need a boost
9374683 its been cheaper to buy a home than rent an apartment
9374684 its an incentive to live in the city i can see myself staying long term
9374685 i was talking about buying a new car and he said you already have a car
9374686 there were two big holes one in the basement and the other in the living room ceiling
9374687 the recalculation probably worked in our favour but we batted really well but i asked the boys to do a job and they have done it today winning becomes a habit and when you start winning game after game after game you learn how to win
9374688 andrew is playing some of the best cricket of his career
9374689 i know owais would come good he proved what a good player he is he delivered today and played some fantastic shots
9374690 the dressing room is down we pride ourselves on our results but there are some positives to take out today we are learning from our mistakes and we have some young players learning about international cricket
9374691 flintoff has been unbelievable he has proved he is a good player and he adds balance to the england side he is a world class performer

9374696 in the first set she played quite solid i was the one who was all over the place i couldnt find my rhythm in these conditions and she took advantage of that jankovic said
9374697 i stayed calm and composed and knew i had to do something to change that in the second set i did the smart things and i cruised through the second and third set
9374698 by winning a grand slam i would regain the no 1 ranking its something i want to achieve again
9374699 i have been injured right now i finally do not have any problems jankovic said
9374700 little by little i feel like im getting better every day i feel the shots a lot better than i did at the beginning of the tournament thats my goal get my game together by the end of the tournament
9374701 the second set i got a bit more defensive even though i was hitting the ball it wasnt going well she kept coming in and forcing play she was just better than me
9374702 im getting better each day im improving on my fitness jankovic said
9374703 i can push off better little by little im putting the pieces together im bringing my game to the next level i believe in myself
9374704 stalin did not know who would deal the next blow and for that reason he attacked every known group and movement as well as those who were not his allies or of his mindset
9374705 we are just exploring his personality explaining his motives and showing what he really achieved
9374706 stalin by no means acted rationally all of the time and many of his actions damaged the country
9374707 many in the military ranks were arrested like my father for example and their children little boys were sent to the front
9374708 i have no personal affection for him but i am a historian and i work with facts
9374709 can you tell me of any other leader an american president for example who read 10 000 books
9374710 demand the whole of society have its say about the most painful pages of our history
9374711 others cannot be allowed to impose a feeling of guilt on us
9374712 the people of jammu and kashmir will live together in happiness
9374713 and stay on the job until you succeed no matter how much time is required
9374714 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9374715 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9374716 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9374717 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9374718 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9374719 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9374720 e tutto quello che devi fare metterti le cuffie traccia dopo traccia nessuna andata persa tutte sono state vissute e tutte servono ad andare avanti
9374721 i sincerely hope the next us administration will demonstrate a greater leadership role

9374746 our forces are ready to take the security responsibility tomorrow monday
9374747 they are controlling the situation our troops are on alert to avert any failure of the transfer
9374748 we are happy that iraqi forces will be in control now of the security rather than the foreign troops that is how it should be iraqis should protect the iraqis
9374749 our forces are not ready to take responsibility for the situation i am sorry to say but there is lot of corruption in our security forces
9374750 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9374751 het heft van de staatshervorming zelf in handen te nemen
9374752 uiteraard is dit een ogenblik om onze partijpolitiek aan de kant te zetten we gaan de meeste activiteiten schrappen behalve diegene die echt nodig zijn
9374753 so i thought id tell her a little joke this morning
9374754 in the first half i thought we were their best player and gave them two goals we showed some fight coming back from down 4 1 but in the end we lost the game
9374755 het heft van de staatshervorming zelf in handen te nemen
9374756 niets te maken heeft met de mening van bart de wever
9374757 op te houden met dag na dag te vechten met ultimatums over institutionele onderwerpen en zich te concentreren op de socio economische uitdagingen
9374758 de tijd te nemen om de mensen rond de tafel te plaatsen en voor te bereiden op wat er zal gebeuren na de regionale verkiezingen van 2009
9374759 theres very little doubt we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster
9374760 i will not be going to minnesota for the republican national convention
9374761 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9374762 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9374763 and i think for john mccain to want to find out whats going on is fine
9374764 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9374765 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue
9374766 were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9374767 seemed confident about having positioned for example buses on the ground ahead of time as opposed to waiting after the storm to try to get buses in
9374768 there appears to be better coordination between the state and the city in louisiana i havent spoken to folks in mississippi or alabama it appears there is coordination between the four states that there wasnt last time
9374769 i sincerely hope the next us administration will demonstrate a greater leadership role
9374770 climate change is no longer just a phenomenon it has developed into a full scale crisis which threatens broad areas of human endeavour such as the race to reach and maintain the uns millennium development goals
9374771 will continue to look to the ipcc for guidance on the science and policy prescriptions needed to effectively address the obstacles ahead
9374772 it is crucial that this new agreement measures up to your panels scientific findings
9374773 that is why i look to you to constantly make the scientific case for action on the road to copenhagen and indeed beyond
9374774 i sincerely hope the next us administration will demonstrate a greater leadership role
9374775 the devil came through here it swept it completely said juan carlos rodriguez who works for the municipal school management office and spent the night guarding the building
9374776 this is very sad its unbearable to watch a woman said as she burst into tears and walked away without giving her name
9374777 things that seemed safe are damaged ana isa delgado president of the municipal civil defense committee was quoted saying in sundays state media
9374778 cars in parking lots went flying others are twisted rooftop water tanks window and doors have been ripped out avenues are unpassable
9374779 it will take us at least six months to get back to a basic level of infrastructure
9374780 i stayed in my closet with my two children and prayed the whole time said mabel ayerbe a 36 year old housewife
9374781 the little one was crying and the older one wanted to see the wind the first pass took about two hours then we were in the eye for some 45 minutes and the weather was totally clear after the eye it lost some strength but the first pass was violent
9374782 it showed people the basic level of managerial incompetence in the administration
9374783 do not expect this speech to define the presidents legacy this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments of the past seven and one half years it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it will certainly not attack barack obama
9374784 have to look forward and talk about passing the torch they cant talk about iraq or the economy in fact i cant think of any policy they could dwell on
9374785 hes still very popular with republicans if he delivers the right message and doesnt pick too many fights over policies he can help the party
9374786 they should concentrate on trying to show republicans want to help
9374787 if they miss a day of convention speeches its not the end of the world
9374788 george played a major role in everything we accomplished in these eight years
9374789 the george bush ive seen up close when the staff and cabinet members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone someone whos not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue
9374790 an uninhabited part of alaska is near an also uninhabited part of alaska
9374791 the distribution of federal taxing and spending is mostly driven by tax burdens not the ability of lawmakers to divert spending to their home states
9374792 it is too early to confirm whether the aircraft crashed into a mountain or if there are any survivors
9374793 the deal will secure many attractive jobs for the long term even though unfortunately we cannot keep all current positions
9374794 we are looking for amicable solutions and will closely involve employee representatives in all of the necessary measures this is part of our corporate culture

9374806 is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human cancer tumours but inactive in most normal cells
9374807 that means that a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9374808 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9374809 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes in initiate telomere replication
9374810 there is no doubt that having determined the structure of telomerase is extremely important in understanding cancer biology and will probably help lead us in the development of telomerase inhibitors
9374811 but whether these inhibitors will ultimately represent an effective class of anti cancer treatments it is too early to say
9374812 in a therapeutic setting although an exciting prospect will require a great deal more research

9374833 in the army any sign that you are a woman means you are automatically ridiculed and treated as inferior
9374834 there are only three things the guys let you be if youre a girl in the military a bitch a ho or a dyke i know which one i am hint we get things done one guy told me he thinks the military sends women over to give the guys eye candy to keep them sane he told me in vietnam they had prostitutes but they dont have those in iraq so they have women soldiers instead
9374835 but youre quite wrong i knew mr kafka in prague and he was never late
9374836 our game against texas tech on friday wasnt a confidence builder but i think the game today is really the start of our season we got good chances and scoring four goals really gets us going for the rest of the year
9374837 we have opened each of our first four games strong but we werent scoring like we did today
9374838 the kids played well today and we finished on our opportunities to score and thats a good thing
9374839 these decisions were not wanted by the department of natural resource and they were not wanted by the governors office
9374840 but with a budget that is not balanced and being 2 1 billion underfunded they had to be made
9374841 these are the consequences of a struggling economy and underfunded budget
9374842 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9374843 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9374844 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
9374845 were going to invest 15 billion a year in making highly efficient cars of the future right here in ohio right here in america

9374848 unless our administration team and johns have a fight in the car park hes a city player now
9374849 everyone is talking about the money invested in the club but theyve gone about things in a normal way and havent gone crazy with the money its more about using the players here and improving
9374850 its evolution rather than revolution the bosses here are very wealthy people and want success i want to embrace that what weve given them is a committed disciplined and courageous performance
9374851 ugo looked back to his very best and were talking about a lad who has played at the very highest level blackwell said
9374852 it confirmed everything that people had told me about it
9374853 after the disappointment in europe we needed to start the campaign strongly and it is important for us to be top of the league we will now do everything we can to stay there the atmosphere at the club is different because everyone is happy
9374854 you hear so many different things for three months you hear that this club might be signing you or this one its wrecking ill be glad when its over
9374855 i dont know how close i came to leaving youll have to ask the club they obviously felt the offers werent right and i have two years left on my contract so theres not much i can do about it
9374856 i dont know about this hat trick adding money to my value but ive certainly got my reputation back because the last five or six months havent been great
9374857 will i stay at reading i dont know yeah i presume so because theres not long to go until the transfer window closes
9374858 its difficult to predict but stranger things have happened i suppose
9374859 its my first professional hat trick so its a great feeling
9374860 when i had one cleared off the line a header hit the post and a volley saved by the keeper i thought it was going to be one of those days
9374861 after christmas i think me dave kitson leroy lita and shane long probably got three goals between us it wasnt just me but i think it got highlighted that it was me hopefully we can play like we used to do here more often we were open and free flowing and everyone looked like they could score it was the same form we showed when we finished eighth in the premier league and won the championship
9374862 our defenders have been brilliant for us all season but we have to get back on the training field and make sure it doesnt happen again
9374863 we have quality players were definitely aiming for the play offs
9374864 we want to show teams in the league were not just here to make up the numbers we want to push for the play offs if not go for automatic promotion
9374865 the boss asked if theres any chance of me getting in the box to score in future i said ill just save my energy by shooting outside the area it seems to work
9374866 i thought it was really harsh to be a goal down given the way that we had started
9374867 we didnt panic and the lads were excellent after that
9374868 i would have put my house on that one and duly lost it but kevin has proved he is human
9374869 we stopped giving ipswich presents and the result was deserved
9374870 the gaffer mick mccarthy told me id got five minutes after i was caught by that tackle i said i wanted to stay on and try and get my hat trick
9374871 so he said youve got one more chance i whipped it over the bar and he said thats your chance now off you come it would have been nice to get a hat trick but ill take the two goals
9374872 we are as good as anyone in this league when we perform like this we are near enough unplayable but its doing it week in week out thats our aim we think we can play even better because we are still young and learning
9374873 when i signed matt the thought of playing him and michael in the same team excited me it didnt happen often enough last season but when it did towards the end we finished with real momentum now they are both out there and our fans are being excited
9374874 we started well but gave away a cheap goal and after that we just couldnt compete
9374875 his co dependent relationship with his mother a relationship that prompted him to live at home at an age when his friends were marrying and raising families reinforced the self destructive feelings that surfaced whenever her health deteriorated
9374876 how can you kill a thing that is already dead
9374877 leaving one as dry as the withered tongue of a stygian mummy
9374878 it does a man good once in a while to be virtuous even a cimmerian
9374879 on the other hand he secretly envied the khitan his exquisitely cultivated manners and easy charm this fact led conan to resent the duke even more for although his turanian service had given conan some slight polish he was still at heart the blunt boorish young barbarian
9374880 they have been cromping for two weeks making violent passionate love every night etc she must smell delicious narcotic pooh of the odd tree never mind if waxen pale blossoms are slowly sinking to press kisses against her flushing crimson as they drink her warm blood conan comes completely awake all at once as barbarians do his nice blond nookie is gone in embrace of eerie smelly tree goddam vampire tree sets fire to jungle underbrush to kill perfume
9374881 but with a high heart turning to the golden south where shining cities lifted tall towers to a balmy sun and where a stong man with courage and luck could win gold wine and soft full breasted women
9374882 i never saw anything but i will take a look at it if it is an act of petulance he will be punished for that in no uncertain terms we will not stand for that
9374883 he is a quality player but now he will be missing a few games you cant get frustrated and you try to get that across to young players but they must learn that quickly
9374884 we are a team finding our feet at the moment
9374885 we controlled the whole game swansea manager roberto martinez lamented afterwards
9374886 we deserved a victory and the players are all feeling very disappointed
9374887 considering both are young in their mid late twenties and have not secured jobs elsewhere it is an odd and very perplexing situation
9374888 sounds to me like congratulations are in order alex elliots last blog post up a hill

9374893 shaquille titi and a young neighbour an older boy were all sat on their doorstep when the gang of youths came past the older boy managed to run away but the gang got shaquille he didnt think hed even been stabbed at first

9374895 the economic and fiscal forecasts will be updated in the usual way in the pre budget report
9374896 i think its absolutely right that the prime minister alistair the rest of us have in alistairs words been levelling with people nothing irritates people more than if they think theyre being led a dance told a story
9374897 the message from from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same
9374898 jack straws attempts to portray a united front do nothing to hide the deep rifts exposed this weekend at the very top of this dysfunctional government alistair darlings outburst of truth about the economy has torpedoed the prime ministers much trailed recovery plan before it is even launched
9374899 government ministers have been told to say that alistair darling was levelling with people when he said the economy is at a sixty year low and getting worse

9374902 the emerging rivalry between cameron and boris will mark the next period of our politics as deeply as the blair brown rivalry marked labours years of prosperity

9374906 geology is the study of pressure and time thats all it takes really pressure and time
9374907 palin has more executive level decision making and governing experience in two years than obama and biden do combined
9374908 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
9374909 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
9374910 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
9374911 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives
9374912 when i first came across these islands in 2004 i discovered a simple but beautiful place it was a private island back then owned by an indonesian family and looked after by a german friend of mine and his family who had lived in indonesia for many years i fell in love with the islands and was invited to help look after them eventually my friend moved away and his parents retired in bali and the owners invited me to look after the place full time it was then that i decided to evolve the islands into a small scale eco resort and apply the concept of an eco village thankfully the island owners and caretakers support this vision fully and together we have committed ourselves to realize this dream late in 2007 i took over management of two gorgeous islands off the north coast of java and began work on creating the first model of an eco resort village
9374913 its not uncommon for trains to run out of fuel here

9374915 in scotland it is a popular belief that a few hairs of the dog that bit you applied to the wound will prevent evil consequences
9374916 the police just stopped the car on its tracks and have them trapped in there
9374917 theyre reporters trying to defend democracy this has to stop
9374918 the conventional wisdom is that with a new cold war looming and global conflicts upon us barack obama needed a vice president with foreign policy experience most establishment pundits buy the view that joe biden provides it
9374919 anybody whos caught looting in the city of new orleans will go directly to angola louisiana state penitentiary you will not have a temporary stay in the city you go directly to the big house in general population
9374920 people say we want to play a peter de villiers style of rugby what the devil is that let me explain it to you
9374921 there was a time when we were isolated due to apartheid but when we came back what we didnt do was look at where we were strong instead we copied the model of the australians and became more structured we thought that was the only model available
9374922 we just need to add a component to our game we need players making decisions and playing the situation
9374923 its been very difficult to implement this way of thinking
9374924 but whatever decision they make i will support the players even though i wont always agree with that decision
9374925 we didnt say we will win or lose we have no control over whether we win or lose but we dont work to lose
9374926 what a refreshing change from the same ole same ole we have seen in recent months and weeks
9374927 the weak closing in the us markets on friday and volatility in the crude prices may affect the sentiments of the investors in the coming week
9374928 we think that inflation and oil will remain a big concern for the markets in the coming weeks there are strong chances that inflation may increase in the coming weeks which might impact the markets negatively
9374929 we may see some liquidity in the market after the launch of currency futures in the nse last week i think that volumes will also increase in the coming days as more investors and institutional players will invest in currency futures apart from this there are no major triggers which may impact the markets
9374930 prices will remain susceptible to the movement in the dollar if us economic data shows better than expected results then the dollar may strengthen against major currencies and cap the upside in precious metals
9374931 change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time we are the ones weve been waiting for we are the change that we seek
9374932 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america
9374933 focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
9374934 fifteen percent looks small but the impact is larger than meets the eye
9374935 louisiana refineries supply a chunk of the southern states product needs gasoline diesel whatever
9374936 that could keep a lot of those refineries shut down for awhile because you have to deal with flooding and power outages
9374937 if that capacity remains shut down for an extended amount of time you could see prices really start to rise four dollar gasoline is not out of the question
9374938 i think the morale in the team might be a bit lower for picking poulter ahead of darren clarke
9374939 i felt there was a dead certainty for it to be darren clarke and paul casey
9374940 im surprised ian poulter didnt come back and fight for his place
9374941 there will be a few players today thinking nick i think youve made a mistake
9374942 i dont think ian poulter will let the team down but he poulter didnt turn up to the last event and darrens the form guy ian poulter has missed the last two cuts
9374943 darren clarke has won two tournaments on the european tour this year he won a tournament two weeks ago in a very strong field on a tough course
9374944 hes got a great ryder cup record in the past hes played well with lee westwood and sergio garcia
9374945 i dont want to pull the team down nicks his own man i just had a sneaking feeling at the back of my mind that nick faldo would do something different
9374946 he faldo is slightly controversial and hes lived up to it
9374947 ever wonder why people believe in ufo abductions mind reading reincarnation urban legends not to mention
9374948 in what is sure to be an entertaining frightening and thought provoking discussion a diverse amount of panelists will dive in to the age old question what makes us fear the unknown
9374949 is he really going to give us an 300 tax cut
9374950 joe smith wants your grandma to die alone and in pain
9374951 youre probably too young to remember jim jones and jonestown
9374952 make certain that headlines news teases and promotional material photos video audio graphics sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent they should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context
9374953 launching a real estate mutual fund is a slightly lengthy process and a fund house that intends to launch a remf needs professional and experienced people to handle this fund i think it will take other four six months for the first remf to be launched in india
9374954 the issue of valuations of the assets is also a big concern for the fund houses
9374955 effective valuation for each underlying property has to be extremely clear we also have intentions of launching a fund and are preparing and will be able to launch a remf only after a couple of months
9374956 sebi has directed that each real estate property in a fund has to be valued every three months which will be hard to execute and will add to fund costs apart from that valuation of property by two different valuers may not be according to a set standard and may vary significantly sebi is also aware of these problems and we think that valuations problem will be further simplified in due course
9374957 no clinical trials player in india does any unethical work or else well be out of business the overwhelming majority of trials are conducted in a legal framework
9374958 while the issue of illegal clinical trials is definitely an area of concern many of the incidents reported indicate ignorance rather than deliberate malafide intensions
9374959 clinical trials are often the only means of hope for patients with several life threatening diseases that have no known definitive cure
9374960 increasing globalisation has brought about fundamental changes in the way clinical trials are conducted here
9374961 we have to be prepared to give quality leadership and come up to global standards in the clinical trials space
9374962 this can happen when we have good infrastructure like world class laboratories for doing safety testing to find out for any toxicity in the drugs under development
9374963 india does not participate in phase i trials the most risky of all trials the overwhelming majority of trials conducted in india are phase ii and iii by this time the drug has already been tested in humans abroad and has been found to be safe
9374964 all the data generated in india must meet usfda requirements or those of drug regulators from other countries
9374965 globally clinical trials are a necessity for the ultimate benefit of mankind how can one have better drugs with no prior trials
9374966 we should remember that almost all allopathic drugs used in india are of foreign origin there is hardly any original drug worth mentioning that has been developed by an indian pharma company hence there is no reason to feel threatened if any foreign company drugs are being used in clinical trials in india
9374967 oil is indias biggest concern and hence with the softening of prices the market was bound to react
9374968 oil and the commodity complex in general have commenced a medium term correction which will last for several quarters and not just weeks this would be a major positive for india from a relative return perspective in the context of dedicated asian and global emerging market portfolios
9374969 while the present weather is overcast and cold the spring may not be far behind growth though slowing is certainly not collapsing there is no structural breakdown in the economy a significant correction in commodity prices has eased the concern inflation expectations seem to be peaking off the industrial credit growth is still robust despite positive real rates global growth is also not yet dead valuations are not be compelling but far from expensive territory
9374970 portfolio managers and select investors are betting on the return of overseas investors and are building up positions
9374971 sped up the inevitable proliferation of advanced technology by forcing other countries to find other means of obtaining satellite components that had previously been manufactured only in the united states
9374972 if the purpose of itar is to lose billions of dollars of business ship jobs overseas and the iranians and the chinese get the same technology anyway then mission accomplished
9374973 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9374974 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9374975 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9374976 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9374977 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9374978 i thin sen obama if they want to do down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does
9374979 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded
9374980 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9374981 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9374982 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9374983 beverage alcohol really is only mildly affected by the economic factors
9374984 a lot of consumers would still consider alcoholic beverages as an affordable indulgence
9374985 its essentially a portfolio the industry presents to the customer so that if theres a problem in income you can still drink and they can still sell
9374986 people are very rational over all theyre doing what makes sense they still want to sit down after work and have a beer and ok it wont be a heineken theyll have a budweiser
9374987 a lot of people think that when times are bad people will drink more the evidence is pretty clear that at least in terms of alcohol sales that thats not true that people will drink less
9374988 someone might cut back on the expensive bottle of wine but spend that same amount of money on quite a bit of high alcohol whiskey or liquor and they could engage in much more serious binge drinking
9374989 all the scotches are sitting still the budweiser on tap is a good mover thats about it
9374990 i went some place last night and i said are you kidding me 8 for a beer
9374991 the word of god is quick and powerful sharper than any two edged sword
9374992 it cannot be ignored that the principal qualities she will bring to the republican campaign are enhanced by her being a young woman of conviction she is the very antithesis of the old man of relativity joe biden
9374993 its okay honey you can get the appetizer its on me
9374994 unfit for command swift boat veterans speak out against john kerry
9374995 there is no place like this in europe for us
9374996 i love pismo i love the atmosphere and people are generally nice

9374999 i think for some voters without a doubt that would play a role in their decisions
9375000 the level of taxes in california is definitely something most taxpayers are concerned about
9375001 but i think people have the ability to differentiate between whats happening at the state level and whats occurring locally
9375002 im hoping voters will be able to discern that measure a money is locally controlled and desperately needed
9375003 whereas the state tax increase is going to disappear in a black hole i hope theyll be able to see that measure a is something we need and another state tax is the last thing we need that not all taxes are created equal
9375004 whether that would erode support for measure a remains to be seen there is the issue of voter tax fatigue to consider
9375005 some key differences between measure a and a state sales tax
9375006 the dollars raised by measure a are going to stay in our community
9375007 theyre not money going into a black hole in sacramento to cover the budget deficit
9375008 i think we just have to be clear that measure a is a continuation of a tax they have been paying for almost 20 years
9375009 we believe voters will understand the difference between a tax increase
9375010 voters want measure a as a reliable source of money for their roads and its not an increase in taxes
9375011 its got a real santa ynez valley feel to it
9375012 i think theyre perfect for this setting its a real comfortable atmosphere
9375013 i like this because its a lot of the smaller guys like me who sell a lot locally
9375014 when they raise money they do good things with it
9375015 if the board approves the concept it would direct the staff to negotiate a contract
9375016 they didnt say they would fund it but they supported the concept
9375017 it would be similar to other performance items in the contract
9375018 if the coalition is not performing in its funding requirement the contract is subject to being canceled
9375019 part of that would include how theyre doing in terms of fundraising

9375021 for ebay buyers we recommend the following steps to help ensure a successful trading experience
9375022 we need to get californians beyond being stuck in our cars sitting in traffic
9375023 sb 375 will help get us moving again and cut global warming pollution at the same time we look forward to working with the broad coalition that came together to support this bill to make sure it is implemented effectively
9375024 sb 375 is not just another example of californias national environmental leadership
9375025 that the cradle of car culture is the first to tackle the global warming problem of long commutes is a watershed moment
9375026 we wanted the junkets at the roosevelt because of its ghostly reputation but we got so much more than we bargained for a photoshoot we prepared was wrecked and two runners say they saw the figure of a lady in the full length mirror the final straw came when a production assistant stayed in the room earmarked for ricky and claimed to have been freezing cold on the hottest day of the year he said he woke up with someone whistling in his ear even though he was alone then heard a giggle before being pushed out of bed
9375027 better than any young band in recent memory san diegos delta spirit fuses the soulfulness and integrity we associate with bygone eras in american popular music with youthful spirit and a diy sensibility and that makes ode to sunshine more than a promising debut it feels important because it feels like it wont be forgotten in 15 minutes or maybe even 15 years
9375028 all things are possible to them that believe and keep on believing
9375029 and its as if god said im giving it to my kids too and so things took off in a direction i never would have imagined
9375030 what should you do when you come to the door of a house or cabin in this case where god might be should you knock presumably god already knew that mack was there maybe he ought to simply walk in and introduce himself but that seemed equally absurd and how should he address him should he call him father or almighty one or perhaps mr god and would it be best if he fell down and worshipped not that he was really in the mood as he tried to establish some inner mental balance the anger that he thought had so recently died inside him began to emerge no longer concerned or caring about what to call god and energized by his ire he walked up to the door mack decided to bang loudly and see what happened but just as he raised his fist to do so the door flew open and he was looking directly into the face of a large beaming african american woman
9375031 this is a christian novel people bring what they have to the story their fears their questions and doubts their pain and their need
9375032 if they feel closer and have a clearer understanding of god and gods place in their lives the whys and wherefores of their own experiences especially the tragic ones then that is what i hoped would happen with this book
9375033 too often we depend on a set of man made rules to try and relate to god rather than coming to it as an intimate relationship we are expected to play down the hard questions where is god in a world of pain and loss is there a god and if so how is god involved in my life and my darkness my great sadness
9375034 as a preachers kid raised in a different culture sent off to boarding school at a young age well theres a lot of story in all that
9375035 it was slim pickings when we opened five years ago
9375036 we keep everything up to date on labor market information because we dont want people to be retrained for sewing machine jobs when there are no sewing machine jobs it is really important to look ahead five or 10 years at what the labor market is going to do
9375037 sometimes you have been in a box for so long its hard to think outside it but if you can identify transferable skills that you have for another job it might be something you never thought about that you could do even hobbies or things like that but it could take you to another job
9375038 with the fall in the housing market my skills were not in demand
9375039 whatever i did would not just affect me but the whole family
9375040 for me its expanding my knowledge base the more i know the more marketable i am
9375041 its difficult because you are not the new kid on the block but yet you are
9375042 i was one of the last people to leave the plant
9375043 you are separated from the people you worked with every day for years i rarely hear from anybody and i miss those friendships and relationships i had with them
9375044 some of those people had never worked anywhere else and i was really concerned about how they were going to be able to handle being laid off
9375045 i was nervous again interviewing for a job its different when you are on the other side of the table
9375046 i had always wanted to do something in the medical field
9375047 i love my job i really do i enjoy working with medical technology and im using what i learned in school
9375048 has been very helpful taking care of us insurance wise
9375049 they are not sure if they are going to get their vacation pay or anything other than a layoff slip
9375050 i am 55 years old and i dont know if i want to get back into the automobile industry the way it is now i guess my midlife crisis caught up with me
9375051 i would rather take care of my customer and the money will take care of itself
9375052 i am a lot more fortunate than a lot of other people
9375053 my wife says ive started on a new journey i just dont know where im going
9375054 it was a fun job it really was i enjoyed it
9375055 i knew white lily was struggling they kind of let us know six months in advance what was going to happen so i was saving up money and thinking about going to school
9375056 so im still struggling with what i have to do
9375057 im going to have conflicts between school and work and my job is not secure
9375058 i told them you dont understand what is being offered to you you can get trained to do another job you can be an electrician you can be a welder you can learn another trade they are closing a door here but they are also giving us an avenue to something else
9375059 i think they actually forgot about me because it was such a fast decision they made it on sunday
9375060 the career center has been very good they gave me a gas card to go to school every week and in fact today i pick up vouchers for my uniforms and my books
9375061 the old counting method was good at showing population trends but not at specific numbers
9375062 for gray bats to get de listed were going to need hard accurate data
9375063 i was using this equipment last night when i started seeing a form on the camera screen moving back and forth
9375064 anything they pick up on their echolocation and can fit in their mouths theyll eat
9375065 it doesnt take much human disturbance for bats to leave their summer site
9375066 my guess is someone was going in there repeatedly maybe digging for indian artifacts
9375067 in the old days people would spend years perfecting their methods and learning to count bats
9375068 if they were within 1 000 to 3 000 bats that was considered pretty accurate i dont know how they did it
9375069 not all of these folks are looking for hand outs or to take advantage of our generosity
9375070 these people in no perfectly know what can occur there in regards to natural disasters but yet many still stay and make no preparations for it instead they rely on the gov to hold their hand
9375071 wed even kick in some cash just to close the deal
9375072 they called me later and said they did take it up in the woods and set it off so it was live
9375073 i was standing there wondering what i was going to do with that thing
9375074 i laid it up in the shed and just kind of forgot about it
9375075 the biggest thing i was worried about in that shed was finding snakes
9375076 last year when apple released the iphone in the united states i thought it would be great if i could create applications for that but there was no sdk at the time then later that year in november google released the android sdk and announced the android developer challenge i decided to take a look and that turned out to be a great choice
9375077 what i really wanted to do was develop an iphone app the iphone sdk wasnt out yet though
9375078 i have my own company that i can invest in
9375079 right now i am focusing on android and i want to make sure that picsay will run on the actual android based phone when it is launched it is possible to create an iphone version of picsay and i would like to do that some day but there is no time for that now
9375080 i guess i could invest it in my software company but first i want to port picsay to the iphone
9375081 being referred to as lady of the outcrop sounds like i have a bad case of chickenpox
9375082 it is a super place to live a one off it is magical especially when you see the dolphins playing and the fishing boats coming and going
9375083 not yet but i think i have an idea of where to look a hunch at least
9375084 but theres probably no point i dont think wed luck onto him even with twenty planes buzzing around the countryside either my hunch will play out or it wont and either way more planes arent going to make much difference i will give you a call if we need you though count on that much
9375085 yeah i think so thanks you going to join us again tomorrow
9375086 you should be good just to follow the road if jays gotten that far hell stick to it
9375087 its him waving a blanket or something can you land down there vi
9375088 fine thanks it blew over in the night howd you know
9375089 would you believe that some dude poked me with a burning stick
9375090 and if its anything to do with the hallucinations ive been having i think i may have been better off without it ah well too late now
9375091 if i let the engine cool too much more well have to give it a full half hour before i can start it up again
9375092 i was starting to think i was going to be walking all the way back
9375093 all for one and all that crap one day it might be me and id damn well expect you guys to come looking
9375094 yeah i made a promise i have yet to fulfill
9375095 youve got a bunch of pretty angry messenger pilots who were all in favour of storming in there with all the guns they could find if you can spare half a day how about we head home and round them up then you can have yourself an army to do what you got to do
9375096 i dont think its about us at all theyre just pissed that someone thinks they can shoot messenger planes out of the air you hurt one of us you hurt all of us kind of thing
9375097 im gonna sit right down and right myself a letter
9375098 i have to give them room to put their own stamps on each of the roles and in the process i try to shake the show and make it unique and original once again
9375099 what i tell each of the five singers is each of them has a theme in the show if we are successful we will create a character arc they will be able to ride from the beginning to the end if we are really really successful we end up with seven characters which also includes the piano player and fats waller himself
9375100 i wonder what the poor people are doing id love to be doing it with them
9375101 last season for us was probably the hardest in terms of making it through the season

9375105 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9375106 if so why were they were not mentioned at the founding in the new deal or great society
9375107 why are they not treated as rights by most people today
9375108 what level of health care and education should be provided to meet the right
9375109 to me these seem to be different the other rights and peole might reject their services is that ok
9375110 do we have other rights which are more universally accepted that require similar costs to be imposed on everyone
9375111 do we have any rights that government does not guarantee
9375112 the decrease in medicare and the rising price of gas has sapped our financial reserves
9375113 the hurricane is scheduled to hit the city on tuesday
9375114 someone who cares about other people and who likes to study and learn
9375115 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans

9375121 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded
9375122 i think we can activate an e mail list of a couple of million people who want to give back
9375123 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9375124 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9375125 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9375126 i think thats when the campaign for national office began
9375127 a lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about whos next
9375128 our organization will continue we will be on the streets
9375129 we spent so much time trying to welcome people to the city and now this is the way we start out

9375134 hey thanks so much for coming over the toys in annes room are taking over the world
9375135 i only wish i was kidding the problem is that she remembers all of them by name and who gave them to her which makes getting rid of them next to impossible
9375136 my plan is to have you put these up along the full wall and then put all the animals up there do you think it will work
9375137 looks like it will do you have a stud finder
9375138 i forgot to warn you that emily is coming over in an hour
9375139 i know em why would it bother me that shes going to be here
9375140 of all the things i expected you to say that wasnt one of them dont worry porn doesnt offend me although being in this room while the two of you watch it together might be interesting
9375141 i guess ill have to hurry so that you two can get to it
9375142 i cant believe you arranged to have jim in the house moments before our porn fest you must have balls like rocks
9375143 those balls are more like cannon balls i think and they are bordering on the explosive side so youd better stand back
9375144 if you actually had balls i am certain they would be close to exploding when eric was alive you two had sex more often than a bushel of bunnies i cant believe youve been able to go this long without
9375145 i think that might be a little optimistic considering that i havent actually had sex yet besides ive started thinking that maybe im not that person anymore maybe that person went away and this battery dependent person took her place
9375146 no that person is still in there shes just been depressed and sad for a long time but now she needs to come out and play
9375147 im not so sure about that im not sure i can be that person without eric im not sure about anything
9375148 anything other than maybe tying jim to the bed and fucking him until he cries out and pleads for mercy
9375149 it wouldnt be a bad thing i guess its just that im out of practice i dont know how to do this anymore
9375150 well come on it isnt like i can just walk up to him and say gee id really like to do the horizontal bop with you
9375151 i dont see why not youd be doing him a favor hes a man and men think with their penises he wouldnt need to work for it then
9375152 just invite him to join us go up to him and say so jim emily and i are thinking about having a wild orgy and wondered if youd like to join us that ought to get his attention
9375153 yeah i do watching porn with two women and wondering whatll happen next has to come close to some sort of ultra male fantasy it may not even be necessary to mention the orgy part its time to put those batteries away and remind yourself what real hard flesh feels like
9375154 emily i already mentioned the porn thing to him and hes hurrying right now to get done so he can leave
9375155 just that you were coming over and we were going to watch porn together i didnt want to offend him or anything if he wasnt done working he didnt act like he wanted to stay
9375156 look well just ask theres no harm in that right
9375157 just take it one step at a time ill be there watching giving you moral support
9375158 well then well just have to make sure things go well
9375159 uh good good i think its going a little slower than i figured but they look nice you had a great idea
9375160 emily is here and we were getting ready to make banana daiquiris would you like one
9375161 of course i have one id never invite you over without having some in the house ill ill be right back
9375162 i know watch adult movies you told me earlier its okay im not easily offended
9375163 emily i cant do it i just dont think the guy is interested
9375164 now thats the wonderful thing about fantasy i may never do something like that in real life but damn its nice to watch and think about
9375165 it is nice to think about course for me right now just having sex is nice to think about
9375166 so what do you have for our viewing pleasure next
9375167 its one of jennas earlier movies flashpoint she stars as a firefighter
9375168 it will be interesting to see if she spends more time in or out of uniform
9375169 i guess hes done lets just watch the movie hell come out when hes ready
9375170 yeah the shelves went up easily and they look like theyll do the job go look at annes room when you get a chance if you see anything that needs to be fixed just give me a call and ill come back
9375171 why dont you stay for awhile and watch the movie with us
9375172 if you get uncomfortable we love to watch or help
9375173 actually i heard it all these walls are paper thin
9375174 so you knew i was going to ask you to stay
9375175 well as reluctant as you sounded im not going to say that i knew i hoped
9375176 if you knew i wanted you why make me work so hard it took you forever to respond
9375177 i wanted to make sure that this was really what you wanted
9375178 me that i was what you wanted even if for just today i couldnt let you feel guilty tomorrow
9375179 you know though i could have sworn i heard the word orgy coming from both of you
9375180 for now im content to watch you two this is better than the movie
9375181 about that orgy i feel bad for leaving emily out
9375182 are you saying what i think you are because i cant say no to an invitation like that
9375183 what do we think i can tell you what i think
9375184 maybe you should sit down cause i think well be down here for awhile i wouldnt want you to fall and hurt yourself
9375185 you know there is a serious natural resource crisis going on right now it would be so much more resourceful if youd both just join me
9375186 im glad you stayed so that i could tell you that in person
9375187 we fully expect to be running for re election in 2010 and we want to have a strong campaign ready to go
9375188 tim murray understands the importance of having a strong campaign
9375189 for tim murray theres nothing like putting away the money for that rainy day and that rainy day could be deval patrick being appointed to an executive position if barack obama is elected
9375190 its just common sense that any politician should be raising money throughout their term in office
9375191 were focused on winning seats for 08 and helping win massachusetts for john mccain
9375192 as more people across the state get to know tim murray and see the good work that the patrick murray administration has done they want to be supportive of it
9375193 dan lain lain tetapi kalau mereka melihat kamu adalah perempuan yang baik perhatian dan peduli hmm siapa yang bisa menolak kehadiran kamu
9375194 this is important its up to us to do this even if no one else takes notice
9375195 why do you have to do this whos making you
9375196 why arent you in the stadium you should be playing there
9375197 when jim died was your walk with the lord close enough that his love and comfort and presence were sufficient at all times or did grief and sorrow at times overtake and overwhelm you
9375198 lead me to the rock that is higher than i
9375199 i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year
9375200 because every time you know maybe things werent looking that great
9375201 the real men and women of madison avenue and their impact on american culture
9375202 think of this site as a more up to date summary of the book
9375203 putting uhw under trusteeship would be viewed by many as a sign that internal democracy is not valued or tolerated within the seiu
9375204 in particular in may 2007 the defendants began to fear contrary to fact that seiu was planning to appoint a trustee to run the affairs of the local union and remove them from office
9375205 on the specific issue you raise we agree that trusteeships should never be used to limit democratic debate in any union

9375451 theyre still figuring out what our expectations are and how were doing things on a daily basis were trying to break some habits and ask some guys to change some ways and thats always going to take a little bit of time
9375452 when he came to the cougs i knew he was a good player
9375453 hes maybe exceeded our expectations this early now we havent played a game yet and hes going to have some growing pains in games but based on practice hes a very good football player with a tremendous amount of upside
9375454 hes the kind of guy who could be a four year starter in the program
9375455 hes got good mental toughness hes got good ability and i think his ability will only improve as he gets stronger through the offseason and develops from a physical standpoint hes got a lot of room for that area hes deceivingly wise for his age again hes going to go into his first game and im sure hes going to make his mistakes but we know what were getting were getting someone who is going to compete and if he has a chance to make a play hes probably going to make it
9375456 we hope for cal we need him back but we want to be smart its a 14 week season counting the bye and we surely dont want to bring him back too early where he aggravates it and we miss him for the next six weeks hes getting better
9375457 we were impressed with him in the spring by his toughness and aggressiveness and then also at fall camp hes been very very good he brings some violence to the position hes an explosive get off the ball kind of guy hes very tough and we like those guys
9375458 it surprised us a little bit but it didnt completely surprise us i know he was struggling a little bit and there was a lot of competition going on a lot of factors in there its been a chronic thing for him and it goes beyond this fall camp i think has gone on now for a couple years sometimes you can only sustain x amount of pain for so long and decide its just not worth it i believe thats basically just the conclusion he came to
9375459 wednesday we went through a drill and he was 6 for 6 and kicked the ball extremely well im pretty confident hes going to do a good job
9375460 get out of bed you fat lazy sack of crap
9375461 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
9375462 we should have had coventry dead and buried in the first 90 minutes
9375463 for most of that time i was virtually a spectator and all i could keep on thinking was that i hoped we were not going to rue all our missed chances
9375464 in a way we did because they took the game into extra time but in the end we were ok
9375465 coventry scored a late goal in the first half a late goal at the end of the second half and very nearly grabbed a late goal at the end of the first period of extra time when they hit the crossbar
9375466 really you couldnt make it up and we were very disappointed with the two goals they did score
9375467 that goal just before half time from my republic of ireland colleague clinton morrison gave them a lift a throw in for their second goal came in like a missile and we had struggled to cope with this
9375468 when extra time gets under way you start thinking about penalties and what a nightmare they would have been
9375469 but at the end of the day we are just happy to be in the next round and thats the most important thing
9375470 je suis si heureuse que ton p re ait bien voulu apprendre danser tu vois ce que je veux dire oui moi je ne le croyais pas capable il fait vraiment a pour toi

9375480 we are deeply concerned about the safety and welfare of the residents of the gulf state region our top priority is to assist those who will be affected by hurricane gustav this is not a time for politics or celebration it is a time for us to come together as americans and assist the residents of the gulf states
9375481 in order for the republican party to officially exist and for senator mccain to qualify for the ballot we are by law required to conduct specific official business at this point our program on monday has been scaled back and will only include what party rules governing the nomination of our candidates for president and vice president require we will perform the official business as required in addition we have set aside time to make delegates and americans watching our proceedings at home aware of what they can do to assist in relief efforts designed to help those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9375482 at some point between monday and thursday evening we will convene once again to complete the activities needed to qualify senator mccain and governor palin for the ballot in all 50 states beyond that all we can say is that we will monitor what is happening and make decisions about other convention business as details become available
9375483 the safety and well being of the people of the gulf states remains our top concern we are doing everything we can on the ground in minneapolis saint paul to ensure that the delegations affected by this storm have the resources and information that they need as senator mccain said this morning we must redirect our attention and efforts we will act as americans not republicans to help our fellow citizens in need
9375484 we appreciate the thoughts and prayers of everyone around the country as we prepare for this dangerous storm we are here in minnesota for the necessary job of nominating our choice for president and vice president but obviously our focus is on our families and friends back at home we are in constant communication with our governors and elected officials and feel confident that they are taking the appropriate and necessary steps to prepare the purpose of this group is to discuss ways that we can come together to provide information and support for our delegates here in minneapolis
9375485 as we all watch and prepare for gustav to make landfall it is important that the convention make it as easy as possible for delegates to be where they are needed most with their families and local agencies in their home states we are grateful to senator mccain for making this resource available to the delegates from the gulf states
9375486 in the wake of the u s supreme court decision upholding the detainees right to challenge their detention in court and as congress scrutinizes the authorization of harsh interrogation techniques activists are joining the mounting chorus to urge the bush administration to shut down guantanamo
9375487 it is time to counter terror with justice on american soil and abroad
9375488 guantanamo continues to be the shameful global icon of this administrations outright disregard for basic human dignity and the rule of law
9375489 by assaulting core american values including the right to challenge ones incarceration and allowing techniques long associated with dictators and despots president bush has squandered the united states moral leadership around the world its time to remove the ugly blot on the america we believe in and shut down guantanamo
9375490 the mississippi gaming commission has issued an order for our casino to close however our hotel which is not located on the water remains open we are taking all safety precautions and encourage our guests and employees to seek shelter in a safe area
9375491 a storm surge of more than 15 foot would put extreme pressure on new orleans flood defenses the city is still vulnerable to a surge from the east as happened during hurricane katrina and to a lesser extent from lake pontchartrain to the north
9375492 the levees have been strengthened since katrina but only about a quarter of the planned work on the citys flood defenses has been completed which would provide protection against a hurricane that occurs on average once every one hundred years
9375493 losses to the offshore platforms will be extremely sensitive to gustavs extract track and intensity a slight shift to the west than the current projected path would mean gustav will hit more platforms and if it strengthens the damage will be greater so the losses will be in the upper range
9375494 however if the storm is weaker than currently projected or moves slightly further east then losses will be towards the lower end
9375495 after two relatively quiet seasons for landfalling u s hurricanes we are seeing a return to the frequency of events we would expect in this new period of heightened activity which weve been experiencing since 1995 hurricane hanna is following hot on the heels of gustav and we are yet to reach the peak of the season which occurs around mid september
9375496 the feeding america network is a critical part of the disaster relief infrastructure
9375497 feeding america is one of dozens of relief organizations providing an array of relief services in this situation our primary mission remains providing emergency food distribution throughout the year in times of disaster like these we ramp up operations significantly to help communities caught in the grip of tragedy
9375498 feeding america will deploy its immediate disaster area reconnaissance team idart as soon as it is safe and practicable
9375499 this team will be deployed to assess the type and amount of assistance that will be needed from our network of food banks and will expand as necessary
9375500 we established hurricanehousingsearch org in 2005 to help the hundreds of thousands of families who were made homeless by hurricane katrina
9375501 we want those who are being displaced by hurricane gustav and hanna to know hurricanehousingsearch org is still available to help them locate temporary housing finding such housing is imperative and this site is simply our small way of contributing to what needs to be an all out nationwide effort
9375502 all of us who populate cyberspace talk about the internet community so much that the phrase sometimes has very little meaning
9375503 hurricanehousingsearch org is our ongoing effort to make that concept a reality at critical moments like these moments when a sense of community on and off the internet is so desperately needed i urge both homeowners who want to help mitigate this disaster survivors who may eventually gain access to a computer and shelter directors fema field workers and red cross officials to visit and make use of hurricanehousingsearch org
9375504 americans to help other americans whenever and wherever disasters forcing people from their homes occur
9375505 when disaster strikes your home or business all you want to do is get your life back to normal fast
9375506 our local service technicians are trained to respond immediately because damage from water and bacteria growth can begin within hours call 1 800 respond 737 7663 to reach a disaster restoration specialist in your area
9375507 i believe helicopter assistance is coming in at the moment with paramedics and doctors and those sorts of people to try and assist that driver
9375508 as we progress throughout the peak it really does start to build up from here so wed expect some major delays starting to build up in the morning peak
9375509 globally we are seeing the growth of the majors and unless we are able to build a food manufacturing business in australia that is sustainable then ultimately the global manufacturers will take the power base
9375510 well coordinate searches on the high tide on south stradbroke island looking for debris
9375511 vladimir putin not only managed to see the giant predator up close but also saved our television crew too
9375512 first of all we must thank our colleagues americans european colleagues for being involved with this during a difficult time for russia when no one was paying any attention to this
9375513 stoner was going very fast but i had a good feeling with my bike then i saw him slipping
9375514 were now in a position where well be able to settle the agreement this week
9375515 well be formally voting on the agreement later in the week and well also be in a process of consultation around the redundancies and other changes that the company announced on tuesday
9375516 there will be no recriminations in relation to any matter arising from the industrial dispute
9375517 were going to travel down to texas tomorrow to visit with the emergency operations centre in austin where coordination among federal state and local government officials is occurring
9375518 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9375519 you go directly to the big house in general population you go directly to angola prison and god bless you when you go there
9375520 you cant rely on the low cost airlines its very risky
9375521 to encourage the arrival of more tourists in granada we have to keep working to connect granada with foreign cities
9375522 a milestone in the consolidation of the german banking sector
9375523 dont you find it a beautiful clean thought a world empty of people just uninterrupted grass and a hare sitting up
9375524 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself
9375525 as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9375526 we are putting together a dvd with all the replays we have and sending it to mlb tomorrow
9375527 we had to send a call in earlier this season and got it reversed so hopefully we can go 2 for 2
9375528 segala amal kebajikan anak adam itu dilipat gandakan pahalanya kepada sepuluh hinggalah ke 700 kali ganda kecuali puasa sesungguhnya puasa itu adalah untukku dan aku allah memberikan balasan pahala kepadanya kerana dia orang yang berpuasa telah meninggalkan syahwat dan makan minumnya kerana aku
9375529 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9375530 palin is mccains bridge to nowhere thanks but no thanks
9375531 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress
9375532 people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because theyve been under these misperceptions about the bridge and the purpose said palin who described the link as the ketchikan areas potential for expansion and growth palin said alaskas congressional delegation worked hard to obtain funding for the bridge and that she would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge 8 8 06 we need to come to the defense of southeast alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something thats so negative palin said
9375533 thanks but no thanks if we want a bridge well build it ourselves
9375534 as you remember during hurricane katrina we didnt have a system like that in place and it was very difficult for families to locate family members
9375535 when i got asked to do this show i asked them are you sure im the guy to do this project
9375536 i usually come to an audition with my own music and routines
9375537 as i started moving i thought i want this to look kind of african
9375538 i didnt want to turn it into a hip hop show
9375539 people who come expecting to see that are going to be disappointed
9375540 theyve really grasped what i want they have varying abilities but theyre all really good and theyre working their butts off just like i am
9375541 the time we have to learn everything is very very very short
9375542 ive never experienced anything like this in my life its a lead role which is a first for me and you have to get everything memorized right away
9375543 shes very vibrant very sure of herself and very fast in her thought processes shes pretty much like me to a surprising degree
9375544 to me its like a romeo and juliet story it has a lot of spirituality and a lot of love and pain all wrapped into one yes it has an all black cast but the theme is universal i think it adds authenticity to the location thats the main thing
9375545 she has experience not only in politics but in life
9375546 shes a mother of five children and she has more experience than barack obama
9375547 governor palin took on ted stevens if she can take him on she can take on the russians
9375548 palin is commander in chief of the alaskan national guard
9375549 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9375550 if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far more experience than senator obama does
9375551 there are a lot of other republican women who could have filled this role if that is what he was looking for
9375552 maybe its my own background as a mayor and united states attorney but this whole idea of executive experience to me would really qualify her
9375553 you know why she had to make decisions all sen obama has had to do is talk thats all he does
9375554 no doubt the campaign staff have her hooked up to a fire hose on foreign policy issues
9375555 no doubt they fear a debate with joe biden that touches foreign affairs
9375556 my guess is graham and joe lieberman are doing a lot of tutoring
9375557 the experience issue is on the other side the no 1 guy there is the guy without the experience
9375558 we do have extensive plans to respond wherever the storm is going to go
9375559 ill change the name of the blog w domain late dont worryr
9375560 ok god said dont steal i can do that dont fornicate i think i can do that repent and be baptized ok i can do that be sober minded eh i dont think thats important i want to get drunk tonight
9375561 i believed and therefore did speak we also believe and therefore also we speak
9375562 ceos salaries and benefits are getting fatter and fatter while workers face soaring gas prices foreclosures and rising health care costs
9375563 the employee free choice act gives workers the freedom to form a union so they can earn better wages retirement security and health care coverage
9375564 well take any delegate that would like to go back
9375565 the mccain campaign has assured me this is the first priority
9375566 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9375567 as important as this convention is the safety and welfare of american citizens is the no 1 priority so everything is being adjusted but not canceled
9375568 i just felt nervous having them there in this storm and me not being there
9375569 he went to italy with the knowledge of the foreign office in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9375570 there is no doubt that bryans with or without authority from lord halifax endeavoured to go to germany to contact german foreign minister ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself
9375571 were going to make sure that equal pay for equal work is a reality in this country
9375572 seems like a very engaging person nice person but ive got to say shes opposed like john mccain is to equal pay for equal work that doesnt make much sense to me
9375573 i am all in favor of pay equity for women but this kind of legislation opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
9375574 were going to invest 15 billion a year in making highly efficient cars of the future right here in ohio right here in america
9375575 windmills and solar panels and biofuels right here in ohio creating millions of jobs that cant be exported
9375576 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9375577 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9375578 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9375579 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9375580 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9375581 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9375582 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9375583 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9375584 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9375585 of course when you become governor things come into much sharper focus than when you are a candidate
9375586 then she is forced to pay very close attention to the fiscal realities of it
9375587 ceos salaries and benefits are getting fatter and fatter while workers face soaring gas prices foreclosures and rising health care costs
9375588 the employee free choice act gives workers the freedom to form a union so they can earn better wages retirement security and health care coverage
9375589 fifteen percent looks small but the impact is larger than meets the eye
9375590 louisiana refineries supply a chunk of the southern states product needs gasoline diesel whatever
9375591 that could keep a lot of those refineries shut down for awhile because you have to deal with flooding and power outages
9375592 if that capacity remains shut down for an extended amount of time you could see prices really start to rise four dollar gasoline is not out of the question
9375593 we do have extensive plans to respond wherever the storm is going to go
9375594 we believe our systems are extremely reliable but when youre facing a storm approaching 150 or more miles per hour there are no sure bets
9375595 all the countries in the international community are looking for more and greater leadership from the united states
9375596 we are going to march into the arms of police whatever they are going to do is all right with us
9375597 i am not where i want to be but you can always say that about your swing i feel better i am learning to pace myself
9375598 i am hoping to get back before the season ends
9375599 its a double edged sword and its either your co workers or your family
9375600 some of us are much stronger than others i know several officers who were fired they were damned good officers
9375601 the superintendent has done everything possible to ensure the officers will stay in and hes confident none of them will leave
9375602 short of another katrina our community is confident the force will take care of our needs
9375603 those problems are not indicative or reflective of the force as a whole
9375604 the force as a whole is doing a good job
9375605 i have a lot of admiration for the police that stayed
9375606 i couldnt tell you what i would do in that scenario not knowing where my family is
9375607 you cant perform your job if youre worried about where your family is regardless of your occupation
9375608 they re the same ones you ll remember from back when the washington republicans were violating them less regulation smaller government an end to bureaucratic social engineering
9375609 but the urge to stick their fingers into other people s business is too much for even republicans to resist as the bush years have shown the draft platform condemns the current tax code for its endless complications for example and then proposes several ways to make it more complicated a tax free lost earnings buffer account and a farm savings account more elaborate tax free accounts for education and medical expenses credits for people who don t get health insurance at work and enough alternative fuel tax incentives to make t boone pickens hop up and down in anticipation
9375610 the anti drug fight in venezuela has shown significant progress during recent years especially since the government ended official cooperation programs with the dea
9375611 i dont know how much were going to sell them for now but the price is going to have to go up
9375612 weve been out of food since yesterday the people outside are screaming
9375613 life is like living in a cloud for us we never know what is going to happen
9375614 well take any delegate that would like to go back
9375615 the mccain campaign has assured me this is the first priority
9375616 im trying to get my family out of there and stay here for the week
9375617 as important as this convention is the safety and welfare of american citizens is the no 1 priority so everything is being adjusted but not canceled
9375618 i just felt nervous having them there in this storm and me not being there
9375619 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9375620 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9375621 russia today has found itself more isolated than the soviet union ever was
9375622 what we are calling for is sanctions addressing those individuals business and officials who by their actions current or future seek to somehow continue to violate our territorial integrity
9375623 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia

9375628 the rule of law means guaranteeing to law enforcement the tools and coordination to deport criminal aliens without delay
9375629 it means requiring cooperation among federal state and local law enforcement and real consequences including the denial of federal funds for self described sanctuary cities which stand in open defiance of the federal and state statutes that expressly prohibit such sanctuary policies and which endanger the lives of u s citizens
9375630 we oppose amnesty the rule of law suffers if government policies encourage or reward illegal activity
9375631 i would push for federal action to carry out a federal responsibility and a federal responsibility is immigration its not a city or a state or a sheriffs responsibility
9375632 we fail at the federal level to pass federal legislation so youre going to have these different activities and different actions by different levels of government all of which are because of the failure of federal government to enact comprehensive immigration reform
9375633 i would have to look at the particular situations first of all i dont know if i could do it legally to start with secondly but i would attack the issue so that it would go away
9375634 you secure borders and you have a temporary worker program that works you address the issue of the 12 million people who are here illegally and you dont have to worry about that
9375635 i think were all a little bit anxious about this storm simply because of the path
9375636 we get ready earlier than we used to years ago
9375637 we feel like its easier to pull back than it is in the last hours to try to move forward
9375638 these storms have and do move around quite a bit
9375639 no one single agency can manage a disaster like that on its own and private and public partnerships can help
9375640 were already seeing increased activity particular in our new orleans stores
9375641 people want to make sure they have their medication on them in the event they have to evacuate
9375642 i dont think any of them are rooting for a hurricane to hit their towns but in the past it has helped
9375643 im glad more and more alaskans are recognizing this nonsensical situation

9375655 parental alienation is about people who narcissistically project their whole reality onto a child i dont need you so the child doesnt need you
9375656 the goal of the alienating parent is to kill contiguous time people need reliability they need regularity and ive been the victim of a campaign to kill all that you wind up being more an uncle than a father

9375669 karena itu barangsiapa di antara kamu menyaksikan di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan tersebut
9375670 apabila bulan telah masuk kedua puluh sembilan malam dari bulan syaban pen maka janganlah kalian berpuasa hingga melihat hilal dan apabila mendung sempurnakanlah bulan syaban menjadi tiga puluh hari
9375671 sesungguhnya kami adalah umat ummiyah kami tidak mengenal kitabah tulis menulis dan tidak pula mengenal hisab bulan itu seperti ini beliau berisyarat dengan bilangan 29 dan seperti ini beliau berisyarat dengan bilangan 30
9375672 dan tiadalah yang nabi ucapkan itu menurut kemauan hawa nafsunya ucapannya itu tiada lain hanyalah wahyu allah yang diwahyukan kepadanya
9375673 menetapkan ramadhan dengan ruyah adalah kesepakatan para salaf para sahabat dan kesepakatan ini adalah hujjah bantahan kepada mereka yang menggunakan hisab
9375674 mazhab ini yang menetapkan awal ramadhan dengan hisab adalah mazhab batil dan syariat ini telah melarang mendalami ilmu nujum hisab karena ilmu ini hanya sekedar perkiraan dzon dan bukanlah ilmu yang pasti qothi atau persangkaan kuat maka seandainya suatu perkara misalnya penentuan awal ramadhan pen hanya dikaitkan dengan ilmu hisab ini maka agama ini akan menjadi sempit karena tidak ada yang menguasai ilmu hisab ini kecuali sedikit sekali
9375675 janganlah kalian mendahului ramadhan dengan berpuasa satu atau dua hari sebelumnya kecuali bagi seseorang yang terbiasa mengerjakan puasa pada hari tersebut maka puasalah
9375676 barangsiapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka dia telah mendurhakai abul qasim yaitu rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pen
9375677 puasa kalian ditetapkan tatkala mayoritas kalian berpuasa idul fithri ditetapkan tatkala mayoritas kalian beridul fithri dan idul adha ditetapkan tatkala mayoritas kalian beridul adha
9375678 sebagian para ulama menafsirkan hadits ini dengan mengatakan maksud hadits ini adalah puasa dan hari raya hendaknya dilakukan bersama jamaah yaitu pemerintah kaum muslimin dan mayoritas manusia masyarakat

9375681 mayor bloombergs dance around the citys term limits law shows no signs of ending as he said yesterday that the question of allowing a third term is one that is worthy of debate
9375682 a majority of new york council members support or are open to overturning the term limit law that will force most of them and mayor michael r bloomberg from office in 16 months according to a telephone survey conducted by the new york times
9375683 as he weighs a bid to rewrite new york citys term limits mayhor michael r bloomberg is encountering an unlikely group of opponents his own aides
9375684 three of mr bloombergs most trusted advisors deputy mayors edward skyler patricia e harris and kevin sheekey have confided to associates that they oppose revising the citys election laws so that he can seek a third term according to people familiar with the conversations
9375685 mayor bloomberg risks irreparably tainting his brand by so blatantly reversing himself and ignoring the will of the people on term limits
9375686 die letzten sonnenstrahlen erw rmten die m den knochen es tat gut schnell zu laufen wieder mal auszuschreiten den puls auf touren bringen das laub knisterte unter jedem schritt und die farben des herbstes malten ein heiteres bild

9375729 also gut morgen vormittag hab ich noch frei dann werden wir uns mal an die arbeit machen
9375730 was meinst du h ttest du lust mal ins thermalbad zu gehen kannst du denn berhaupt schwimmen
9375731 wenn ich nicht schwimmen kann wer dann bin eine ausgesprochene wasserratte
9375732 das trifft sich ja gut dann spricht ja nichts gegen einen besuch im thermalbad dort gibt es kinderbecken freiluftbecken und wenn du gl ck hast da angrenzend ans bad auch eine wiese mit wald ist vielleicht sogar jemanden aus deiner verwandtschaft
9375733 oh das w re sch n denn ein bisschen vermiss ich sie doch wenn es mir auch bei dir sehr gut gef llt
9375734 also gut wenn ich mich umziehe drehst du dich um und wenn du dich umziehst dreh ich mich um abgemacht

9375736 ein wichtel den ich schon sehr lange liebe nur wei er es nicht
9375737 tr ste dich er wird wahrscheinlich meine kleine in ihrem schicken badeanzug nicht erkannt haben wir waren ja nicht das letzte mal hier du siehst in bestimmt wieder
9375738 schau wir gehen n chste woche wieder ins thermalbad und dann machen wir es so wenn wir gen gend geschwommen sind werden wir uns wieder anziehen und dann in den angrenzenden wald spazieren gehen pilu ist bestimmt irgendwo in der n he
9375739 na jetzt mach aber mal langsam was wir alles anstellen werden ist die woche sehr schnell vor ber wirst sehen
9375740 morgen zum beispiel k nnten wir eine bahnfahrt d h ein seilbahn fahrt unternehmen machst mit
9375741 es ist der berg auf den die einzige hier am ort und gleichzeitig die lteste seilbahn im orginalzustand noch funktionierende in ganz deutschland geht besser gesagt f hrt
9375742 na also so gef llst du mir schon wieder besser
9375743 es tut mir ja so leid aber die bergfahrt muss leider ausfallen
9375744 na ganz einfach weil du noch keine passenden schuhe hast
9375745 ja aber nicht f r den berg die die du hast sind gut f rs flache land aber nicht f r den berg dort brauchst du feste schuhe
9375746 hab den schuhmacher schon beauftragt dass er dir welche macht
9375747 er hat mir versprochen dass sie bis bermorgen fertig sind
9375748 na wie w rs wenn wir noch mal ins thermalbad gingen
9375749 doch doch nur ach du wei t doch ich will schauen ob ich pilu erwische
9375750 sollten wir nicht lieber erst unsere sachen im auto verstauen so haben wir ja st ndig die h nde beim laufen
9375751 wenns denn sein muss gut drehn wir um und bringen erst unsere sachen ins auto
9375752 hab dich auch schon l nger beobachtet bist mir nicht unbemerkt geblieben
9375753 pass blo auf das dir der nicht zu nahe kommt
9375754 ich will pilu wieder sehn und nicht erst wenn wir wieder zum baden gehen
9375755 ach daher weht der wind meine kleine ist verliebt und hat sehnsucht
9375756 w rs nicht m glich das wir zum wald gehen auch ohne zu baden ich will ihn unbedingt wieder sehn und nicht erst in einer woche sondern morgen zumindest bermorgen
9375757 ich wei es nicht ich wei nur eins ich muss ihn wieder sehn
9375758 ich hab da eine idee nur ist die etwas ausgefallen
9375759 also gut ich lass dir f r dich ein passendes fahrrad bauen hab da einen guten mann an der hand der w rde es f r mich machen tja und dann
9375760 hei t es f r dich fahrradfahren lernen glaubst du du schaffst das
9375761 und wenn du das fahrradfahren erlernt hast kannst jeden tag zu pilu radeln was h ltst davon
9375762 erstens mal sieht er dich nicht und w rde in ohnmacht fallen wenn pl tzlich sein kleines fahrrad alleine davon f hrt
9375763 das k nnen wir auch morgen nach der bergtour mitnehmen dann haben wir nur einen weg und m ssen nicht extra in die stadt
9375764 es kommt ein film ber den bregenzer wald dort habe ich verwandtschaft vielleicht seh ich einen diejenigen die den film drehten wissen ja nicht das unsichtbare wichtel im film allerdings nur f r wichtel zu sehen sind bitte ja
9375765 einverstanden aber danach ab ins bett du wei t war wir morgen vorhaben

9375767 hab ich alles von dir gelernt bin ein gelehriger sch ler lach
9375768 ich habe ne idee wir k nnten uns eigentlich das zweite ticket f r die bahn sparen wenn du in meiner hosentasche bleibst
9375769 nein nein meine liebe du willst doch nicht schon am anfang unserer tour rasten wollen hast doch noch gar nichts getan au er mir unsinnige melodien ins ohr zu singen den n chsten abschnitt unserer wanderung die bis zum dreisesselberg geht darfst du auch mal laufen kleine wichteline sonst wirst du ja gar so faul
9375770 sag schon ich m chte zugern wissen was so ein vogel denkt
9375771 also gut sie ist nun schon seit 3 jahren hier oben und hat manche wetterst rme erlebt aber das dollste von allem sind doch die wanderer die eine in sandalen der andere in turnschuh die eine im twintop der andere im unterhemd die eine mit handtasche der andere mit bauchtasche sie wunderts dass so viele heil rauf und wieder runterkommen bei der ausr stung doch hat sie schon manchen davon abst rzen sehen
9375772 kann ich mir gut vorstellen bei dem leichtsinn was mancher an den tag legt
9375773 hat es doch auch was gutes lach das so viele
9375774 oh wie sch n das ich dieses herrliche tier auch mal live erleben darf
9375775 einen meter neben dir hat sich eine kreuzotter zum sonnenbad eingeringelt nicht ber hren und nicht zu nahe dran vorbei
9375776 nein nein meine liebe du willst doch nicht schon am anfang unserer tour rasten wollen hast doch noch gar nichts getan au er mir unsinnige melodien ins ohr zu singen den n chsten abschnitt unserer wanderung die bis zum dreisesselberg geht darfst du auch mal laufen kleine wichteline sonst wirst du ja gar so faul
9375777 sag schon ich m chte zugern wissen was so ein vogel denkt
9375778 also gut sie ist nun schon seit 3 jahren hier oben und hat manche wetterst rme erlebt aber das dollste von allem sind doch die wanderer die eine in sandalen der andere in turnschuh die eine im twintop der andere im unterhemd die eine mit handtasche der andere mit bauchtasche sie wunderts dass so viele heil rauf und wieder runterkommen bei der ausr stung doch hat sie schon manchen davon abst rzen sehen
9375779 kann ich mir gut vorstellen bei dem leichtsinn was mancher an den tag legt
9375780 hat es doch auch was gutes lach das so viele
9375781 oh wie sch n das ich dieses herrliche tier auch mal live erleben darf
9375782 einen meter neben dir hat sich eine kreuzotter zum sonnenbad eingeringelt nicht ber hren und nicht zu nahe dran vorbei
9375783 du kannst in doch nicht hacken lass es sonst bin ich dir b se
9375784 wir werden uns schon einig meinte er schmunzelnd und tats chlich bei 230 war dann auch ich zufrieden wollte schon sagen er solls mir einpacken besann mich aber dann doch da es etwas seltsam klang da ich einen rucksack dabei hatte war es kein problem das kleine gef hrt einzupacken
9375785 sag mal kleines wann hast du eigentlich geburtstag oder gibts es so was bei euch nicht

9375798 sorry ich wollte dich nicht raus bringen aber du bist gerade ganz alleine gefahren
9375799 nun m ssen wir nur noch das schalten lernen denn sonst f hrst immer nur im gleichen gang
9375800 du hast doch auf deinem lenker links und rechts so hebel
9375801 siehste genau die nimmst du her damit du langsamer oder schneller fahren kannst ohne schneller oder langsamer zu treten
9375802 rechter hebel ist die kleine einteilung und links die gro e
9375803 das war wohl ein paar g nge zuviel du musst einen klick nach dem anderen schalten sonst wird die bersetzung zu schwer
9375804 so jetzt brauchen wir nur noch ein paar tage ben und dann
9375805 kann ich nun alleine weiter radeln du wei t warum
9375806 ich will ja deinem gl ck nicht im wege stehen
9375807 er hat auch nichts hinterlassen wo er ist und wann er wieder kommt
9375808 nun sei mal nicht traurig er ist bestimmt morgen wieder da
9375809 ich denke schon wo will er denn hin hier ist doch sein zuhause
9375810 nichts ist los oder besser gesagt gar nichts ist los du kannst heute nicht nach pilu schauen
9375811 schau mal raus oder willst du bei dem wetter losradeln du bist ja weggeschwemmt bis du drei hundert meter gefahren bist
9375812 na gut das seh ich ein ach darum wolltest du mich ein bisschen verw hnen ist aber nett von dir
9375813 lass uns erst mal nach hause fahren dann sag ich es dir
9375814 eigentlich schon da etwas tiefere wasserpf tzen f r dich ja schon ausgewachsene seen sind aber na gut wenn du mir versprichst dass du solche hindernisse konsequent umf hrst dann darfst du los
9375815 die strasse ist ziemlich befahren wird wohl besser sein du nimmst mal wieder in meiner hosentasche platz
9375816 wei t du eigentlich warum ich gerade dich ausgesucht habe um mal die menschen etwas n her kennen zu lernen
9375817 nein keine ahnung vielleicht weil ich so gutm tig bin
9375818 du warst der sch nste mann der bis dahin auf diesem weg vorbei kam
9375819 jetzt mach aber mal einen punkt so ein bl dsinn ich und der sch nste mann da gibt es ganz andere
9375820 nein wirklich f r mich warst und bist du es punkt gut ich gebe zu es war nicht der einzige punkt sondern da wir gnome die gabe haben in die herzen der menschen zu schauen
9375821 h r blos auf du hast doch was vor wenn du mir derart viel honig um den mund
9375822 hemm zugegeben ich m chte von dir was besser gesagt ich m chte dich um was bitten
9375823 was war es nun um was zu mich bitten wolltest
9375824 ach ich wei nicht wie ich das sagen soll du wei t doch das ich neulich alleine bei pilu war
9375825 m chte aber bei dir bleiben und trotzdem pilu nicht verlieren nun hab ich mir gedacht ob es nicht m glich w re
9375826 nun ja ob nicht pilu und ich bei dir bleiben k nnten so nun ist es raus
9375827 interessanter vorschlag glaubst du das k nnte funktionieren w rde mich ja ehrlich gesagt freuen denn ich hatte schon so eine ahnung das ich dich vielleicht an pilu verlieren k nnte nur ob pilu da mitspielt
9375828 um den brauchst du dir keine sorgen zu machen um den k mmere ich mich schon dass er mitmacht
9375829 du musst jetzt aber nicht ganz ausflippen ich freu mich ja auch das du bei mir bleiben willst
9375830 nein warum sollte ich berleg nur gerade wie das mit dem schlafplatz f r euch werden soll noch ein bettchen oder ein neues gr eres f r euch beide
9375831 sag mal du unterh ltst dich doch mit dem eichh rnchen wieso darf ich davon nichts h ren
9375832 ganz einfach weil dieses gespr ch nicht f r menschliche ohren bestimmt ist
9375833 gerne aber nicht jetzt da ich wie du anscheinend bemerkt hast immer noch bei der unterhaltung bin also bitte st r uns nicht weiter
9375834 also gut ich versuch es mal dir zu erkl ren du siehst doch den schatten dort auf dem tisch
9375835 wenn dieser schatten bis zur fensterbank gewandert ist dann ist es kurz vor sieben
9375836 die menschen haben schon lange bevor es richtige uhren gab die zeit an hand der konstellation der sonne und mittels eines stabes im richtigen winkel angebracht die uhrzeit bzw tageszeit ablesen k nnen
9375837 und was ist mit diesem tick tack an der wand
9375838 das ist ein perpentikel eine pendeluhr mit gewichten zum aufziehen
9375839 wenn ich mal mehr zeit habe erkl re ich dir die uhr einverstanden
9375840 gut ich schau jetzt auf den schatten und wenn er auf der fensterbank sitzt dann sag ich dir bescheid
9375841 w re nett von dir dann kommen wir wenigstensnicht zu sp t
9375842 warum ich muss zuh ren ist auch nicht einfach kann ja meine ohren nicht zusperren
9375843 ja und ich muss es tausend mal spielen damit du was zum lachen hast oder wie
9375844 nein es gef llt mir immer wieder die gleiche melodie zu h ren
9375845 h r mal kleine maus du k nntest doch schon mal den tisch decken
9375846 ist ja schon gut also nochmal liebe wichtline w rst du so nett
9375847 sono dispiaciuto per i ragazzi che hanno corso tanto si sono impegnati creando parecchio e giocando un buon calcio semmai avremmo dovuto essere pi cinici nel nostro momento migliore poi vero che ci sono stati tanti errori ad esempio il secondo gol dove abbiamo perso la palla in uscita
9375848 cossu aveva giocato bene ma era stanco e volevo inserire lazzari poi c stato linfortunio di pisano avevo anche chiamato acquafresca ma ho dovuto rinunciare dopo lepisodio del rigore con 35 gradi e con tutto quello che avevamo speso con un uomo in meno sottoritmo andare a prendere la palla era difficile ci siamo anche innervositi e sono venuti fuori gli errori
9375849 pi brava a gestire i momenti duri tenere pi lordine a volte occorre mettersi allangolo e prendere meno botte possibile certamente gli errori ci stanno e fanno parte dellimponderabile se sapessimo gi come andava a finire non andremmo nemmeno in panchina
9375850 aveva fatto un ottimo pre campionato come tutti in quanto a caratteristiche si avvicina ad acquafresca mentre matri pi simile a jeda ho sei attaccanti a disposizione di volta in volta sceglier chi mandare in campo
9375851 prima dellepisodio del rigore eravamo padroni del campo aspettavamo il raddoppio da un momento allaltro dopo abbiamo pagato a caro prezzo linferiorit numerica
9375852 avevamo messo alle corde una grande squadra come la lazio
9375853 la difesa ha perso la sua organizzazione ed andata come andata il rigore ingiusto si visto che diego stava calciando scivolato e la palla gli carambolata sul braccio dispiace perch potevamo tornare con un punto invece siamo rimasti a bocca asciutta
9375854 uno sente 4 1 e chiss cosa pu pensare invece hanno segnato quattro gol su altrettanti episodi nel primo tempo avevamo giocato benissimo fatto un gol e preso un palo lespulsione ci ha tagliato le gambe in dieci contro undici la partita cambiata se eravamo stanchi no direi piuttosto un po di tensione era la prima partita e pu capitare
9375855 sono entrato e abbiamo preso il terzo gol la lazio una squadra bene organizzata ci ha messo in difficolt quando rimasta con un uomo in pi lespulsione ingiusta
9375856 per quel che ho visto in allenamento il gruppo motivato e ha tanta voglia di fare
9375857 the private sector is where most of the talent to do that work resides and the war is emblematic of that trend
9375858 when the war begins to wind down and a withdrawal takes place you will see a reduction in spending on that work because that work wont exist anymore
9375859 theyre expecting those supplemental appropriation bills to be reduced or maybe go away over the next three or four years
9375860 and because of that defense spending is going to flatten out thats going to cause some challenges
9375861 i dont know if you have a category for the quickest shrinking company but maybe well be there in a couple of years
9375862 we hopefully would be selling stuff for medical and police applications by then
9375863 what youll likely see is a lot of those funds moving over to other pent up needs within the defense department and to other agencies whose needs have gone unmet
9375864 some individual companies may feel the effect more than others
9375865 maybe the democrats would say were not going to buy anymore weapons because were going to invest in health and human services so whoever has that weapons system would get hurt worse than me whos just doing the engineering work
9375866 it will not impact us because one of the mainstays of military operation and one of the most fundamental of all requirements is communication
9375867 we chose communications because we knew it has broad applicability everybody in the world needs to communicate
9375868 when i was trying to contact you cause things went a bit south i managed to find your address and phone number has anybody ever contacted you about that
9375869 shes either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
9375870 even the bush administration cant deny the reality of global warming
9375871 the governor is aligning herself and the state of alaska with the most discredited fringe extreme viewpoints by denying this
9375872 lascia perdere non sono cose che si fanno non vi siete conosciute nel pi felice dei modi non potrete mai essere amiche
9375873 s que los torneos en todo el mundo est n aumentando cada vez m s los premios obviamente estamos muy felices del lugar alcanzado por el tenis en los ltimos 40 a os eso es algo muy bueno
9375874 pero creo que los grandes torneos deber an repartir sus ganancias un poco m s con los jugadores veremos c mo sigue el tema
9375875 sin dudas deberemos conversar la cuesti n el pr ximo a o o los siguientes como lo hacemos habitualmente
9375876 sure we can go for an hour on the elliptical at level 14
9375877 the searches were led by the ramsey county sheriffs office deputies coordinated searches with the minneapolis and st paul police departments and the federal bureau of investigation
9375878 the battle for wine and love or how i saved the world from parkerization
9375879 if mccain wanted a former beauty queen with no experience and a criminal investigation on her record why didnt he just pick his own wife
9375880 do you really need encouragement just to answer the question
9375881 senator mccain there will be time to discuss your financial policies later im asking about your vp selection
9375882 listen let me put it to you this way the people who come from this place they must call themselves something whats the word they use to refer to themselves
9375883 good i suppose you wouldnt mind sharing it with me then
9375884 so senator is it true you picked gov palin as a pandering move to women voters
9375885 vell i vas goinik to nuke the united states but i dont vish to be seen az beingk mean to the vpilf
9375886 just let him try and call me a cunt just let em ill show him a cunt ill cut him off at the motherfucking knees
9375887 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
9375888 when the ana afghan army and coalition troops got close to the village firing started after the ana unit stopped and the coalition forces conducted the operation in the village
9375889 i dont know how much were going to sell them for now but the price is going to have to go up
9375890 weve been out of food since yesterday the people outside are screaming
9375891 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
9375892 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
9375893 i think im getting the hang of it but its still a tough nut to crack
9375894 i dont know if he can put his mind at rest poor guy at the moment its up to him i was sorry to see a great champion like him be out of the top ten at valencia
9375895 but with regards to ferrari he can put his mind at rest
9375896 it cant be forgotten that hes the world champion and that last year he won in his first season with ferrari while many people never thought he would do so now he has 17 victories and i hope hell get back to winning ways in the next grand prix in belgium anyway hes not a driver in crisis

9375912 deciding to cut the second meal was the most painful and heated discussion i remember among board members
9375913 its not a wing on a museum or something its a person waiting for a meal that doesnt come
9375914 this is the worst weve experienced in my 16 years here

9375924 there was substantial evidence of drug smuggling through the war zones on the part of individual contras contra suppliers contra pilots mercenaries who worked with the contras and contra supporters throughout the region u s officials involved in central america failed to address the drug issue for fear of jeopardizing the war efforts against nicaragua in each case one or another agency of the u s government had information regarding the involvement either while it was occurring or immediately thereafter senior u s policy makers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the contras funding problems
9375925 the cia and crack evidence is lacking of alleged plot

9375970 say did i mention that my wife just doesnt understand me shes such a cunt no
9375971 what if there are no more piggy banks from which to steal
9375972 there are incredible signs of economic thin ice almost anywhere you turn today in the united states the national debt has never been higher consumer debt has never been higher savings have never been lower the trade deficit has never been higher the dollar is spectacularly weak foreclosures are mushrooming higher quality jobs are disappearing in droves people are working longer to maintain the same standard of living or often less employers are economizing among other ways by cutting healthcare benefits real estate values are plummeting sure its a great time to be a bankruptcy lawyer or a repo man but probably most of us would agree that keeping people in those two fields well employed isnt worth the trade off of having an economy in the toilet
9375973 theres been an undeniable dark side to the phenomenal success of the american economy
9375974 we stole from indentured servants from the beginning we stole from native americans within minutes of landing here and never stopped until wed grabbed all the land and resources we wanted leaving them casinos and poverty in return we harnessed yokes around africans and imported them as if they were agricultural beasts of burden and continued to do so for centuries we built our economic accomplishments on the backs of near slave immigrant laborers from chinese coolies to mexican wetbacks along with irish italian german jewish and a whole lot of other nationalities in between we stole fully half of mexico following a trumped up war no less bogus than the current one in iraq then we did the same for hawaii cuba the philippines and more we broke the backs of labor movements in order to enrich a few owners while grinding human resources into impoverishment and early death we exploited the entire continent and a half of latin america installing local dictators in country after country who got personally wealthy by doing the oppressive and murderous dirty work for american resource extraction corporations we assigned to women endless domestic chores without the slightest compensation nor political power nor even ownership of family wealth these are the obvious thefts and there is no more accurate word for it
9375975 there are less obvious ones as well we have raped the environment for precisely the same purposes you can get a lot wealthier a lot faster by not concerning yourself or even paying compensation for the environmental destruction caused by manufacturing mining drilling and more than you would by having to be responsible for those very real costs of your enterprise economists like to gently refer to such factors as externalities thats a polite way to describe a process by which the rich get even richer through offloading the costs of their business to you and me and keeping the profits for themselves
9375976 new and improved more subtle forms of national wealth theft rampant consumerism based on little plastic cards is quite effective leaving costs to others like our children so is as exhausted consumerism now heads for the ditch turning our houses into piggy banks to keep an economy artificially afloat until that can no longer be sustained either or running incredible trade deficits or radically deflating the value of our currency to keep sales of american goods abroad halfway viable another nice trick you can do is run up the national debt and leave that to your kids as well you can also ignore your infrastructural repair and development needs so people can party on now instead of paying the taxes necessary to keep the economy strong for the next generation talk about eating your young one of the best of all these games over last decades has been the uninhibited agenda of economic globalization which has now managed to successfully export american white collar jobs to india right behind the blue collar ones that previously went to china that was supposed to make us all richer remember some people indeed are those without jobs or working for half what they used to make arent in that small group however
9375977 americans have not felt such economic insecurity since the great depression
9375978 got really rich by stealing the extra wealth whether from someone elses labor from their neighbors from the environment in which we live or from the future
9375979 do we really want to put this woman one heartbeat away from the presidency
9375980 she is so inexperienced what if something happens to mccain

9375984 given the move to single embryo transfer and therefore the importance of patients having access to 3 full cycles of treatment i would urge pcts across england to look carefully as quickly as possible at this new policy look at how it was achieved work with infertility network uk and ensure that all patients finally receive the treatment they are entitled to

9376026 alan met with dr james andrews yesterday and after a complete hands on exam and review of mri x ray pictures he did a successful scope on alans shoulder he said there was a partial tear of the rotator cuff that he cleaned up along with some fray but was very specific that it was not considered a typical repair where you actually have to tie anything down also there was some fray along the labrum which he cleaned up saying that because nothing was considered a complete repair that alans recovery should go well dr andrews went on to say that the issues going on with alans shoulder this year would surely prohibit his arm from working the way it can and should but that this will put him back on track
9376027 was very specific that it was not considered a typical repair where you actually have to tie anything down

9376082 more than 3 500 insurgents have been taken off the streets of baghdad by the elite british force in a series of audacious black ops over the past two years
9376083 they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think exceptional savvy i cant say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet
9376084 the u s military is conducting a propaganda campaign to magnify the role of the leader of al qaeda in iraq according to internal military documents and officers familiar with the program the effort has raised his profile in a way that some military intelligence officials believe may have overstated his importance and helped the bush administration tie the war to the organization responsible for the sept 11 2001 attacks
9376085 for the past two years u s military leaders have been using iraqi media and other outlets in baghdad to publicize zarqawis role in the insurgency the documents explicitly list the u s home audience as one of the targets of a broader propaganda campaign
9376086 disinformation and war propaganda are an integral part of military planning what the washington post fails to mention however is its own role in sustaining the zarqawi legend along with network tv most of the printed press and of course cnn and fox news not to mention a significant portion of the alternative media
9376087 by 1969 the sas had been sent to northern ireland to perform covert operations against the ira which included assassination
9376088 perhaps the best known incident that involved the sas in a wet operation was the assassination of an ira unit in gibraltar
9376089 in new york he attended a meeting with fbi agents and british intelligence officers there he agreed to expose ira operatives in america to the fbi however the same terrorists who were arrested months later were first allowed to procure and send the infrared technology to the ira fulton claims this technology was used in the troubles and forms the basis for insurgent bombs in iraq
9376090 iraqi security officials on september 19 2005 variously accused the two britons they detained of shooting at iraqi forces or trying to plant explosives
9376091 the next time you read or hear about crazed al qaeda in iraq terrorists blowing up children or desperate job applicants keep in mind according to the iraqi interior ministry the perpetrators may very well be british sas goons who cut their teeth killing irish citizens
9376092 u s and saigon intel services maintained an active list of vc cadre marked for assassination
9376093 we are fully prepared to respond to the emergency situation
9376094 we have activated our emergency operations center as well as our reception center
9376095 they will walk through the scanner and it automatically loads into the computers we have a list of where they need to go
9376096 with hurricane katrina we had no system families were calling wanting to know where family members were and we had no way of finding out this way we have a better way of tracking where people are going
9376097 we could go to new orleans or it could be port arthur
9376098 until then we are going to try to help these people
9376099 today we had plenty of water and it only took us about four hours to get here
9376100 it wasnt bad at all i knew it would be different this time
9376101 there are things we are doing in anticipation and preparation with katrina the storm hit and we walked outside and there were 45 buses we learned a lot about what not to do from three years ago
9376102 traffic will be very congested because there are a great number of self evacuees coming up the highway
9376103 i just advise citizens to bear with it because their fellow texans are trying to get out of harms way
9376104 most of the soldiers who had served in either the gulf or afghanistan were suffering from post traumatic stress little support or counselling was available on discharge from the forces
9376105 virtually all became involved in heavy drinking or drug taking and in consequence involvement in violence offences sometimes domestically related happened routinely
9376106 the vast majority of the offending is drug or alcohol related violence there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling
9376107 had support services been available at the point of discharge and when personnel first came in touch with the criminal justice system custody could have been avoided probably in the majority of cases
9376108 a select few get into a vortex that drags them downwards
9376109 we believe more effort should be made to tackle the acceptance of heavy drinking that still occurs among sections of the armed forces to identify causes for alcohol misuse to help vulnerable personnel reduce their alcohol intake and to investigate the long term psychological health effects of alcohol over use among service personnel
9376110 the majority of people that leave the armed forces leave having had a life changing experience
9376111 some do find it difficult to adjust and feel isolated and lonely in some cases people will descend into alcohol or substance abuse lose their job and spiral into homelessness and eventually end up in jail military operations in recent years have placed the armed forces under increased pressures
9376112 robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd and other stress disorders counselling is available to service personnel at all times and all troops receive pre and post deployment briefings to help recognise the signs of stress disorders
9376113 thats when i started to drink heavily everybody did it it was the norm

9376116 the hurricanes going to hit new orleans about the time they start chuckle the timing is at least it appears now that itll be there monday that just demonstrates that gods on our side laughter everythings cool
9376117 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9376118 there are racers who throw in the towel pretty quick without broken arms with just a head cold
9376119 i think about whether that person who i select would be most prepared to take my place and that would be the key criteria
9376120 t he first and really major and overwhelming priority is a person who shares my principles my values my priorities as you know priorities are very important in presidents and could be immediately take my place thats i think the overriding criteria
9376121 it is who can best take my place and carry on the agenda and the vision that i have outlined and will continue to outline during this campaign
9376122 someone who shares my priorities and my principles and also obviously who is ready to take my place at a moments you know immediately
9376123 lieutenant grasven convey to the rest of the party that i have finally located the mothership
9376124 when it seems that hopefulness is the least appropriate response in this situation let it rise up even more whisper your hope when you lie down at night scream your hope when you wake in the morning live your hope as if it is the one and only thing that sustains you in this ravaged world you will not be disappointed

9376137 general tire and lucas oil are the proud television sponsors of the 2008 mint 400
9376138 my life is pretty much devoted to wheeling i am either running my company or out fixing my rig or wheeling it somewhere around the country of course every now and again i have to sneek down to the tropics and spend a few weeks scuba diving as i love that as much as wheeling but could not figure out a way to make a living from being a beach bum lol
9376139 ah yes music the sound of the soul my taste run pretty wide i have had the time of my life at a madona concert rocking out in the front row and am equally at home in the mosh pit at a social distortion concert i am partiall to the 80s music since those were my teen years and well we all know about those times i can always turn up the volume to the classics from the 60 and 70s because lets get real what would todays music be with out the likes of hendrix zepplin or the stones when ever my dog dies my women leaves me or my truck breaks down i gotta revert back to my roots and go country cause lets face it folks only one way to mend an achy breaky heart rap hip hop and the like well ok so i think i am a studio gangsta ok that was silly but hey everybody cant be a brotha more on the music thing later

9376143 the kids are getting into it because they heard something about it being dangerous and exciting and lets try something new to get attention
9376144 senator obama and i fought a hard battle a lifetime ago that is over ancient history the race for the presidency is between two no four individuals i campaigned hard for senator obama through september and then respectfully yielded the stage
9376145 during my reflections i compared and contrasted senators obama and mccain their personal histories temperaments the type of people they surround themselves with
9376146 i did not know where my deliberations would lead me but i did reach a conclusion to be fully open i wasnt comfortable with it at first i threw away every scrap of paper and started again days i toiled i arrived at the same conclusion
9376147 today i stand before you and declare without a care for the political recrimination that may be hurled at me that i can no longer support the candidacy of senator obama for the office of the presidency of the united states i hereby pledge my full support to senator mccain and governor palin and will do whatever they ask in support of them
9376148 a wish to look like somebody else and make it happen can be seen as a mental disorder

9376151 an islamic regime must be serious in every field there are no jokes in islam there is no humor in islam there is no fun in islam
9376152 i respected his mandate i respected his age and the courageous decision that he took to come into government
9376153 ian paisley and i would tell each other stories about the people who approached us after making the deal
9376154 he told me about coming off a plane at heathrow and this woman came over and said mr paisley can i shake your hand and he said yes and they shook hands then she said that a couple of months earlier she wouldnt have shaken his hand she would probably have slapped him on the face and it turned out she was the mother superior of a nunnery but she praised him to high heaven and said he had done a good thing and she wanted to say thanks
9376155 i told him about being in the city hotel in derry and this woman came running up to me and said can i give you a big hug
9376156 i think that tells you how things have changed and that something very very powerful has happened and its not just on this island
9376157 in all the times ive travelled to london since 1994 everybody that comes up to me tells me to keep up the good work i havent heard one angry voice which is absolutely amazing
9376158 i meet people all the time who have been hurt by the ira
9376159 some of the most humbling moments are meeting those people and they put out their hands and say well done this is good keep it going
9376160 those people think that more car bombing more military activity is going to bring about the freedom of ireland but theyre living in cloud cuckoo land
9376161 they need to recognise and understand that were in a new situation and that there cannot be under any circumstances whatever any contemplation of going back to the bad old days people should assist in the apprehension of those who are involved in these deeds
9376162 my message is that it is a totally futile exercise that runs totally contrary to what the people of ireland as a whole want
9376163 any attempt to plunge us back into the violent days is not going to be supported do they really want to see 20 000 or 30 000 soldiers back on the streets
9376164 its just wall to wall meetings from morning to night
9376165 all we can do is offer our experiences i tell them that without decisive leadership it is almost impossible to resolve conflict we have no delusions of grandeur about our abilities to resolve those conflicts but if it saves lives why not negotiate now
9376166 we have to recognise that in the final analysis we got it done
9376167 it was a remarkable act of leadership by adams and mcguinness to talk the ira into peace and to persuade them to settle for something far less than they had demanded in 1993
9376168 more human though we suspected he had more first hand operational experience
9376169 i have entered into the relationship with peter robinson with a commitment and dedication to make it work
9376170 i think its fair to say there have been difficulties but my assessment is why would he not want it to work its still early days in the leadership of peter robinson but im working on the basis that he wants this to succeed im optimistic
9376171 i suppose that has been a feature of the process from the very beginning people are impatient for change and i think rightly so
9376172 nobody could say with their hand on their heart that at this stage the institutions have delivered everything that people want but i think what they want to know is are they beginning to deliver and is the potential there for delivery
9376173 all of this is worth nothing if it doesnt make a difference a real difference
9376174 a rubicon has been crossed by everybody and the project for me now is to ensure that there can be no going back this is the only sane and sensible way forward for all of us
9376175 this is the best way to break down the old hatreds and divisions
9376176 compromises have had to be made compromise is a dirty word in the course of irish politics but people recognise that they had to be made
9376177 ill tell you what ive learnt ive learnt that nothing is impossible that no matter how things are if theres a will to find a way through then a way will be found
9376178 it was a bit like watching your children graduate from college
9376179 compromises have had to be made compromise is a dirty word in the course of irish politics but people recognise that they had to be made
9376180 ill tell you what ive learnt ive learnt that nothing is impossible that no matter how things are if theres a will to find a way through then a way will be found
9376181 it was a bit like watching your children graduate from college
9376182 why dont you pick up a shovel and make yourself useful
9376183 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
9376184 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
9376185 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
9376186 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
9376187 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
9376188 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
9376189 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
9376190 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
9376191 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
9376192 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
9376193 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
9376194 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
9376195 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
9376196 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
9376197 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
9376198 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

9376210 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
9376211 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
9376212 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
9376213 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world
9376214 the constitution is the guide which i never will abandon

9376257 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse
9376258 of course already the blogosphere is abuzz with speculation that palin was chosen because she is a woman and maybe this is true but it is not the reason i will be pulling for her and mccain come november for me sarah palin represents many right leaning libertarian ideas that i personally support low taxes gun rights and smaller government
9376259 palin too complements mccain hes old and crusty shes young and hot he is still distrusted by social conservatives shes a social con darling hes been in the senate about as long as joe biden shes a newish governor several thousand miles away
9376260 it was a bold choice that could be a game changer for john mccain sarah palin 44 seems to be both an economic and a social conservative who can appeal to whatever remains of the libertarian wing of the gop and did you notice that shes a woman and something of a sporty babe
9376261 i was shocked to hear that mccain picked palin who is closer to ron paul on policy issues than to john mccain
9376262 sarah palin had been involved in various ways with the alaska libertarian party from 2004 2006 culminating in an endorsement from that party for her 2006 gubanatorial campaign well that isnt her only involvement in the third party scene apparently palin also recently sent a recorded video message to the alaskan independence party at their 2008 convention it should be noted that palin was on steve forbes leadership committee for alaska in 2000
9376263 from what little of palin i know thus far she seems to be about as good a pick from a major party as libertarians could hope for
9376264 like most americans i have been trying to figure out the implications of john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate who the heck is this woman will her presence on the gop ticket help or hurt mccain bob barr and barack obama is she as rumored sorta kinda libertarian leaning
9376265 we are just seeing a lot more categories 4 and 5 globally than we have ever seen

9376267 and since gustav is a very strong storm youd expect gustav to have had an effect from human induced global warming
9376268 but the dominant effect in my mind is just bad luck
9376269 if we take another hit like katrina i dont think there is any way we could rebuild again

9376293 ive long been interested in archaeology and was an anthropology major in college like almost everyone else i know im fascinated by egyptian mummies and had been corresponding with an egyptologist who arranges ct scans on mummies i thought what if one of those scans reveals a shocking surprise this story allowed me to explore some of the creepiest preservation rituals known to archaeologists from mummies to shrunken heads to bog bodies
9376294 to everyones horror a bullet is found in the leg evidence that the ancient mummy is in fact a modern murder victim and shes not the only victim whos been hidden in the museum for years a killer has been collecting women and preserving them using ancient techniques that indicate may be an archaeologist and hes started a gruesome collection all his own

9376302 the 21st century has started out as a bad acid flashback of the 12th we should be asking why people who believe speak out in defense of faith how good how wonderful it is the new atheists look at their truth claims and find them ridiculous look at their actions and find them hideous and cant figure out why anyone would believe or even accept belief in others it would seem on the face of it that figuring out why people believe would be our number one academic industry and our number one national security priority but there is no meaningful dialogue about it thats why i wrote the book and even though its a thriller and a murder mystery and a detective story with chases and shoot outs and some sexy stuff thats what its really about
9376303 a rare thriller with a daring original plot and rich fascinatingly oddball characters that leaves you bound and helpless against the need to turn the page great stuff
9376304 the fresco is both scary and beautiful in its violent graphic depictions it achieves an impression on the viewer that is both repugnant and holy this apparent juxtaposition of values was fascinating for me and it sparked within me an exploration of the concept of gods presence in suffering in art in beauty and ugliness in life and in eternity
9376305 i think that the mysterious ability to depict truth and beauty and pain and life all on a blank slate is fascinating because im not an artist i wonder what kind of lucid insanity it really takes to see a picture in your head and then translate that into an image that can be seen by others there is a sense of the supernatural in that for me and i find that supernatural spark to be irresistible
9376306 that publishing is less about talent and more about celebrity this cracks me up but its the nature of the career ive chosen to pursue so its not worth crying over but it does make me laugh sometimes
9376307 ive never met a heroine who is a true renegade none of the female lead characters break the rules in the way that jack reacher or joe pike do so i decided to create a maverick heroine to operate in this dangerous and lawless country
9376308 how very easy it would be in a country with a crime rate as high as ours like hiding a tree in the forest to make a targeted crime appear random
9376309 johannesburg is a great place for a crime writer to live
9376310 theres really no excuse for writers block just turn on the radio and listen to the daily news and youll have enough ideas for ten books
9376311 the people are incredibly friendly the climate is awesome its a great holiday destination and id like to encourage everyone to include south africa in their travel plans
9376312 likely to be the most successful campaign in terms of promoting crime and thriller writing that there has ever been

9376317 legacies of the resistance are to be seen at all levels in modern french literature

9376327 the uk economy has grown for well over 10 years it is resilient much more resilient than it was the current period no matter how difficult is an awful lot better than the early 1990s when more than 3 million people were out of work interest rates and mortgage rates were much higher and we had higher levels of debt we as a country are better placed now than we have been in the past
9376328 the obama campaign has appeared to use coded language that refers disparagingly to mccains age
9376329 stretch from the mccain campaign into the murky corners of talk radio the internet and shadowy groups willing to use any outlandish smear
9376330 we are in the hunt for the white house barack obama is going to have to step up with more than a smart tongue snappy words and a nice suit
9376331 democrats have been helped by 527 groups too though obama has tried to clamp down on their activities but republicans have found them to be highly effective
9376332 a former radical with the weather underground organisation which planted bombs in the 1960s
9376333 hideous hermaphroditical character which has neither the force and firmness of a man nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman
9376334 murder robbert rape adultery and incest will all be openly taught and practiced
9376335 may almight y god forgive her murderers as i know she forgave them but i never can
9376336 republicans turned defeat into victory for rutherford hayes by counting democratic votes as their own in three southern states both parties used violence to intimidate former black slaves for their votes and not to mention that republicans extorted 2 of the salaries of federal employees to aid in their campaign efforts or that democrats accused hayes of shooting his mother and robbing the dead or that republicans claimed that samuel tilden suffered from venereal disease
9376337 although popularly identified with black clad teenagers and rock musicians the gothic has also been an important theme in contemporary fashion
9376338 the imagery of death and decay the power of horror and the erotic macabre are perversely attractive to many designers for example john galliano told me that he saw the gothic girl as edgy and cool vampy and mysterious while the most recent rodarte collection was inspired by japanese horror films
9376339 there have been many studies of the gothic in art architecture literature and cinema but surprisingly little attention has been paid to the gothic influence on fashion
9376340 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9376341 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9376342 all of the main republican contenders back it none of their children are in it
9376343 i never saw such fear in my daughters face before and she lived through the post election violence of 1997 and 2001 when we were caught in the vortex in down town georgetown
9376344 among the critical undecideds the palin pick made only 6 percent more likely to vote for mccain and it made 31 percent less likely to vote for him
9376345 such an event dangerously threatens our religious feelings it is not appropriate to hold it during the ramadan
9376346 this is the festival of arts and culture and there are many believers in our population as well
9376347 the lack of sexual freedom has made people in the region very prone to war mongering and crimes
9376348 this is a traditional society in which most people still do not accept the existence of different sexualities or identities
9376349 we must take off our republican hat and put on our american hat
9376350 la vita non facile ci vuole sacrificio un giorno te ne accorgerai e mi dirai se ho ragione
9376351 thirty eight million people watched barack obama at the stadium in denver
9376352 what a historic night the first time an actual black person is leading the charge for a major american political party i think that says something pretty great about america we will accept a black man to lead us if the only other choice is a woman
9376353 john mccains vp pick is the governor of alaska a unknown hockey mom named sarah palin that no one ever heard of the only other job she had in politics was the mayor of a small town known as wasilla alaska and now she has the opportunity to be on a ticket opposite barack obama the first black man shes ever seen
9376354 i think this is pertinent because mccain has been running this campaign based on were at war its a dangerous world out there
9376355 the mccain people believe that americans will disregard her inexperience because they will fall in love with her story she was a runner up in the 1984 miss alaska pageant which may sound trite but you try walking in high heeled snow shoes
9376356 does she need to work out or is she pregnant
9376357 was tougher on the basketball court than the ethereal obama
9376358 she urged schools to debate creationism as well as that stuffy old evolution thing
9376359 has a beehive and sexy shoes and the day shes named she goes shopping with mccain in ohio for a cheerleader outfit for her daughter
9376360 why do men only pick women as running mates when they need a hail mary pass its a little insulting
9376361 you will not get a pass this time anyone caught looting in new orleans will go directly to the big house in the general population you will go directly to angola prison and god bless you if you go there
9376362 even in the preseason beating the raiders feels good now that the preseason games are in the books it s time for the front office and coaching staff to get to work and settle on a 53 man roster they have until 6pm et on saturday to get their cuts in so it ll be a sleepless night for them and even more so for the 22 players whose football careers hang in the balance
9376363 this is the time we have to do away with our party politics and act like americans
9376364 the whole idea is that mccain wants to appear to be presidential
9376365 hes got to appear to be putting his country first which is the slogan of his campaign that means he cant be giving a partisan speech attacking barack obama and the democrats while all this is going on
9376366 authenticity is the one word threat to the obama biden ticket
9376367 there is something going on this weekend which traditional pundits traditional consultants and traditional politicians are simply missing
9376368 in one sudden moment friday john mccain fundamentally changed american politics in a manner that transcends issues and details
9376369 the great threat to the obama biden ticket can be captured in one word authenticity
9376370 there is something unaffected and unsophisticated in the columbia princeton harvard and university of chicago meanings of the word about governor palin
9376371 by any practical standard she has done far more in the real world with much more spontaneity and practicality than barack obama
9376372 this is a moment of stunning authenticity versus a sad collapse on the part of the obama campaign from change you can count on to politics as usual as marked by obamas choice of a senator first elected when palin was 9 years old
9376373 this storm will prove to be a worst case scenario for the production region
9376374 the big question for the market is going to be how quickly after gustav passes will the industry be able to recover and get back online
9376375 they seem to actually believe that they are writing good important country music furthermore they offer sales numbers as evidence of their songs quality this strikes me as completely delusional
9376376 longtime lp enthusiasts bemoan the decline of the album artwork and liner notes and its hard not to take the point seriously especially when so many albums these days consist of a second rate photograph with a free font slapped on
9376377 i wouldnt go so far as to call gretchen wilson a one hit wonder but i cant recall ever seeing an artist crash and burn so quickly after initially showing so much commercial promise when she won female vocalist of the year i thought that shed be a force to be reckoned with for the next several years
9376378 if i had somehow purchased this thing id need a drink
9376379 this is the perfect album to put in the player and drive for about 5 hours on roads with just 2 lanes
9376380 i am loving this record but then again i am liking the new jimmy wayne record so take my opinion for what it may or many not be worth
9376381 hmmm not that i even remotely agree with the author of this review but wouldnt a so called
9376382 sugarland has done some creative things with their music and shows but i think they got a little too cute and sloppy at the same time i still like them but im hoping for a major course correction before the next album
9376383 wow something good actually came from a cmt show im stunned
9376384 sorry matt but with your remarks on joeys vocal abilities youre not even in the parking lot of the ball park on second thought your not even in town lets get real while the instrumentation might be refreshing and the lyrics nicely frivolous the highlight of this effort is her voice this women can sing and sounds very much like a pro even a good pro in my ears
9376385 whether or not this does well at radio looking at the long term miranda really needed something the polar opposite of gunpowder and lead or kerosene to balance her as an artist
9376386 im afraid i really dislike this songs lyrics its my least favorite on the album by a long way i hate the sneering attitude towards the object of the song and it feels particularly unpleasant to me since i understand irl miranda is involved in a relationship with someone who left his wife for her it affects me in a really visceral way
9376387 does josh gracin remind any of the rest of you of the actor david boreanz who played the vampire
9376388 katie cook going over to gac would be reason enough to watch cmt
9376389 great music may not always do well at radio but it always speaks for itself marketing that pigeonholes an artist may provide a
9376390 i am sick and tired of country music being a depot for failed pop stars
9376391 in 1928 kincaid published his first songbook titled my favorite mountain ballads the initial printing sold more than 100 000 copies and subsequent printings brought the sales totals to over 400 000 over the course of the next twenty years kincaid would publish a total of thirteen different songbooks
9376392 had carl smith and goldie hill been born 30 or 40 years later they might have been like faith hill and tim mcgraw the dominant married couple in country music carl smith was one of the biggest stars of the 1950s bigger perhaps than tim mcgraw is today goldie hill was glamorous and talented with a powerful and pleasing voice unquestionably one of the three or four best female voices ever in country music history
9376393 excuse me can you help me i promised a friend i would meet him an hour ago but i dont know where i am
9376394 youre in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation of 2346 feet above sea level you are at 31 degrees 14 97 minutes north latitude and 100 degrees 49 09 minutes west longitude
9376395 everything you told me is technically correct but i have no idea what to do with your information and im still lost frankly youve not been much help to me
9376396 you dont know where you are or where youre going youve risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air you made a promise that you have no idea how to keep and you expect me to solve your problem youre in exactly the same position you were in before we met but now somehow its all my fault
9376397 are you sleeping are you sleeping brother john brother john
9376398 oh give me some men who are stout hearted men who will fight for the right they adore

9376400 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9376401 which is not much different to being hit by a rock
9376402 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
9376403 we need to think about some really fundamental things that this sensory ability provides in animals
9376404 were potentially headed to one of the worst droughts weve ever had in california because of the conditions of storage the fact that were expecting very erratic weather patterns and we have much more demand than the last drought in 1993
9376405 when water is available we must be prepared to move large volumes of water during a relatively short time and then store it for use during dry periods and emergencies
9376406 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
9376407 steve agreed and then we looked at each other mutually and agreed oh what the heck well tell him who we are
9376408 he showed me his phone and sure enough there we were
9376409 i read you every day and have even when you were the north woods guys
9376410 wow that brought a surprise to both steve and i
9376411 ive worked with a few african artists and had reasonable success and since the beat came from africa we wanted to bring it back by way of combining funk with some african rhythms
9376412 im afraid i was guilty of being just above the tarzan level of understanding
9376413 and whenever we played in africa people wanted us to play all night
9376414 even in the deep bush the villages people knew about james brown
9376415 im not really all that much into black white brown
9376416 i judge each person individually and james brown was an immense personality
9376417 i was 17 and in summer school because i needed to take an english class in order to enroll
9376418 it happened to be in the fine arts building and they made the mistake of leaving me alone in the recital hall i fell in love with the sound of the instrument and that thrill has never left me
9376419 wynton kept mentioning this cat thelonious monk and we thought thats a hell of a name
9376420 from that day on i was in those practice rooms every day
9376421 i never did practice scales i was trying to play what i heard and finding new things along the way inevitably if you come at music from that process you eventually start to settle into forms
9376422 i began to think of the instrument as 88 timbred drums and then i understood
9376423 remember the sound of the pavement world turned upside down city streets unlined and empty not a soul around some lessons we learn the hard way
9376424 i often dont play it live because its hard to go back there i do it when im in a place that feels really comfortable
9376425 im on a patch of grass looking at the ocean with palm trees
9376426 the ghost of the front end of a vehicle its a feeling in the back of your neck
9376427 i would be lucky to find me a man who could love me the way that i am
9376428 theres never a moment when i go i want something to sound like that era its more creating without an end in sight i have a vision not a storyboard
9376429 and then i try to play it again and make charts
9376430 im like what someone needs to tell them im not celine dion
9376431 at some point i realized that i didnt want to sound exactly like on my albums
9376432 so i stripped down to just me on acoustic guitar with natalia on vocals
9376433 and then we started to build back up from scratch
9376434 it was a very good experience to try to rearrange the songs and see how they sounded in a simple environment
9376435 it gave me a lot of confidence a good song should be independent from arrangements if its balanced well written properly composed you should be able to arrange it with strings or play it with a rock band
9376436 i learned to select my material a lot better and be more selective with my arrangements and then when it comes to the beats since theyre djs they have a really good ear
9376437 they encouraged me to make the latin aspect more obvious
9376438 het management van arrow classic rock en adam curry hebben in goed onderling overleg besloten de ochtendshow your wake up call die werd gemaakt door adam curry en mede werd gepresenteerd door alexander stevens en eline maarsen te stoppen
9376439 it goes without saying but john is an all time great safety one of the leagues classiest professionals and his elite play speaks for itself as has been the case in other situations i would not rule anything out down the road
9376440 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique
9376441 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9376442 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9376443 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9376444 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9376445 mom those kids are laughing i think theyre laughing at me
9376446 lets just use the back door to go into school we dont have to go to the front door where those girls are
9376447 katelyn theyre probably just laughing because theyre having fun lets go
9376448 i would like to appologize to the victims of my actions wait there are none to this day i am still trying to figure out how a crime can be committed absent a victim then again totalitarian governmets tend to operate outside the laws of logic
9376449 the doctrine of non resistance against arbitrary power and oppression is absurd slavish and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind
9376450 i am to this extent carrying on the noble tradition of continuing my theological education in public
9376451 i have already talked with bob arum and he told me that oscar has agreed that the penalty will be 3 million for every pound or a fraction thereof in excess of 147 lbs during the weighin

9376455 gov sarah palin vetoed a bill thursday that sought to block the state from giving public employee benefits such as health insurance to same sex couples
9376456 john mccain has picked an unknown to run with him a 44 year old mother of five with alaskan sensibilities of the drill more for alaska bent and the women dont own our bodies god owns our own bodies bent which probably tells us all well ever find out about her there isnt much time before the election but one thing we can be fairly sure of is that she doesnt need to be vetted its highly unlikely that sarah palin is anything other than exactly what she says she is shes unlikely to have criminal connections or have some lover stowed in the back room caring for her love child id venture to guess she owes no one financial favors and so she wont have to pledge that she wont make good on any i doubt any rich guys have compromised her by seducing her with their connections and wealth she cant have been planning all along to run for national office but even so she probably didnt have to think much about keeping her background squeaky clean or secret she probably well knows that there is no such thing as a secret anyway why shes a girl
9376457 countdown to the new episodes of kids tv shows this week

9376494 ken conklin posted a commentary on an article saying that
9376495 on the one hand native hawaiians are the leading indicator of every other category worst health most incarcerated most numbers on welfare
9376496 on the other hand most hawaiians do have ohana they can team up with its very distressing it obviously ties into the depressed economy
9376497 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
9376498 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble
9376499 they both labored peacefully for the rights of their people
9376500 the best thing that could happen for hawaii both for the native and foreign population i rejoice heartily that it has come
9376501 was thought to have been directly involved in the kennedy assassinations of both john and his brother bobby
9376502 we have constant problems where we have people who are trying to repeatedly abuse our sites
9376503 the best defense of the wikipedia frankly is to point out how much bad information is available from supposedly reliable sources
9376504 in some ways were just as fallible as everyone else in some areas because our own knowledge is limited and we cant possibly fact check everything
9376505 instead of figuring out how to fix wikipedia something that cannot be done to our satisfaction
9376506 we should focus our energies on educating the wikipedia users among our colleagues
9376507 but thats the way free speech is think about the gossip world it spreads theres no way to correct it period wikipedia is not immune from that kind of maliciousness but it is relative to other features of life more easily corrected
9376508 the internet has done a lot more for truth by making things easier to discuss
9376509 transparency and sunlight are better than a single point of view that cant be questioned
9376510 we live in a universe of new media with phenomenal opportunities for worldwide communications and research but populated by volunteer vandals with poison pen intellects
9376511 three attorneys for the office of hawaiian affairs have defended a bill to give federal recognition to ethnic hawaiians comparing them to an indian tribe
9376512 why do you and other sovereignty hegemony activists always attack anyone who questions your ideas as racist vile cruel anti hawaiian etc theres plenty to question about the akaka bill sovereignty independence etc without going there just to take issue with current activists isnt racist or anti hawaiian i think that attempts to blame others for the current plight of hawaiians will ultimately hurt not help them
9376513 if you have read seen and heard his comments then you would probably realize that he has been attacking hawaiians for years by writing about him we are only defending the hawaiian people that may be unimportant to you or that may be trivial to you but to us to protect children hawaiian and non hawaiian is our number one goal if it means that we write about people like ken conklin then we will continue to do whatever it takes to protect hawaiis children this includes hawaiian children we will not stop til all hawaiis children are protected please respect that
9376514 we have plans which are confidential since we realize that ken conklin and people like ken conklin do and can check to see how we plan to protect the children of hawaii therefore we are not at liberty to describe every detail especially online
9376515 also in the future please refrain from leaving nasty comments as all ip addresses are logged and will promptly be reported to your respective internet provider mahalo

9376518 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that subject to the provisions of this act and upon issuance of the proclamation required by section 7 c of this act the state of hawaii is hereby declared to be a state of the united states of america is declared admitted into the union on an equal footing with the other states in all respects whatever and the constitution formed pursuant to the provisions of the act of the territorial legislature of hawaii entitled

9376521 ohas whole reason for existing is to provide benefits to so called native hawaiians people who have at least one drop of the blood of someone who lived in hawaii before captain cook arrived in 1778 some of ohas programs are further restricted to beneficiaries with at least 50 native blood quantum but such racial restrictions are not constitutionally permitted for a branch of the government oha will be ruled unconstitutional sooner or later in the meantime it is important to find ways to spend ohas money on programs that focus on hawaiian people and their culture but are not racially exclusionary over 160 federal and state programs provide racially exclusionary benefits to ethnic hawaiians advocates of such programs routinely make the same arguments about why the programs are legitimate thats why it is helpful to take one such program and analyze all of the reasons given for supporting it such an analysis has been done regarding a piece of healthcare legislation s1929 there were 29 false and twisted historical legal and moral arguments offered in defense of that bill and all are analyzed and refuted
9376522 oha is wrong in its defense of akaka bill cliff slater cited thomas sowell that race based programs are bad for everyone
9376523 far worse the politicizing of ethnic group disparities exacerbates interracial dissension
9376524 we are the only indigenous group in the united states without federal recognition
9376525 the future of our state is very much at stake

9376578 en materia educativa vemos el enorme rezago en materia de capacitaci n al magisterio tamaulipeco con niveles de aprovechamiento acad mico equiparables a pa ses africanos mal preparados y en algunos casos lamentablemente incompetentes
9376579 esa es la realidad de la educaci n en tamaulipas aunque tambi n debemos de reconocer los aciertos del gobierno estatal del impulso a otros programas de beneficio para quienes estudian la educaci n b sica como el programa de ingles la reforma educativa en la entidad el mejoramiento de la infraestructura educativa entre otros aspectos destacables
9376580 qued claramente establecido con el director de issstecali que no hay ninguna reforma ni mucho menos un intento de la misma y si la hubiera cualquier situaci n ser a platicada con el sindicato y con el congreso del estado
9376581 no haremos ninguna negociaci n a espaldas del trabajador y ah vamos a estar para defenderlos
9376582 se va a trabajar en 1er 2do 5to y 6to grado de primaria el pr ximo a o que entra la reforma y se va pilotear 3ero y 4to grado en un a o m s tambi n vamos a revisar los 87 programas de todos los niveles esperando que al t rmino del sexenio la reforma curricular ya est revisada

9376592 el prop sito fue de analizar acciones que impulsen la transformaci n de pr cticas pedag gicas en beneficio del proceso de aprendizaje de los alumnos de preescolar dentro de la renovaci n curricular
9376593 ellos apoyan y asesoran en todo momento a los docentes frente a grupo y les proporcionan herramientas oportunas para que puedan desempe ar su funci n con equidad y calidad

9376596 durante los ltimos 8 no han subido el presupuesto sin embargo la poblaci n s viene creciendo y eso se traduce a una carencia inminente
9376597 no se puede estar pagando siempre con terrenos que son propiedad de los ayuntamientos
9376598 el gobierno del estado tiene adeudo as como los municipios junto con todas las paraestatales
9376599 porque si un paciente se toma un medicamento pensando que no le va a hacer la misma efectividad ciertamente no le hace pero es s lo por la voluntad psicol gica ante la medicina
9376600 por lo que no estoy de acuerdo en que sea el estado el que decida en torno al aborto
9376601 mi programa de trabajo incluye devolverles a o con a o a los trabajadores el dinero que los gobiernos dan para el fondo de ahorro ah hay mucho dinero para seguir prestando el dinero que llegue al sindicato lo necesitan m s los trabajadores tambi n vamos a recuperar beneficios que ya ten amos y que han desaparecido como el apoyo para uniformes escolares y los art culos escolares para nuestros hijos
9376602 porque hasta ahora nadie hab a dicho esta boca es m a es verdaderamente grave que ni las dirigencias estatal o seccional se manifiesten contra este atropello del gobierno
9376603 que quede claro desde que publicamos nuestro desplegado combatiendo las reformas a la ley de isstecali varios irresponsables se han colgado de este tema como si fuera una bandera de campa a electoral sindical cuando en realidad issstecali s tiene problemas econ micos fuertes y concretos
9376604 mientras que nosotros queremos involucrar a todos los interesados autoridades ayuntamientos descentralizadas maestros y por supuesto a la misma instituci n
9376605 hemos recorrido una por una las oficinas de los trabajadores y saludado personalmente a miles de bur cratas que nos alientan en el prop sito de sacudir a nuestro adormilado sindicato haremos una revoluci n sindical porque hasta ahora nunca se le ha devuelto nada a nuestra gente
9376606 aliviaremos la carga econ mica de nuestros compa eros devolvi ndoles algo de lo mucho que han aportado al sindicato
9376607 ese d a se resuelve algo m s que la simple elecci n del comit ejecutivo seccional se resuelve o se complica tambi n parte del problema de issstecali porque el que resulte electo tiene que atorarle con dureza y estrategia de modo que si el o la que elijamos no sabe c mo atacar el problema de issstecali perderemos todo
9376608 pues nosotros tenemos una participaci n electoral de m s del 80 por ciento del padr n nuestros bur cratas tienen voto libre directo y secreto
9376609 nos hace un ejemplo de sindicalismo pues no cualquier sindicato u organizaci n social se da el lujo de tener tanta participaci n entre sus votantes con nosotros dijo vota el 90 por ciento de la burocracia
9376610 el voto es secreto y nadie sabr por qui n se vota
9376611 con mucho esfuerzo realizan sus estudios as como la preparaci n f sica y mental
9376612 exigiremos al gobierno del estado y al issstecali que no se est escatimando en el presupuesto
9376613 tambi n son necesarias otras 2 cl nicas en tecate y rosarito
9376614 los medicamentos se han estado sustituyendo por similares y gen ricos
9376615 les pediremos a las autoridades del issstecali que no se est sacrificando calidad a costa del dinero
9376616 costar m s aliviar a todos los que presenten complicaciones por ingerir los medicamentos de calidad dudosa liquid el funcionario
9376617 en los medicamentos m s demandados es donde hemos tenido el mayor n mero de sustituciones por parte de la instituci n
9376618 los m dicos de este hospital que est n en el paro laboral son aproximadamente 30 o 35 algunos est n operando las cirug as no se cancelaron otros est n atendiendo en urgencias es por eso que no est n todos los m dicos en la explanada
9376619 a m se me inform fue un acuerdo que se tom en el colegio m dico y la federaci n de colegios en una reuni n que hubo en el hospital ngeles
9376620 se les ha dejado en una sola rea para evitar que exista soldados o polic as en todo el hospital
9376621 desde que inici en su cargo hemos tenido una serie de problemas en los que sentimos que ha confundido su funci n como director general porque pretende actuar como patr n de los afiliados al issstecali
9376622 despu s de estar al frente del issstecali durante estos casi cinco meses act a como si fuera patr n de una empresa y entrega las cuotas de cerca de 2 mil docentes jubilados en el estado al comit ejecutivo nacional del snte
9376623 hasta que no nos den el cheque no nos vamos
9376624 me preocupa que se hayan suspendido los cr ditos para trabajadores del sete y se hayan entregado nicamente a gente del snte aun cuando se acord que no se entregar an si no hab a para ambos sindicatos
9376625 sigue firme ese trato de equidad y se lo vamos a dar de este viernes en ocho vamos a dar los pr stamos solicitados
9376626 es falso que no se les atienda acuden a las instalaciones y son atendidos en tres ocasiones los he recibido y en m ltiples veces por el equipo de trabajo a nadie se les niega la atenci n si tiene derecho a ella no se les niega la medicina que requiere a los trabajadores que tienen derecho falso que el issstecali no se les d las jubilaciones a quien cumpla con los requisitos
9376627 la ley nos obliga a jubilar de acuerdo a lo que ah se establece a cualquier trabajador que haya cotizado 30 a os de servicio el issstecali tiene un tope presupuestal que s lo le permite jubilar 200 personas en el 2008 100 trabajadores de la educaci n y 100 de la burocracia la semana pasada en la junta directiva de isssstecali se lograron 50 nuevas jubilaciones para los trabajadores de la educaci n
9376628 no est en nosotros porque issstecali no es una autoridad laboral sino a otras de la esfera del gobierno si ustedes son sete o snte si corresponden a un sindicato o no corresponden a un sindicato ese es un tema que a nosotros no corresponde ante el issstecali ustedes son trabajadores de la educaci n en la exigencia de sus derechos y as es como son tratados
9376629 no son tan eficaces a la hora de los resultados
9376630 se nos gir un oficio por parte de la direcci n general para omitir cualquier tipo de comentario
9376631 hay una mala interpretaci n por parte de las autoridades del issstecali los compa eros no vienen a tomar ninguna oficina sino a que se les atendiera como trabajadores y asegurados que son sin distinci n de siglas sindicales
9376632 al no contar con el tal n de cheque tampoco tienen derecho al servicio m dico que le fue negado a nuestro compa ero quien a m s de una semana de estar enfermo solicit atenci n en issstecali pero fue rechazado
9376633 ya la delegaci n se est organizando para eso pero hay que se alar que esto no debe suceder porque estuvo en peligro la vida de un ser humano ante la negativa de esta instituci n de salud cuando deber a de haberlo atendido de inmediato
9376634 y el caso de este profesor est desde noviembre del 2006
9376635 nosotros hacemos aportaciones de nuestro bolsillo para apoyarlo un poco con los gastos y estamos en espera de que el gobierno haga lo que le corresponde pagarle a quien est trabajando no a los aviadores
9376636 tenemos todo debidamente sustentado existen listados donde firma el maestro aviador y estos registros de asistencia los pudieran verificar muy f cilmente qui n est realmente trabajando el delgado del see como el jefe de departamento pero no lo hacen
9376637 si bien depositaron unas condiciones de trabajo a un d a que nos entregaran la toma de nota de nuestro registro pero eso no es un contrato no tiene los elementos ni las firmas ni siquiera de las partes correspondientes
9376638 pero esto tiene que salir del tribunal mientras tanto hay otras maneras de ser imparcial y deber an de atender tanto al sete cuando tenga el derecho como al snte
9376639 no somos ladrones s lo exigimos que se nos respeten nuestros derechos no nos vamos a llevar nada
9376640 no estamos secuestrando a nadie todo mundo que desee salir del edificio lo puede hacer hemos llamado a la autoridad la polic a municipal para que d fe de que no hay ning n secuestro
9376641 somos discriminados por el s lo hecho de pertenecer al sete
9376642 atendemos a m s de 2 mil personas entre jubilados pensionados por viudez por orfandad y de ascendencia nos est n quitando el dinero de todos
9376643 esto me huele mucho a pol tica es una situaci n m s o menos similar a lo que ocurri en el desfile ellos destacan su
9376644 considerar nefasta y traicionera a los intereses de los maestros
9376645 no permitiremos ninguna reforma que afecte a los jubilados y activos de la burocracia
9376646 debemos utilizar cualquier instancia y cualquier medio de lucha para impedir que se nos quiten nuestras conquistas
9376647 s estamos de acuerdo en revisar la situaci n de issstecali en buscar mejorar todo aquello que no est funcionando adecuadamente en fortalecer nuestro instituto porque nos queda claro la importancia que tiene issstecali para nosotros y nuestras familias pero de eso a que perdamos lo que ya tenemos es otra cosa no daremos ni un paso atr s
9376648 no s que sentir a l despu s de estar trabajando d a a d a durante 30 a os o m s me parece que no sabe lo que dice pues desconoce las realidades de los trabajadores se imaginan a un bombero trabajando m s de 30 a os cuando su labor lo desgasta much simo m s que a cualquier otro trabajador seguramente se le hace poca cosa trabajar m s de 30 a os
9376649 siempre estaremos dispuestos a dar la cada y buscar soluciones por medio del di logo y la conciliaci n como se ha venido demostrando a lo largo de m s de tres a os de gobierno en donde se presenta un problema all estamos porque quien nada debe nada teme
9376650 es lamentable y reprobable que el alcalde samuel ramos flores fomente que se vulneren los derechos de los ciudadanos al expresar que apoya el plant n que se realiza frente a las oficinas del issstecali y que adem s brindar la seguridad necesaria para continuar
9376651 si bien es cierto que el derecho a la libre manifestaci n de las ideas es una prerrogativa de todo ciudadano tambi n lo es el no afectar derechos de terceras personas
9376652 claro que el alcalde es el responsable de todos los bloqueos que se realicen en la ciudad incluyendo el que en pr ximos d as se realizar en el centro c vico ya que es la m xima autoridad municipal y su obligaci n es hacer respetar las leyes as como los derechos de los ciudadanos y no alentar a ese tipo de manifestaciones
9376653 de lo contrario el alcalde correr el riesgo de verse como un alcalde d bil y parcial
9376654 esto nos ayudar para que no haya desabasto de medicinas faltan reas importantes cr ticas pero acerca de esto nos sentaremos a negociar
9376655 sin embargo como sociedad no podemos permitir que grupos cualquiera que sean virtualmente estrangulen las arterias que utilizamos todos hist ricamente este tipo de acciones como la manifestada en esa vialidad generan rechazo generalizado de la comunidad y finalmente los a sla como grupo
9376656 hemos interpuesto una denuncia pero los pleitos ni ganados son buenos dios nos dio la cabeza y la boca para usarlas
9376657 l qued de presentar estos asuntos ante la junta de gobierno de issstecali pero es hora que no se hace caso a nuestro derecho de petici n
9376658 quieren una silla del sete en la junta de gobierno quieren una clave de descuento con la leyenda de sete pero eso yo no se los puedo otorgar porque no hay capacidad inform tica adem s ellos no tienen la relaci n laboral no tienen representatividad jur dica y mientras no la logren ante las autoridades laborales para lo cual tengo entendido que han interpuesto un juicio nosotros no podemos otorgarles las prerrogativas que est n exigiendo
9376659 quieren dialogar poni ndome la pistola en la cabeza as no es posible
9376660 deveras son de los actos que no haya uno c mo recompensarlos
9376661 no permitiremos ninguna reforma que afecte a los jubilados y activos de la burocracia
9376662 debemos utilizar cualquier instancia y cualquier medio de lucha para impedir que se nos quiten nuestras conquistas
9376663 s estamos de acuerdo en revisar la situaci n de issstecali en buscar mejorar todo aquello que no est funcionando adecuadamente en fortalecer nuestro instituto porque nos queda claro la importancia que tiene issstecali para nosotros y nuestras familias pero de eso a que perdamos lo que ya tenemos es otra cosa no daremos ni un paso atr s
9376664 no s que sentir a l despu s de estar trabajando d a a d a durante 30 a os o m s me parece que no sabe lo que dice pues desconoce las realidades de los trabajadores se imaginan a un bombero trabajando m s de 30 a os cuando su labor lo desgasta much simo m s que a cualquier otro trabajador seguramente se le hace poca cosa trabajar m s de 30 a os
9376665 aqu hay libertad de afiliaci n y la gran mayor a es adepto al snte y si a alg n compa ero no le satisface y deciden irse a otra instancia tampoco vamos a impedirlo
9376666 los ltimos sindicatos que se han generado es el de tabasco y de baja california los dem s son una membres a m nima
9376667 y en baja california se tendr a que hacer lo mismo en su momento con la participaci n de los sindicatos no s lo de la educaci n sino de otras instituciones de gobierno interesadas en hacer de issstecali una que garantice a los trabajadores una prestaci n social segura
9376668 porque no estamos para renunciar a lo que tenemos pero debemos ser concientes que es necesario tomar algunas decisiones que nos puedan asegurar una prestaci n de calidad
9376669 yo invitar a al sector privado que se sienten a platicar tambi n con los manifestantes porque ellos tienen derecho a atenderlos que dialoguen y vean cual es la importancia de sus peticiones
9376670 esta inversi n es sin duda una de las m s importantes en el quehacer gubernamental de la administraci n estatal porque invertir en educaci n se traduce en un beneficio directo de los ni os y adultos bajacalifornianos los que tambi n al final de cuentas constituyen la mayor riqueza y pilar para que siga engrandeci ndose baja california
9376671 es importante hacer un alto en el camino para lograr buscar distintas soluciones
9376672 la informaci n que proporcion el presidente de la comisi n respectiva en el congreso est muy lejos de la realidad
9376673 hemos busca las reuniones para encontrar soluci n a este problema pero no ha habido eco por la autoridad quienes minimizan el problema
9376674 estamos conciliando el adeudo ya hicimos un pago de m s de 7 millones de pesos con un terreno pero falta lo correspondiente a lo que se acumul durante las anteriores administraciones
9376675 cuando termine mi compromiso con el ayuntamiento espero no dejar una deuda de ese tama o y que no se deba nada a nadie
9376676 give up the idea of what life should be and just celebrate what life is

9376678 there were two men in a town one rich one poor the rich man had many sheep and cattle the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb which he raised like one of the family the ewe lamb shared the mans food drank from his cup and slept in his arms one day when the rich man had a guest to entertain he didnt want to slaughter any of his own sheep or cattle so he took the poor mans lamb killed it and prepared it as a feast for his guest
9376679 he must pay the man four times the value of the lamb because he did an unjust thing and had no compassion

9376717 we faced an approximately 750 000 campaign from our opponents including safari club international and a 400 000 state funded campaign approved by governor sarah palin and the alaska legislature they used deceptive propaganda and the authority of the alaska government to defeat the ballot initiative
9376718 from a party event to a call to the nation for action
9376719 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9376720 we have to go from a party event to a call to the nation for action action to help our fellow citizens in this time of tragedy and disaster action in the form of volunteering donations reaching out our hands and our hearts and our wallets to the people who are under such great threat from this great natural disaster
9376721 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention if necessary to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat
9376722 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9376723 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9376724 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9376725 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm
9376726 is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9376727 im assuming that where he went that wasnt an issue were going to try to stay clear of the area until things have settled down and then well probably try to figure out how we can be as helpful as possible
9376728 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9376729 were working with governors to identify and secure out of state shelter for people in the path of the storm
9376730 several states including missouri texas and new mexico are preparing to and have accepted a lot of evacuees people are leaving those areas that are of concern and were working hard to make sure that they have a place to go
9376731 in the coming days i encourage people across our nation to help their neighbors in need you can contribute to charities such as the red cross you can volunteer your time to help those in need and of course you can pray for those who might be suffering
9376732 the goal is to make sure that you take the conservative approach that were not seen to be out of touch with people who could have everything they worked for lost
9376733 id advise senator mccain to go down as is today to figure out what can i do
9376734 i think john mccains judgment is once again put at issue because hes chosen somebody who clearly does not meet the national security threshold who is not ready to be president tomorrow
9376735 i mean for heaven sakes the people who supported hillary clinton are not going to be seduced just because john mccain has picked a woman
9376736 oh i think so i think so compared to barack obama absolutely
9376737 if you are stubborn enough if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it and if you decide to stay you are on your own
9376738 anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event
9376739 the failure of the federal levees after hurricane katrina meant that we experienced devastation that we shouldnt have experienced
9376740 we dont know frankly we dont have a lot of faith in the work thats been done to repair the damage that was caused by those failures and by the storm so this time were feeling very insecure
9376741 i think that may be a bit of an exaggeration i mean they already had hurricane katrina and right now this is no hurricane katrina but we still think it will be a large and powerful hurricane and a significant threat
9376742 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9376743 ive got a bad anxious feeling in my stomach its the same feeling i had last week before the bat came

9376781 dont read the shack its evil youll lose your faith if you read it youll go to hell
9376782 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

9376803 an elective despotism was not the government we fought for
9376804 all the powers of government legislative executive judiciary result to the legislative body the concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic government it will be no alleviation that these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands and not by a single one 173 despots would surely be as oppressive as one let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic of venice
9376805 the tyranny of the legislatures is the most formidable dread at present and will be for long years that of the executive will come its turn but it will be at a remote period
9376806 repeated violations of those parchment barriers have been committed by overbearing majorities in every state in virginia i have seen the bill of rights violated in every instance where it has been opposed to a popular current
9376807 theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of government have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights they would at the same time be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions their opinions and their passions

9376809 as there is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust so there are other qualities in human nature which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence republican government that of a republic presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form were the pictures which have been drawn by the political jealousy of some among us faithful likenesses of the human character the inference would be that there is not sufficient virtue among men for self government and that nothing less than the chains of despotism can restrain them from destroying and devouring one another

9376866 supporting a family on my job at the middle eastern gaming policy corporation is difficult because i dont have the experience to move up the ladder yet
9376867 were working hard to improve our search engine rankings because this will increase our middle eastern gaming policy sales like never before
9376868 after starting an internet middle eastern gaming policy sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
9376869 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
9376870 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
9376871 because people hardly come to our stores in person anymore
9376872 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
9376873 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the middle eastern gaming policy sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
9376874 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our middle eastern gaming policy sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
9376875 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
9376876 with internet middle eastern gaming policy sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
9376877 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our middle eastern gaming policy company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
9376878 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
9376879 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
9376880 over here in the u s youve got to pay for all that back home in denmark its for free

9376884 i had no doubt they wanted to build franklin back up for a title shot
9376885 they wanted me to lose but i wasnt going in there to lose i was training hard to kick his ass
9376886 i felt it right away everything moved the wrong way it hurt and i was i screaming like a little girl it was awful right away i knew this isnt good
9376887 we only get paid when we fight its a tough business when you get injured
9376888 i wouldnt say its as good as new i think theres always going to be a little different feel to it than before but its not bothering me im training hard its just a different feel it might never be as strong as the other but as long as i can train 100 per cent im happy
9376889 i get a little bit of interest from some media but still its a very small sport back home of course theres the hardcore fans but most people dont really know much about the ufc at all
9376890 i just couldnt believe it but i had to believe what i saw happening right before my eyes
9376891 we saw a seagull sitting on what we thought was a piece of flotsam
9376892 when we got closer the seagull flew away and we saw it was a fish cal said look its a sturgeon but when we got up to it we could see it was a shark
9376893 someone might have caught the shark of the atlantic coast and kept it on ice while bringing it to norther michigan
9376894 this mysterious maniac the mad gasser haunts the night releasing a strong nauseating and paralyzing gas into the homes of his innocent ictims and they sleep he has never been identified or clearly seen the only proof he exists is a trail of blue vapor and poisonous fumes dont inhale
9376895 the audience of people that read coding horror and the audience of people that read joel on software are already fairly elite in the programmers because they are the kind of people who read things in order to better themselves as programmers and thats already you know 5 10 of practising programmers its not the vast masses of java monkeys who were formerly vb monkeys who were formerly cobol monkeys who are just doing you know large swathes of extremely boring stuff internally somewhere ahh who have i not offended
9376896 the statistics about reading are particularly discouraging the average software developer for example doesnt own a single book on the subject of his or her work and hasnt ever read one that fact is horrifying for anyone concerned about the quality of work is the field for folks like us who write books its positively tragic
9376897 i pretty much knew they would do it i just didnt know it would go down like this i was blind sided they were forcing me to make a decision in 24 hours
9376898 if i continue to go on with another team i will
9376899 if not i would be to go show the people who doubted me that i can still play
9376900 its so blatantly a political move picking a woman at all and then picking a woman with so little experience when he keeps ramming obama about his experience
9376901 with her being so unknown to be that close to taking over admit it you can imagine barack obama running a cabinet meeting its easy to envision so too can you easily picture john mccain there and joe biden makes for a comfortable image as well
9376902 the p t a is great preparation for dealing with the k g b

9376916 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9376917 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9376918 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9376919 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9376920 well get a taste in the next five days of how well she does in the 62 days that follow
9376921 seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9376922 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9376923 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9376924 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9376925 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9376926 i cant claim a bill clinton and say i never inhaled
9376927 it has really opened my eyes to international events and how war impacts everyday americans like us
9376928 we had a bad fishing year so we didnt have any money
9376929 my husband loves being a dad as much as i love being a mom
9376930 im looking at him right now and i see perfection yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9376931 i just put down the blackberrys and pick up the breast pump
9376932 having had two children at home at the age of four months i know how much help they need even without unfortunate medical conditions
9376933 i really feel mother knows best without the peanut gallery giving unsolicited advice she strongly conveys to women today that you dont have to choose between a successful career and motherhood you do have to make sacrifices but you can have it all
9376934 i would just trust that the child is not neglected in any way there are millions of women who work why is it that the father cannot provide the same standard of care there has been an evolving view of working women even in conservative christian circles
9376935 i didnt think the republicans would pick a female candidate for another decade but john mccain is not a typical conservative leader
9376936 migration is a phenomenon which has existed from the dawn of humanity
9376937 so that they continue their worthy action with a sense of responsibility and humanitarian spirit
9376938 a sense of responsibility must also be shown by the countries of origin not only because their citizens are involved but also to remove the causes of irregular migration as well as to eradicate at the roots all forms of criminality linked to it
9376939 the very grave risks they run in the search to better their conditions
9376940 the difference between new york and paris is that in paris the people smell worse than the city
9376941 we are constrained to express grave concerns over the press statement attributed to undersecretary of health mario villaverde that the department of health will now promote the nationwide use of condoms allegedly as a means to prevent the spread of hiv aids
9376942 it is the duty of the doh never to propose for general public use any prophylactic that could increase the incidence of the disease it is supposed to prevent
9376943 it is therefore irresponsible imprudent and dangerous for the department to declare that the use of the condom without any change in unhealthy sexual behavior will prevent seropositive cases from transmitting hiv aids to their seronegative spouses
9376944 we are inclined to view this as an underhanded way of subverting our strong moral and constitutional objection to the proposed legislation and confronting the nation with a fait accompli bereft of any moral or constitutional basis
9376945 we must encourage men and women to live morally upright lives and to practice marital fidelity and chastity within and outside marriage instead of telling them that risky sexual behavior is acceptable provided they wear a condom to protect them and their
9376946 around 35 percent of our hiv cases have been traced to returning ofws the infected ofw unknowingly infects his wife who in turn infects her baby once she gets pregnant
9376947 this year it is actually worse i have been here 54 years and i have never seen the water so low the situation so bad
9376948 i dont think the outside world realises just how dangerous the situation is not just for israel but for the whole region
9376949 there is a very real danger that this could lead to over salination the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
9376950 our cousins i say that because the bible says we are cousins have been drilling in areas they should not and this is diverting the water this is the politics of the middle east
9376951 they should be setting up manydesalination plants to get water from other sources theyre using israeli expertise in these matters all over the world but this is the one country which isnt using it enough i dont think it would be possible to deprive the farmers of their water so what is needed is alternative sources its that simple
9376952 quite big cracks are now appearing on the walls of our home that is due to the heat caused by the drought this is the hottest i can remember we desperately need some rain pretty soon maybe this is global warming
9376953 but the pumping out of the water doesnt help my husband was a fisherman and he has seen how the water has gone over the years and with it the fishes
9376954 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low many fishermen fear for their livelihood and so do i but it seems no one really cares about us
9376955 of course many of the disciples of jesus were fishermen at galilee if you recall he said he would make them fishers of men well that wouldnt be possible now there are hardly any fish left around here
9376956 this country has found itself through circumstances as the keeper of some of the most precious things in the world both made by man and by nature it has a responsibility to the rest of mankind to look after these things they are failing to do this here at the sea of galilee
9376957 when i told people i wanted to be a priest they were shocked and disbelieving some of them thought i should be committed
9376958 now if a youth says he wants to be a priest there is huge discouragement it is seen as a very silly career move
9376959 i was ordained 22 years ago and when i was in the seminary there were a hundred of us just for the dublin diocese
9376960 a woman in the sacristy at a wedding on saturday looked at me and said are you the parish priest
9376961 and its not going to get any easier morale can be low at times you are just working so hard and theres nobody coming behind you
9376962 we have had no candidates for the priesthood for 12 years maybe 15 no intake in that length of time
9376963 way back we had so many priests they were sent on loan to glasgow or england or america
9376964 its the secularisation of ireland the reduction in family size ireland has just caught up with the more secular europe with its more libertarian values good values around freedom and individuality and personal choice
9376965 it really bolsters you buoys you up to see that
9376966 but theres absolutely no need to be they can see it as a sort of competition theyre afraid that if they give people more power theyre going to lose power
9376967 but it isnt like that its a collaborative effort a sharing of responsibility it takes a lot of weight off the priest
9376968 for us to be able to survive we must share the workload said fr mullan
9376969 its quite threatening to the professional identity of the priest when non ordained people come into work in the parish theyre to be paid more than the clergy and perhaps in time their status will be equal to or greater than the clergy
9376970 its up to us to reorganise things and adapt to the change
9376971 we have to recognise whatever god is saying to us about combining the roles of the clergy and the laity
9376972 we have to learn from the missions system the only answer to all this is with lay involvement the co operation of the people is essential
9376973 humanly speaking you might think its going to get worse and worse
9376974 but its gods church and maybe hes putting us to the test to find other ways of stirring people
9376975 enjoy an uncritical acceptance which would never be accorded religious faith
9376976 to agree that there are objective values for which we should have serious regard because of their implications for the good of society
9376977 successive decisions in europe which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
9376978 despite what the church is saying filipino people especially the poor want family planning
9376979 they want to have control over what methods they use and they want the ability to choose without fearing a backlash from the church
9376980 life should be valued and its creation is a serious matter
9376981 couples who have the discipline to practice the church sanctioned natural family planning methods are in possession of true values of life and tend to pass it on to their children they also tend to be good citizens
9376982 if there is discipline in the marital bed then there is discipline in the streets there is discipline in schools there is discipline in the government
9376983 data shows that the poverty incidence is less than 10 percent for a family with one child compared to 57 percent for a family with nine or more children
9376984 we have a very conservative church in this country and the church still exerts a lot of influence in politics
9376985 the fact is economically we can not afford our current rate of population growth
9376986 about 5 800 babies are born daily one doesnt have to be an economist to tally how much more food water shelter medicine and other resources will be needed for their support
9376987 i will not sacrifice my principles for the sake of expediency
9376988 i will not tolerate any politician who claims to be a faithful catholic who is not genuinely pro life
9376989 no catholic politician who supports the culture of death should approach holy communion
9376990 i think it can be seriously questioned whether sen joe biden can be seen as involved in formal cooperation in abortion
9376991 formal cooperation is a technical term in catholic moral tradition and must be interpreted with great care
9376992 his voting record is clear when naral congratulates him that ends the discussion
9376993 sen biden has consistently expressed support for a womans right to choose while we have not agreed with him on every vote we have a longstanding relationship with sen biden that is open positive and constructive
9376994 he tries to wear catholicism on his sleeve when hes the poster boy of naral oh yeah were going to have a big problem with that
9376995 i think they have to be very very careful selling him as a catholic
9376996 there are elements within the church who say if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
9376997 we republicans and democrats may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9376998 there are unfortunately catholic theologians or so called theologians and even catholic priests who at times advised some of these politicians in a way that i think is very dangerous that they can be personally opposed to abortion but on their voting record they can be anything but opposed
9376999 all these bugaboos about separation of church and state are brought up which are just not true what that really means is shut up bishop shut up i have a right to speak up like any other citizen and i have a right to remind catholics thats my duty to remind catholics its not what they can do but what they should do i think thats something that they havent heard enough of and theyll hear it for me
9377000 regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia when a persons formal cooperation becomes manifest understood in the case of a catholic politician as consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws his pastor should meet with him instructing him about the churchs teaching informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the eucharist
9377001 when these precautionary measures have not had their effect or in which they were not possible
9377002 the minister of holy communion must refuse to distribute it
9377003 a catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil and so unworthy to present himself for holy communion if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidates permissive stand on abortion and or euthanasia when a catholic does not share a candidates stand in favor of abortion and or euthanasia but votes for that candidate for other reasons it is considered remote material cooperation which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons
9377004 not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia there may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia
9377005 if you had to choose between the ahi belly and the special which would you choose
9377006 the fear of violence can be a barrier to going for testing this has implications down the line and leads to a vicious cycle and interplay in which gender based violence actually drives the hiv endemic
9377007 to send out a clear message that discrimination is not to be tolerated
9377008 often the focus on children is an after thought and in that respect we have failed children however the issue of children and hiv tracked right through the main conference some of the best responses are the commonsense ones even the best orphanages cant replace parents so obviously we should be working to help parents survive often there is only one surviving parent we should be supporting the child by supporting the remaining parent the last resort is institutional care
9377009 you need to involve us you need to talk to us
9377010 we encountered a young ish priest who while extremely polite and sympathetic absolutely refused to permit any secular elements in the mass quoting liturgical correctness as the main reason while deeply unhappy we had no option but to acquiesce
9377011 enraged therefore to see that ronnie drew had a send off like no other complete with a congregational rendering of weela weela wallia and all presided over by an auxiliary bishop of dublin perhaps celebrity ensures an appropriately robed bishop as chorus master
9377012 either permitted or not to have secular elements and ones status should have no bearing on the matter
9377013 this is another example of the hypocrisy which is turning many from holy mother church
9377014 when it comes to planning funeral services some bereaved people are more equal than others it would be better if the famous and the not so famous were given similar flexibility when arranging liturgies
9377015 nothing more than to give help and guidance to the members of the christian community it is not about rules and regulations as some people have said but rather about helping people come to an understanding of christian death and to understand that when we celebrate a funeral mass we do so in the context of the life death and resurrection of jesus christ what we are doing here is in line with the diocesan guidelines and best liturgical practice we are simply reiterating what is already the ideal in terms of funeral liturgies and to emphasise again that a funeral is a sacred occasion
9377016 wished to play a more popular song such as the departed persons favourite tune they can do so after the priest has completed the ceremony of mass
9377017 like the personal songs we request that the bereaved wait until after the mass ceremony is over and then they can speak of their loved one in the church
9377018 i think its more practical for people to shake hands with the bereaved in the church than in the car park as it would only make it more difficult to bring the coffin to the hearse
9377019 requests by members of the family to speak after the prayer after communion should be firmly but sensitively refused
9377020 a brief homily based on the readings should always be given at the funeral liturgy but never any kind of eulogy
9377021 lead to unnecessary duplication of the sentiments expressed in the homily and in the prayers of the faithful
9377022 it can cause unnecessarily severe emotional stress to expect a member of the family to address the congregation immediately before the final commendation and farewell such a practice distracts sometimes seriously from the sacred nature of the liturgy and occasionally may be offensive to the congregation
9377023 other opportunities are available to acknowledge the life of the deceased for example at the graveside at the meal afterwards or in columns of the local newspapers
9377024 there is no intention other than that the family be fully involved in the funeral
9377025 the sacredness of the funeral mass is compromised by things that would be more appropriate outside the funeral liturgy such as secular songs and music eulogies and inappropriate items in the offertory procession
9377026 there is no amount of money that is going to make it right
9377027 it is more an issue of validation and in that sense they feel validated
9377028 carrying the cross with love in response to evil were at the centre of the reflections benedict xvi proposed sunday to the 8 000 people who had gathered for the angelus in the inner courtyard at the apostolic palace in cast gandolfo
9377029 if to save us the son of god had to suffer and die crucified this is certainly not part of a cruel plan by the celestial father it is due to the gravity of the illness from which he had to heal us a very serious and deadly illness that require all his blood it is in fact with his death and resurrection that jesus defeated sin and death and re established gods lordship however the struggle is not over yet
9377030 evil exists and resists in each generation even in our day and age what are the horrors of war the violence on the innocent the merciless misery and injustice of the weak but evils opposition to the kingdom of god how can we respond to so much wickedness if not with the disarming strength of love that beats hatred of life that does not fear death it is the mysterious strength that jesus used at the price of being misunderstood and abandoned by his own people
9377031 dear brothers and sisters to fully achieve the work of salvation the redeemer continues to have men and women join him and his mission in taking the cross and following him as it was for christ carrying the cross is not optional for christians but a mission to embrace out of love in the todays world where the forces that divide and destroy appear to rule christ never stops to extend his clear invitation to all those who want to be my disciples must reject their selfishness and carry the cross with me
9377032 news coverage of irregular immigration from africa shows a rise often crossing the mediterranean to the european continent seen as a place of hope where one can flee bad and often unbearable situations turns into tragedy the one that occurred just a few days ago appears to have surpassed previous ones in terms of the number of victims migration is something that has taken place since the dawn of humanitys history and has always been a feature of the relations between peoples and nations
9377033 the emergency which it has now become calls for our attention and whilst it spurs our solidarity it also requires a proper political response i know that many at the regional national and international levels are involved in finding a solution to the issue of irregular migration i applaud and encourage them so that they might continue in their worthy action responsibly and in a humanitarian spirit migrants countries of origin must also show a sense of responsibility not only because the people involved are their citizens but also because they must work to remove the causes of irregular migration as well as suppress at the roots all connected forms of criminal activity for their part european countries or at least countries of immigration must develop joint initiatives and build joint structures that are more appropriate to the needs of irregular migrants the latter must also be made aware of the value of their lives a commodity that is always precious and unique and which must be protected against the great risks incurred in trying to improve ones lot they must also be reminded of their obligation to respect the law as everyones father i feel the profound duty to call upon everyone to become aware of the problem and ask for the generous cooperation of individuals and institutions in facing it and in finding solutions may the lord accompany us and make our efforts fruitful

9377085 sarah palins mom and dad are younger than john mccain
9377086 but in norway and in saudi arabia authorities have instead focused on corralling the foreign exchange earned in the sales of energy and investing it outside their borders creating an income stream for future generations
9377087 we really felt strongly about knowing we are helping those who have given so much in serving our country
9377088 huh this is proof positive that mccain is an idiot
9377089 sarah palin huh i think you and i both know that the way things are going mccain will die in office and this lunatic will be running the show at least she is on board with the pro nuking polar bears from space platform

9377094 the new ordinance is yet another attempt to circumvent the courts prior rulings and further an agenda that runs afoul of the united states constitution
9377095 for what its worth even though the judge was wrong to comment on the replacement ordinance hes still right about it
9377096 hey senator mccain theres someone on line 2 who claims that hes the french minister of defense and hes using a makes quotation signs in the air with his fingers time machine to call you from 1939 he thinks that sarah palin is the worst choice you could have made but im not sure who he thinks you should have picked he keeps mumbling something about some maginot dude didnt we vet him back in april
9377097 on a related subject if kos wants to continue slandering sarah and their kids with this baby nonsense he had better start worrying about where todd palin is at and whether any rifles are missing from his gun rack
9377098 i havent been this unhappy since my last blow job
9377099 you are too stupid to know whats good for you
9377100 i dont like piling on political allies just because they honestly disagree

9377104 heck if you apply nro judgement to ronald reagan he would not be qualified to be president
9377105 grc im just put off by your frankly obamabot ish attitude that criticism of the alaskan one shall not be tolerated
9377106 i think its a bit creepy that apparently no one is permitted to question her foreign policy and military leadership credentials without being taken personally to task
9377107 now dont get too excited we know more about the way the world works that you rubes do and palin isnt going to work out
9377108 no such evidence of long term intellectual engagement with the issues
9377109 shut up youre not allowed to say or think bad things about sarah palin
9377110 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9377111 this is a real person living through the crises and enjoyments that people and families go through this is populist fustian america is full of real people we dont consider putting any but a handful of them on ballots for national office i will give this bees nest rest because i want gov palin to prove herself even as i want john mccain to win we have nine weeks lets go
9377112 my only point is that commander of the alaska national guard sounds defensive and lame
9377113 how dare he name someone who hasnt been on meet the press
9377114 is defending domestic violence and child abuse really the hill the left wants to die on
9377115 besides any man opposed to her is just a sucker of cock
9377116 aooogah i might get dirty my hands no you brute you brute you brute you conservative brute you drink beer
9377117 my only point is that commander of the alaska national guard sounds defensive and lame

9377119 respect squire help a poor conservative out respect me lord
9377120 stop calling sarah lame or ill sock you in your goddamn face and youll stay plastered
9377121 stop calling sarah lame you queer or ill sock you in your goddamn face and youll stay plastered
9377122 palin will also be assigned to pacify conservatives on the evidence of the numerous emails reprinted here that will be easily done reader after reader said that the base was now energized you would have thought the base was energized by being in a war if not perhaps we need a new base we have shown the same color by numbers mindset that liberals did when they rallied to obama liberals love obama because he is a numinous negro conservatives love palin because she has a downs baby and an m 16 for both sides that is all on earth ye know and all ye need to know you might call it mystical and childish
9377123 besides any man opposed to her is just a sucker of cock by choice
9377124 seems to be about as good a pick from a major party as libertarians could hope for
9377125 once upon a time bill kristol was leading a movement of new conservativism and had a great degree of freedom to say things that were not just sound bites but were meaningful and important
9377126 and the next time someone calls you a racist because you dont support the campus commie theyre running try kicking them in the balls before you explain for the 500 th time that you arent a racist try it once i guarantee you wont have to do it more than a few times and youll feel and look like a man afterwards
9377127 are there any other cultural icons that she can be painted as melanie griffith in working girl perhaps

9377129 as for brookheiser his lefty wife may have something to do with it

9377131 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9377132 do and or write about politics for living inside the beltway
9377133 my more important point was my second what the palin pick showed about us were six years into the modern thirty years war and conservatives are behaving like theyre at a yaf convention c 1967 much is excusable and even necessary in times of youth and powerlessness but we have already seen the two tallest buildings in nyc go and our first second and twentieth priorities should be to crush the serpent with our heels
9377134 and money wouldnt have come in if it had been pawlenty or romney i think the money came in because mccain picked someone people see as conservative
9377135 my more important point was my second what the palin pick showed about us were six years into the modern thirty years war and conservatives are behaving like theyre at a yaf convention c 1967 much is excusable and even necessary in times of youth and powerlessness but we have already seen the two tallest buildings in nyc go and our first second and twentieth priorities should be to crush the serpent with our heels
9377136 may i be so wrong that a hundred harpies will pluck my eyeballs
9377137 conservatives love palin because she has a downs baby and an m 16
9377138 oh my goodness muffy can you believe we nominated as vice president a woman who has shot a moose
9377139 certainly not bipsy and i am flabbergasted that she would do something like that she didnt eat it did she
9377140 mccain simply tapped into a group of people who have been on the fence at best about him pawlenty and romney would have done so as well
9377141 my more important point was my second what the palin pick showed about us were six years into the modern thirty years war and conservatives are behaving like theyre at a yaf convention c 1967 much is excusable and even necessary in times of youth and powerlessness but we have already seen the two tallest buildings in nyc go and our first second and twentieth priorities should be to crush the serpent with our heels

9377161 the last thing i need is another person telling me what they think it is
9377162 but hearing that the path leads to suffering and death he says
9377163 dont come any closer this is holy ground remove your sandals
9377164 his mission is counter intuitive how could good come from such a call liberation seems not unlikely but impossible and life threatening
9377165 god forbid it lord this must never happen to you
9377166 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me for you are setting your mind not on divine things but on human things
9377167 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
9377168 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
9377169 this is a pretty grim analysis coming from the world bank
9377170 although the overall number of people living under the poverty line has come down you still have a quarter of the developing world living on less than 2 a day
9377171 the urgency to act has never been greater the clock is ticking
9377172 especially in sub saharan africa where half the population of the continent lives in extreme poverty a figure that hasnt changed for over 25 years
9377173 if nothing is done the situation could easily become catastrophic
9377174 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
9377175 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
9377176 all eyes will now turn to the special un event looking at the global poverty goals in new york next month
9377177 heads of state business leaders and others will need to do more than to deliver fine speeches and re commit to act on tackling poverty
9377178 the wayne county prosecutors office does not use facilitators to resolve our cases
9377179 im flattered my name was mentioned but i havent heard a thing about it
9377180 it would be unique in criminal cases in civil cases it does work the percentages say it is a wise thing to do
9377181 ive handled hundreds and hundreds of criminal cases and i dont believe the words mediation or arbitration have ever been uttered
9377182 i suppose theres no reason not to try mediation but its only an option if both sides are willing to mediate
9377183 any sitting judge that hears that the mayor used the privilege of his office to negotiate a plea deal would find that conduct absolutely reprehensible and probably use it to support an increased sentence
9377184 someone in the united u s military frets over future u s russian ties
9377185 napoleon once said when asked to explain the lack of great statesmen in the world that
9377186 to get power you need to display absolute pettiness to exercise power you need to show true greatness

9377188 neem mij nee niet doen neem mij maar ik ben mooier
9377189 the question should be whether mccain and all the other republicans who have been going on for months about obamas dangerous lack of foreign policy experience ever meant a word of it and the answer is apparently not
9377190 mick so what is new episodes of kids tv shows this week

9377199 in situaties waarbij in het ontwerp niet voldoende rekening is gehouden met de mogelijkheid om ramen op eenvoudige wijze en tegen redelijke kosten te wassen de ontwikkelaar wordt veroordeeld tot het aanbrengen van voorzieningen of het aanpassen van het gebouw het uitgangspunt daarin wordt gevormd door de brancheafspraken over veilig en gezond glazenwassen dit betekent in de praktijk dat de glazenwasser hierdoor zijn werk veiliger kan uitvoeren
9377200 er wordt niet gediscussieerd over de werkmethoden de arbiters stellen dat bewoners en gebruikers van een gebouw ervan uit mogen gaan dat de beglazingen ofwel van binnenuit ofwel van buitenaf op een eenvoudige en veilige wijze en tegen redelijke kosten door henzelf of door een glazenwassersbedrijf te reinigen zijn
9377201 hieruit blijkt dat de regelgeving voor veilig en gezond glazenwassen ook voor architecten projectontwikkelaars bouwondernemers en eindgebruikers van belang is zodra een gebouw er staat en de gebreken ervaren worden is het oordeel van de arbiters immers helder het is voor ons een stimulans in ons streven naar een veiliger situatie voor onze leden een glazenwasser moet ook gewoon op een veilige manier zijn werk kunnen doen

9377210 i wish this years team the best of luck at valhalla
9377211 i thought we showed a lot of character in the first half going down 1 0 and basically responding right away with two goals
9377212 but thats been the character of our team all season the second half wasnt the most artistic it was one of those where we had to hang on it didnt seem like we got any breaks on the calls but our guys held tough sometimes when youre not playing your best youve got to find different ways to win overall im just proud of our team and our character
9377213 schelotto is somebody who can be considered for mvp of the league this year
9377214 the guys know he can make special plays and get the ball into them in the right positions hes been doing it for us all season the key thing is to get him into spots where he can make a difference and weve been able to do that on a pretty consistent basis this year
9377215 i think hesmer is one of the top goalkeepers in this league chad marshall i think has got to be a candidate for defender of the year for sure he is the automatic winner of comeback of the year because he played just 12 games last year with the concussion andy iro stepped in today for danny orourke and had a solid game weve never lost a game when gino padula started for us getting him back on the field helps us because hes smart positionally and is solid frankie hejduk is always buzzing and continues to give you that
9377216 last week he picked up his first assist and today he comes up with the goal it was great because we actually moved him to the other side of the field we thought maybe we could get a little luck with robbie rogers on the other side and he just made a great run off the ball he does so many other little things for our team which dont get seen but are very important to maintain the rhythm
9377217 were not looking ahead to any other game the game that we just played we dwell on for a few hours whether it be good or bad and then its on to prepare for the next game at hand i think in the past weve looked too far ahead and were not doing that this year
9377218 weve had good results here in a row but the next one is the most important
9377219 new england is right behind us and it seems like the east just gets closer and closer with each passing week

9377238 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9377239 mccain has chosen to balance his ticket with a principled conservative governor palins life story is one of sticking to principle she is living proof that a person can take on the corrupt political establishment including corrupt leaders in her own party and achieve great things
9377240 theres an old expression in politics go along to get along not this time the selection of sarah palin is one big kick in the pants to the corrupt establishment in both parties
9377241 the sexist bile of the the dnc obama and the pods is really in the docket now what idiots dean brazille and the dnc are
9377242 this is a dangerous political choice for democrats in great part because of moronic responses by pb 1 0 the so called progressive blogosphere that delighted in vicious hatemongering against hillary clinton that belittle and underestimate her
9377243 tim kaine who has exactly the same experience as palin was treated by the media and the dems as a serious and acceptable potential pick it opens up charges of a double standard
9377244 easton mcneal reports that in a message asking for money a female democratic member of congress said that palin is
9377245 i think the bigger story here is why sara was doing fetal genetic testing at 4 months was she considering an abortion potentially
9377246 you think mccain maybe misunderstood that just because shes his running mate doesnt mean he gets to mate with her
9377247 heres a pot of money take 18 months to write a book
9377248 f air or unfair and i do think it is a more concentrated criticism that hillary gets on so many fronts and i think that is unfortunate she does herself a disservice to even mention it
9377249 yes there was sexism pelosi told a group of reporters pelosi also said that she has been a victim of sexism all the time
9377250 more than anything else she is a clear warning someone in the mccain campaing has a brain bigger than roves bigger than mccains fear that if you long for democratic victory this fall
9377251 if women want any rights more than theys got why dont they just take them and not be talking about it
9377252 agencies had caught on that chennault was the go between between nixon and his people and president thieu in saigon the idea was to bring things to a stop in paris and prevent any show of progress
9377253 im speaking on behalf of mr nixon its very important that our vietnamese friends understand our republican position and i hope you made that clear to them
9377254 you should know that in 1980 the republicans approached me with an arms deal if i could arrange to keep the hostages in iran until after the elections
9377255 the offer to arafat was if you block the release of hostages then the white house would be open for the plo
9377256 i guess the same offer was given to others and i believe that some accepted to do it and managed to block the release of hostages
9377257 told me that if i do not accept this proposal they the republicans would make the same offer to my rivals
9377258 lastly he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination
9377259 im sorry im only the decoy but he pointing at will dramatically is your quarry

9377281 i have for a long time been of the opinion that the quantity of noise anyone can comfortably endure is in inverse proportion to his mental powers the man who habitually slams doors instead of shutting them with the hand is not merely ill mannered but also coarse and narrow minded

9377294 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9377295 its unbelievable we were the only people to do that which means the mccain camp didnt
9377296 i am not aware of the mccain campaign researching our archives but archive requests do not usually go through me
9377297 his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9377298 youre running flat into the wall of my ignorance here
9377299 i truly have no indication whatsoever the extent of a relationship that exists with the governor of alaska
9377300 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9377301 would you continue state funding for the proposed knik arm and gravina island bridges
9377302 while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9377303 mr chairman the great and glorious state of globule gulch home of more than 50 hotdog stands per square mile and the most beautiful women on earth the place where george washington once slept and where cows peacefully graze on our healthy grass proudly casts it 85 votes for its favorite son governor lushpuppy billings
9377304 her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear
9377305 i served with hillary clinton i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine you sarah palin are no hillary clinton
9377306 sarah palin changed all that she was not only a surprise choice but also an electrifying one and her selection has far reaching implications her entry will change the nature of the presidential race and if the mccain palin ticket wins it has the potential to carry republicans through a rough patch and even ensure conservative dominance of the party for years to come
9377307 all american but hyper american what other country in the developed world produces beauty queens who hunt caribou and serve up a terrific moose stew next to her resume a guy whos done nothing but serve in the phony baloney job of community organizer and write multiple autobiographies looks like just another creepily self absorbed lifelong member of the full time political class that infests every advanced democracy
9377308 mccains supporters argue that he is more serious about national security than barack obama but the selection of sarah palin invites the question how serious can he be if he would place such a neophyte second in line to the presidency
9377309 so this is the future of the republican party you are looking at a future in which national security has bumped down the list of priorities behind abortion politics gender politics and energy politics ms palin is a bold pick and probably a shrewd one its not nearly so clear that she is a responsible pick or a wise one
9377310 either mccain thinks the war on terror isnt serious or he thinks the vice presidency isnt
9377311 we have shown the same color by numbers mindset that liberals did when they rallied to obama liberals love obama because he is a numinous negro conservatives love palin because she has a downs baby and an m 16 for both sides that is all on earth ye know and all ye need to know you might call it mystical and childish may i be so wrong that a hundred harpies will pluck my eyeballs
9377312 the choice also says a lot about mccain first that he is a bit desperate
9377313 second that he is one arrogant sob mccain is essentially telling the world that he doesnt really need a vice president rather the office would seem poised to return to the proverbial warm bucket of p category
9377314 it all comes down to whether palin holds up under intense scrutiny
9377315 inexperience palin has been governor for about two minutes thanks to mccains decision palin could be commander in chief next year that may strike people as a reckless choice it strikes me that way to the extent the experience qualifications and national security arguments are taken off the table obama wins and its not just foreign policy palin has no experience dealing with national domestic issues either tokenism can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9377316 both a daring and brilliant choice mccain has given conservatives a reason to have a stake in this election
9377317 a spectre is haunting the liberal elites of new york and washington the spectre of a young attractive unapologetic conservatism rising out of the american countryside free of the taint fair or unfair of the bush administration and the recent republican congress able to invigorate a mccain administration and to govern beyond it that spectre has a name sarah palin the 44 year old governor of alaska chosen by john mccain on friday to be his running mate there she is a working woman whos a proud wife and mother a traditionalist in important matters whos broken through all kinds of barriers a reformer whos a republican a challenger of a corrupt good old boy establishment whos a conservative a successful woman whose life is unapologetically grounded in religious belief a lady whos a leader
9377318 people across the nation struggle with the idea of building a bridge because they
9377319 would not stand in the way of the progress toward that bridge

9377329 o am r of the believers do you have any proof of ownership
9377330 as for me i testify that this is the judgment of the prophets the amir of the believers himself takes me to his judge and the judge rules against him i bear witness that there is no deity deserving worship but allah and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah by allah the armor is yours o amir of the believers i followed the army when you were on your way to the battle of siff n and the armor came out of your equipment

9377371 i tend to defend the 50s against those who think of them as just a damp patch between the battlefield of the 40s and the fairground of the 60s and they were certainly great for people like me but the book call the midwife by jennifer worth describes a very different scene not sunny little children in short trousers as in the hovis ads but toddlers dressed only from the thigh upwards no nappies and squalid outside privies used by half a dozen families theres a description of a death from an abortion which is not the fairly sanitized account shown in the film vera drake but steel prongs and floods of blood the author describes a mad old woman who lives in one room with a hole in the roof with toenails curling round inside the boots she hasnt taken off for years the author saw her as just a local nuisance until she found out about her history a long grim tale of poverty and abuse and despair that ended with her being taken into a victorian workhouse separated entirely from her children who died one by one well at least the workhouses had gone by the 50s
9377372 we have raised 4 million on the internet i wish i had taken her a month ago
9377373 i woke up and my e mail was just going crazy
9377374 and then when it was announced it was like you couldnt breathe
9377375 its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9377376 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9377377 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9377378 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9377379 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9377380 my wife and i watched an msnbc special on her last night
9377381 my wife knew nothing about this woman but she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had
9377382 dozens of e mails and the phones have been ringing off the hook
9377383 they were taunting me saying mccains going to disappoint you
9377384 boy what kind of prayers have you been saying for mccain
9377385 he went and chose a pentecostal for his running mate
9377386 finally we can get 100 percent behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9377387 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9377388 while barack obama wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9377389 every shooter every hunter every gun owner every competitor needs to understand that it is time to in the words of bruce willis cowboy the f up
9377390 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9377391 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9377392 palin could play strong in the sporting states like michigan ohio and pennsylvania depending on how they use her
9377393 most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they dont know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene but among sportsmen authenticity counts and palins got that and then some
9377394 i can tell you that this pick tells millions in the base of the party that they can trust mccain more specifically that they can trust him with supreme court picks and other key appoitments
9377395 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9377396 one scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow the other rearranged his schedule and is flying in wednesday i got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the mccain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for mccain sans the candidate before the thursday deadline when mccain shifts to the public financing system i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grass roots like this
9377397 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9377398 the choice is to shore up the conservative pro drilling base
9377399 this is an aggressive on offense pick not a defensive pick
9377400 he floated the pro abortion running mate then there was his performance at the saddleback debate and then you had the lieberman headfake and now this
9377401 who hasnt wanted to kill someone with a garden gnome

9377406 our productivity in clearing contaminated areas will be cut by 50 percent at the end of the month when the teams stop their work
9377407 and 2009 is a whole other story without funding we will have to stop all the teams
9377408 of course we are afraid to work and do our jobs but we have to we have to put food on the table
9377409 43 percent of the areas affected by the cluster bombs dropped during the july 2006 war have been cleared and the direct threat has been eliminated from 49 percent of the contaminated areas which means the surface bombs have been removed
9377410 aside from the cluster bombs we still have 300 000 landmines along the blue line the frontier with israel
9377411 many of the bombs were dropped on agricultural lands which means farmers are staying away from their land
9377412 we will continue to feel the effects of cluster bombs for another 100 or 200 years
9377413 this area was supposed to be clean but our neighbor was hurt just the other day when one blew up there are some areas where you cant even work the land
9377414 i saw one with a white string on it in the field and ran away i also saw one on the road when we first came back
9377415 the united nations has repeatedly requested cluster bomb data from israel including maps and the type of ordnance dropped but in two years plus we still havent received the requested data
9377416 this remains the main obstacle to the cluster bomb clearing effort
9377417 i was hurt from head to toe my stomach was literally blown open and i lost sight in my right eye

9377430 uncle buck went over there with me to their jr day and sr camp and he already knows their coaches really well but uncle mike had never been over there i think he loved it as much as i did i believe laugh
9377431 i had never been over there for gameday i got to witness the atmosphere yesterday man so far that is the best atmosphere i have seen yet and the grove i know i will not see anything better than that place but really the whole atmosphere is what stood out to me the most about ole miss the fans are just so into ole miss over there and the grove is just a cool place to tailgate like i said it is the best atmosphere i have seen yet for any game i have been to at any school
9377432 that was nice a lot of the fans knew who i was and were telling me how glad they were to see me at ole miss that made me feel good i had never seen that many fans at a walk through for the players and the best part of it was that it was in the grove and i cant describe it but the grove is just different than anything i had ever seen their walk through was exciting real exciting i would love to be a part of that some day
9377433 i wanted to see how the cornerbacks played they play man to man at ole miss very aggressive just like the way i like to play i pretty much knew how they were going to play because i have been following them since they were at arkansas but i just wanted to see if they were going to do the same things at ole miss and they did
9377434 me and coach vaughn are real cool i have been knowing him since he was at arkansas he coaches my style of play and i trust him he is good friends with my uncle too coach buck i guess you can say that we are real familiar with coach vaughn and all of their coaches really
9377435 he just said ole miss was my home and that he was going to go get a lot of great players to come in with me if i commit to them
9377436 nothing has changed at all i feel real good about my decision real good i just want to wait until my press conference on friday to announce it

9377446 with the new storm track we think the entire metro area will experience the storm
9377447 sunday morning thats what were looking at to issue that mandatory evacuation
9377448 the contractor is not necessarily doing what they promised to do
9377449 im not aware of that i wont have any further comment but thats not my understanding
9377450 we are definitely ready we definitely have the situation under control we can evacuate everyone who may wish to leave the city before gustav arrives
9377451 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9377452 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9377453 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9377454 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9377455 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9377456 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9377457 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9377458 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9377459 i want to believe that i can make some quick money off this and remind people that i am alive
9377460 sending the army into media houses to shut down palestinian media is another sign of bullying and intolerance by the israeli authorities
9377461 the ifj asks for the immediate release of the detained journalists
9377462 we need a full inquiry into why this action took place and the ending of all ongoing and illegitimate targeting of media and journalists in the palestinian territories
9377463 it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world

9377475 i was really pleased to be able to get this win i went away in the break but then i wanted to be sure my team mates didnt need my help either
9377476 but when i heard that marco had attacked and had got 40 seconds on the main group i thought he would be all right because hes one of the best time triallists in the world
9377477 it was not easy doing what i had to do each time i went up saint patricks i felt different the first time i was going great the next time i felt terrible it wasnt at all clear what was going to happen from one lap to the next but then i just went for it and it worked out fine

9377484 there was no tour of unicomm at study at the vic day as we need to be sure that all our 15 student accommodation options are of the highest standard before we provide tours and information for prospective residents in addition we did not feel it was appropriate to be taking future students through accommodation when current residents were clearly unhappy

9377509 from my personal meetings with hitler i learned about his basic belief that the only hope for an ordered world was that it should be ruled by three super powers the british empire the greater americas and the new german reich
9377510 for much of the 1920s hanfstaengel introduced hitler to munich high society and helped polish his image

9377535 the most irresponsible decision by any leading presidential candidate since bush picked quayle
9377536 most years vice presidential picks end up having little concrete impact on the outcome voters usually tell pollsters they care little about the second name on the ticket
9377537 but the 2008 race already unusual in other ways could be an exception because both choices are meant to deal with key issues the presidential candidates havent been able to solve on their own

9377689 israel with the strong backing of the united states refused to recognize the democratically elected hamas government and withheld payment of the millions in taxes collected by the israelis on its behalf this caused great economic hardship and undermined the ability of the government to function but it did not reduce popular support for hamas among palestinians and it reinforced the position of islamic and other extremists who oppose negotiations with israel
9377690 anyone who has the temerity to suggest any israeli instigation of or even involvement in bush administration war planning is inevitably labeled somewhere along the way as an anti semite just whisper the word domination anywhere in the vicinity of the word israel as in u s israeli domination of the middle east or the u s drive to assure global domination and guarantee security for israel and some leftist who otherwise opposes going to war against iraq will trot out charges of promoting the protocols of the elders of zion the old czarist forgery that asserted a jewish plan for world domination

9377695 i support israel period i identify with israel period i never attack never criticize israel when i am not in israel
9377696 its a moral issue in the name of morality how can we not intervene
9377697 we will have to understand that jewish suffering during the holocaust no longer will serve as a protection and we certainly must refrain from using the argument of the holocaust to justify whatever we may do

9377706 it is common for members of congress and their staffs to turn to aipac first when they need information before calling the library of congress the congressional research service committee staff or administration experts
9377707 aipac is often called on to draft speeches work on legislation advise on tactics perform research collect co sponsors and marshal votes
9377708 command performances before aipac have become standard features in the life of a washington elected official like filing fec reports and hitting on interns the stylized panegyrics delivered at the annual aipac meeting have all the probative value of the dniepropetrovsk soviets birthday greeting to the soviet leader joseph stalin because the actual content is unimportant what is crucial is that the politician in question be seen to be genuflecting before the aipac board in fact to make things easier the speeches are sometimes written by an aipac employee with cosmetic changes inserted by a member of the senators or congressmans own staff
9377709 quietly lobbying congress to approve the use of force in iraq was one of aipacs successes over the past year
9377710 are we going to let the fucking jews run american foreign policy
9377711 it is not the business of other nations to make american foreign policy
9377712 it is not driven by any small cabal that is buried away somewhere that is telling president bush or me or vice president cheney or national security adviser condoleezza rice or other members of the administration what our policies should be
9377713 in his powells own state department there was a keen awareness of the strength of the jewish lobbyists
9377714 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9377715 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9377716 but the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administrations most controversial legal tactics including the wiretapping program and that still gnaws at some members of congress
9377717 fear of legal problems is one of the main reasons why smes are slow to launch internet based services from e commerce to online marketing

9377720 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9377721 we need your immediate assistance to help end the defense departments deliberate systemic betrayal of every brave american who dons the uniform and stands in harms way
9377722 sadly the 2007 walter reed scandal which resulted mostly from poor oversight and inadequate leadership pales in comparison to what we view as the deliberate manipulation of the law
9377723 the statutory intent of the law clearly and appropriately focuses the enhanced disability severance to those service members where the unfitting condition is a result of direct participation and participation of duty in the war effort
9377724 the department of defense appears to be interpreting this law in the most narrow and tightfisted way possible
9377725 i am disappointed that the department is implementing this policy in a way that makes as few veterans as possible eligible for the benefit
9377726 was to direct the enhanced benefit to those hurt in combat
9377727 such an approach is consistent with our strong belief that there must be a special distinction for those who incur disabilities while participating in the risk of combat in contrast with those injured otherwise
9377728 the law defines such disabilities as those caused by armed conflict instrumentalities of war hazardous service and conditions simulating war
9377729 the defense authorization act did not change these definitions in fact it reinforced them and it added disabilities incurred in the line of duty in a combat zone
9377730 the rating was good but they said it was not combat related
9377731 you can see chus memo confusing the issue this is a disease process that began in iraq in the line of duty
9377732 the disability did not result from a combat related injury
9377733 the list of cases like this is reprehensible and growing every day
9377734 moreover if cases like these are ruled not combat related then one can only imagine how many other less obvious cases are suffering the same fate
9377735 congress should then take immediate action to ensure dod upholds the plain and unambiguous language of the law
9377736 most of these service members have no representation in the military disability evaluation system and are therefore unaware of the benefits stolen from them they are depending on you

9377752 hepatitis b does not explain male biased sex ratio in china

9377754 the presumption was that the excess mortality came from discrimination against women by men and government

9377765 our prophet muhammed pbuh is the last prophet and the last messenger
9377766 muhammed is not the father of any men among you he is the messenger of allah and the last of the prophets
9377767 the messenger mentioned here is the prophet muhammed mustafa pbuh
9377768 perish in your rage allah knows well all the secrets of the heart
9377769 watch for the day the sky will bring forth a kind of very dense smoke
9377770 nebis are not prophets nebis are prophets whom have not been given a book nebis are prophets to whom they have not given a book
9377771 nebis are prophets to whom they havent given a book
9377772 verily i give you a book and divine wisdom when a messenger comes to you confirming what is with you the books that allah sent you you believe in him and render him help
9377773 do you agree and take this my covenant as binding on you
9377774 then bear witness and i am with you among the witnesses
9377775 nebis are prophets whom were not given a book they are the prophets that act with the books of messengers
9377776 nebis are the prophets whom were not given the book and they arrive at a decision with the books of messengers
9377777 oh beloved watch for the day the sky will bring forth a kind of very dense smoke
9377778 it is enough to believe in allah for someone to be a mumin
9377779 they do not listen what we say they do not wish to reach us
9377780 verily i give you a book and divine wisdom when a messenger comes to you confirming what is with you the books that allah sent you you believe in him and render him help
9377781 do you agree and take this my covenant as binding on you
9377782 then bear witness and i am with you among the witnesses
9377783 oh nebis i gave you a book and wisdom a messenger will come after you a messenger will come after you after nebis do you promise to help and believe in him do you admit it
9377784 so bear witness to each other and im with you among the witnesses
9377785 did not the messengers come to you from among yourselves reciting reading and explaining to you the verses of your lord and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours
9377786 yes they did but the word of torment decree of chastisement has been justified against qafirs the blasphemous ones
9377787 did not messengers come to you from among yourselves and said you will enter here did not they rehearse to you the verses of allah did not they explain to you the verses of allah did not they warn you that you will come here
9377788 yes but the word torment has been proved true against the infidels
9377789 when a messenger comes to you with what you do not like for he said something that is diffucult for your souls some you declared to be false and some you slay
9377790 take the truth from the quran and talk to people with the quran
9377791 we send create messengers in every nation for they reach allah and eschew satan andsave themselves from human and jinn demons some of them reached hidayet and being astray became inevitable for some of them
9377792 those who do not wish to reach while they live are unaware of our verses
9377793 so n so could really use your prayer right now you may not know but yada yada
9377794 for me 1 2 and 3 make the most sense
9377795 oh i never thought about a thats interesting but how does 3 fit in for you
9377796 sir we just intercepted a message the korx declared war on the altairans
9377797 dispatch a couple calibans to altairan space i want an inspection of altairan defenses
9377798 yessir but if we intervene we will lose all of the trade routes with the korx
9377799 do you really think thats going to matter to me
9377800 no sir im just pointing out that they are our biggest trade partner
9377801 order captains kaijon and greeb to engage the korx were going to war
9377802 i live with a roommate an older man who is refusing to leave
9377803 i cant in good conscience leave him behind but i want to leave i dont have the energy to go through this again after katrina
9377804 at this point after seeing the weather report im starting to change my mind
9377805 barangsiapa yang berpuasa dengan penuh iman dan berazam bersungguh sungguh allah mengampun dosa dosanya yang telah lalu dan barangsiapa yang bersolat pada malam bulan ramadhan dengan penuh iman dan berazam bersungguh sungguh allah mengampunkan dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
9377806 ya rasulullah alangkah baiknya jika kamu memberi keringanan kepada kami pada malam ini
9377807 sesungguhnya sesiapa yang bersolat terawih bersama imam sehingga selesai maka allah menulis baginya ganjaran seumpama bersolat sepanjang malam
9377808 dua rakaat dua rakaat maka apabila kamu bimbang waktu subuh akan masuk maka tutupilah solat solat kamu itu dengan satu rakaat solat witir
9377809 carilah lailatul qadar pada malam malam yang ganjil daripada sepuluh malam yang terakhir daripada bulan ramadhan
9377810 carilah pada sepuluh malam terakhir yakni lailatul qadar jika seseorang kamu lemah atau tidak mampu maka janganlah dia kalah putus asa pada baki tujuh malam yang terakhir
9377811 pada pagi hari selepas lailatul qadar matahari terbit dengan sinaran yang tidak menyilau atau tidak terik
9377812 wahai rasulullah apa pendapatmu apabila aku mendapati salah satu malam daripada lailatul qadar apakah yang sepatutnya aku ucapkan
9377813 ya allah sesungguhnya engkau adalah yang maha pengampun lagi maha mengasihi untuk mengampun maka ampunilah aku
9377814 com certeza foi mais dif cil que no ano passado
9377815 achei meio dif cil s falaram de desmatamento polui o meio ambiente poderiam ter escolhido um tema mais atual como o nosso tr nsito
9377816 a parte dos gr ficos foi a mais dif cil isso n o comigo
9377817 estavam muito na cara muito f ceis a reda o tamb m n o foi dif cil
9377818 eles queriam que a gente apresentasse propostas para evitar o desmatamento
9377819 they said they were going to fix it but they never came back
9377820 theres an unresponsive man in our foyer i think he might be dead
9377821 yeah hes breathing but hes completely non responsive the scenes safe theres no apparent mechanism of injury and there are no obvious wounds
9377822 none of us are actually going anywhere but you should be were all just marking time waiting for the fates to step in and change things
9377823 das sind jahrhundertealte traditionen und ich werde sie weiter verteidigen
9377824 the figures announced by the committee are possibly less than the actual number because since yesterday sunday we have received news about three more murder cases that will be announced once the details are known
9377825 when a father or paternal grandfather kills a child ghesas a religious term for punishment cannot be conducted and the perpetrator is only liable for financial restitution
9377826 when a man observes his wife during an act of consensual sex with another man he the husband can rightfully kill them both and in case the wife was a non consenting actor then the husband can rightfully kill the man the same is applicable to physical harms
9377827 i know of a man who knocked his wife unconscious set her on fire and put a pillow over her mouth to asphyxiate and silence her of course the women died but before her death she told the nurse what had happened considering such a horrible act the man in this case ended up paying just 40 000 000 rial 4 300 usd as restitution
9377828 the islamic republic discriminates and violates the rights of iranian kurds especially kurdish women
9377829 i confirm that i am in fact lesbian gay bisexual and that i have sex with my ball partner
9377830 i promise not to bully anyone signing the other contract
9377831 this is a disturbing case in that the defendant is alleged to have invaded his victims privacy in the place she should feel safest her home
9377832 that thing would take your hand off given half a chance
9377833 you cant have ukrainians in here because people have expensive things here and im responsible if something gets stolen
9377834 i have already announced my decision to the german cycling federation bdr that i will not be available to represent them again
9377835 until today the reasons of my non selection for beijing were not given to me
9377836 unfortunately i read in the press the federations chief technical officer thought that i was not cut out for the single day races
9377837 more so because i didnt compete in the tour de france this year especially so i could prepare for the olympics
9377838 ich hatte mal ne alte auf malle ging so hab ich jetzt nicht mehr in spanien isses ja so entweder isse schlank dann hat se keine titten oder sie hat titten dann isse aber fett den perfekten mix kriegste nur in polen
9377839 hermann komm schnell so was das schreib ich in die zeitung dass die einem die t r zu drehen wenn man einsteigen will das ist ein skandal das ist ein skandal das schreib ich inne zeitung sowat aber auch hermann ne k ln deutz ist das hier nach k ln deutz ja gut drau en am zug steht n mlich m nster wo ist denn das berhaupt m nster ich kenne nur ein m nster das ist aber nicht hier wo fahren wir denn berhaupt lang f hrt der nach k ln und auch nach k ln deutz was ist das hier berhaupt ne hermann dat schreib ich inner zeitung dat die am sonntag keinen auffem bahnsteig stehen haben der wat durchsacht so wat nee wo fahren wir denn berhaupt lang oh gott kannste drau en wat erkennen hermann da der atommeiler den kenn ich wat sagen die dormagen hermann wir sind richtig oder f hrt der hier nach k ln deutz da m ssen wir n mlich umsteigen wir sind seit 15 jahren nicht mehr mit dem zug gefahren hermann nee du ich muss getz erstmal den hund beruhigen

9377842 certainly i am very pleased that after our success in having the pumps made available to young people we are now expanding access to everyone who qualifies
9377843 that of course was my goal when i brought forward my private members legislation in the last parliament this is extremely great news that will dramatically improve the quality of life for people living with diabetes
9377844 covering the cost of insulin pumps for adult ontarians with type 1 diabetes is a crucial component of our diabetes strategy
9377845 by improving the way we prevent treat and manage diabetes thousands of ontarians will benefit from a better quality of life
9377846 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans we have to join the 300 million other americans on behalf of our fellow citizens its a time for action so were going to suspend most of our activities tomorrow except for those absolutely necessary
9377847 tomorrows program will be business only and will refrain from any political rhetoric that would be traditional in an opening session of a convention
9377848 we must redirect our efforts from the really celebratory event of the nomination of president and vice president of our party to acting as all americans
9377849 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention to act as americans not republicans because america needs us now no matter whether we are republican or democrat he said
9377850 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9377851 im optimistic above all because of the game that ronaldinho had
9377852 it was a strange game one of those surprises that can happen at the beginning of the season
9377853 we played a good game we attacked for 90 minutes and there were two instances when bologna was better than us
9377854 it was an open game that could have gone either way
9377855 i guess its just nice to play well pretty simple
9377856 it was one of my goals coming into this season next to trying to win wimbledon i missed that one oh well
9377857 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9377858 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9377859 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9377860 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9377861 it gave me a license to go out there and have a go
9377862 freddie flintoff led us well in the middle of the innings and put us back on track
9377863 but after identifying all those departments we need to work on there are signs we are getting some things right hopefully well be able to put in a big performance in cardiff
9377864 in the case of pch the protein complex the so called trna splicing endonuclease is mutated this complex in involved in the manufacture of proteins in the human body and was identified in connection with a disease for the first time
9377865 the identification of mutations which cause pch2 and pch4 is an important step in the research of ponto cerebellar hypoplasia
9377866 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
9377867 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
9377868 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial
9377869 if present at all was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9377870 the healthy user effect is everywhere you dont want it to be
9377871 while such a reduction in all cause mortality would have been impressive these mortality benefits are likely implausible previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9377872 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the united states are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9377873 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation watch what they eat come in regularly for health maintenance visits and disease screenings take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9377874 but you also need to take care of yourself everyone can reduce their risk by taking simple precautions
9377875 wash your hands avoid sick kids and hospitals during flu season consider antiviral agents for prophylaxis and tell your doctor as soon as you feel unwell because there is still a chance to decrease symptoms and prevent hospitalization if you get sick because flu vaccine is not as effective as people have been thinking it is
9377876 we pay tribute to that world its proper to the pantheon but j j abrams kept reminding us this is not a parody of any kind we were all keen to avoid playing the actors from the old series but instead play our characters as we saw fit
9377877 the star trek franchise also had three other spin off shows in the new movie the first star trek rules though
9377878 theres a lot of little ironies in there that youll pick up on if you know the series and you know the mythology

9377907 he did not ask ahmad ismail to apologise for his statement did not ask him to retract his statement and did not initiate disciplinary action for
9377908 an apology is not enough to the chinese community we want umno to take disciplinary action against him we want him to leave barisan and umno because he has broken the racial harmony of the parties

9377910 we are racist so what you dont like it what are you going to do about it what can you do about it
9377911 racism by its simplest definition is the belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race people with racist beliefs might hate certain groups of people according to their racial groups in the case of institutional racism certain racial groups may be denied rights or benefits or get preferential treatment
9377912 as the chinese were only immigrants it was impossible to achieve equal rights amongst races

9377917 eles queriam que a gente apresentasse propostas para evitar o desmatamento
9377918 it was another great battle with stoner we know that stoner is very strong
9377919 to win my 68th race in my home town is incredible i saw giacomo agostini before the race and he was laughing so i said to him i would try to win today
9377920 we have a great advantage and we are one race closer to the title last year in these three races i took nine points this year 75 so its not too bad
9377921 the situation has not changed at all the negotiations are continuing and i still wish to leave madrid i want to play for chelsea
9377922 the president and pedja mijatovic said they will let me leave but schuster doesnt because he has promised to make me feel comfortable again if he thinks that its his problem i dont want to stay at real madrid
9377923 the behavior of chelsea officials who despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player have continued to make gestures and statements and have even sold the players shirt on its official web site all this has done nothing but aggravate the situation and confuse public opinion
9377924 there is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player so we completely refute any criticism from real madrid
9377925 as for the issue regarding the web site real are well aware this was a regrettable accident by an external supplier which was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention and not a single shirt was sold
9377926 calderon said that if a good offer came in they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort to sign me
9377927 my agent has gone a thousand times to talk to the club and the club has shown no interest in me staying now as the club hasnt signed anyone its in their interest for me to stay
9377928 ill recover because im young im not refusing to play i have a contract if they make me play i will although i wont be happy
9377929 nobody wants to go back to the time of the cold war nato is not an adversary but a partner of russia as for the eu it seeks to build with this country a close and positive relation it is for russia today to make a fundamental choice
9377930 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9377931 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9377932 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia
9377933 russia may pretend with its petro power and wealth to be immune from any actions by the west but beyond the short term it is vulnerable
9377934 we needed something to kickstart the season to lift the season and give the players some confidence
9377935 we need to respect tottenham they are a very good team and play very well and sometimes makes it impossible to win
9377936 we had more chances but we made mistakes with the final shots they put five six seven eight nine players in the back and it was difficult to create
9377937 this is why we made more mistakes we need to try to work more with the ball
9377938 he remained in a deep dark mist far from the light of truth
9377939 when the water of regeneration cleansed the impurity of my former life a light from on high shone into my heart and the spirit transformed me into a new man by a second birth then at once in a miraculous manner certainty replaced doubt mysteries were revealed and darkness became light then it was possible to acknowledge that what was born of the flesh and lived for sin was earthly but what the holy spirit had vivified began to be of god in god and from god is all our strength through him we while living upon the earth have a hint of future bliss
9377940 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
9377941 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
9377942 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
9377943 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
9377944 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times
9377945 conversations were held but they did not produce concrete results
9377946 agroindustrial recovery would have greatly benefited if foreign capital had been allowed to participate on a greater scale particularly in sugar production
9377947 we cannot produce just sugar any more no one in the world is doing that
9377948 based on an updated recommendation of the parks department we are reducing the hours of operation of
9377949 my country also has a custom we hang people who burn women
9377950 che mondo sarebbe senza las roma un mondo de merda
9377951 what we need is a market for sick people in normal markets entrepreneurs go after unmet needs thats how entrepreneurs make money but in health care weve made it very difficult for people to make a profit by meeting the needs of sick people

9377953 just look at red sox second baseman dustin pedroia and the year hes having the difference between him and cano is the difference between the teams pedroia doesnt have one quarter the talent of cano but hes outplaying him by a mile
9377954 no way they should have given robbie that contract hes the last guy who should have gotten a contract like that
9377955 they never gave a deal like that to derek jeter or bernie williams or jorge posada or mariano rivera with so much time to go before free agency they could have given it to cano or chien ming wang they picked the wrong guy
9377956 i dont believe its the contract he came in and worked hard and he was constantly in the weight room
9377957 i think bowas a tremendous coach one of the best third base coaches ive ever seen maybe the best but i dont think coaches make players players make players
9377958 i just know if we hit better wed be better
9377959 we havent hit thats the biggest reason for where we are this teams dna was supposed to mean 900 runs weve had injuries but we havent performed
9377960 the red sox are fucking awesome everyone bow down to their greatness and get out of their fucking way as they roll to another title
9377961 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9377962 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9377963 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9377964 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9377965 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9377966 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system
9377967 you know what this means dont you milwaukeeans on the south side you are about to get screwed
9377968 residents of the north side along with their representatives aided by the bleeding heart milwaukee journal will play the race card right up until the first snowflake of next winter
9377969 theres nothing wrong with that mind you just not at the expense of other areas of the city

9377975 the american people believe washington is broken and for good reason
9377976 as grassroots republicans we demand a return to our partys core principles
9377977 we will impose an immediate moratorium on the earmarking system
9377978 we have won a stage and placed myself as leader just like we did in the tour de france which was my aim for the day
9377979 it would have been different in the olympics if i had run like this
9377980 but the past is the past and this is the present
9377981 i am very frustrated and disappointed with what happened in beijing
9377982 it was so frustrating having to watch rather than perform i know i would have been the man to put pressure on him bolt but thats what ive got to work towards now but i look forward to meeting usain and finishing my season strongly
9377983 its a bit difficult to come down off the high of the olympics and im still feeling a little tired
9377984 id have loved to have won but it just wasnt to be today
9377985 we all wanted to win the olympics but to beat the medalists here was nice
9377986 i had problems with my achilles tendon so this makes up for that now im looking forward to the rest of the season
9377987 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9377988 maybe i should have gone to play gleneagles but i stuck by my word
9377989 looking back at the time i made the right decision for me but it was so difficult to choose the right thing to do and its obviously been a very difficult decision to try to get across
9377990 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer
9377991 he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9377992 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9377993 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9377994 im very proud of myself and pleased with the weekend especially friday afternoon
9377995 i think at least it proved to people i can do it when i need to
9377996 i think that was the key week getting me on the team
9377997 i certainly stalled in the middle of the campaign and it became hard work
9377998 i felt a lot of pressure today my drive at the last was my worst of the week
9377999 we really deserved to win and we could have scored another couple of goals
9378000 it was very important for me to score i am extremely pleased that it finally happened

9378005 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics
9378006 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out what is going on is fine
9378007 i have every expectation we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9378008 so where obama had a network infomercial viewed by close to 40 million people theres little chance we will get the same one time show to reach such a large audience

9378010 as doctors we sell our services under the banner of science many patients have begun to question the quality transparency and honesty of our science unfortunately they are doing so with good reason when our patients lose trust in the integrity of the science we may never be able to recover our status as a profession we ignore questioning patients at our peril bob fiddaman is a question asker he is persistent and he is angry he is also right we need to start listening

9378038 so what are you going to do about it whitey
9378039 developments equaling approximately 1 148 megawatts of wind generated electricity
9378040 according to the u s department of energy all u s electrical energy needs could be met by the wind in texas and the dakotas alone
9378041 from 3 000 to 5 000 for every kilowatt of generating capacity or about 40 000 for a 10 kw installed system
9378042 how many solar cells would i need in order to provide all of the electricity that my house needs
9378043 you need about 41 000 square inches of solar panel for the house thats a solar panel that measures about 285 square feet about 26 square meters that would cost around 16 000 right now then because the sun only shines part of the time you would need to purchase a battery bank an inverter etc and that often doubles the cost of the installation

9378047 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution since the correctness or fallacy of that conclusion has immense implications for public policy and for the future of the biosphere we thought it appropriate to present a debate within the pages of p amp s concerning that conclusion
9378048 basic atmospheric models clearly predict that additional greenhouse gasses will raise the temperature of earth to argue otherwise one must prove a physical mechanism that gives a reasonable alternative cause of warming this has not been done sunspot and temperature correlations do not prove causality
9378049 the first sentence is nothing more or less than a deliberate lie
9378050 the second is to say the least contentious while the third is an outrageous example of ultra vires interference by a committee in the proper conduct of scientific debate
9378051 if the council has not scientifically evaluated or formally considered my paper may i ask with what credible scientific justification and on whose authority the offending text asserts primo that the paper had not been scientifically reviewed when it had secundo that its conclusions disagree with what is said on no evidence to be the
9378052 the council of the american physical society disagrees with this articles conclusions
9378053 it is of no little significance that the ipccs value for the coefficient in the co2 forcing equation depends on only one paper in the literature that its values for the feedbacks that it believes account for two thirds of humankinds effect on global temperatures are likewise taken from only one paper and that its implicit value of the crucial parameter depends upon only two papers one of which had been written by a lead author of the chapter in question and neither of which provides any theoretical or empirical justification for a value as high as that which the ipcc adopted
9378054 since we cannot measure any individual forcing directly in the atmosphere the models draw upon results of laboratory experiments in passing sunlight through chambers in which atmospheric constituents are artificially varied
9378055 such experiments are however of limited value when translated into the real atmosphere where radiative transfers and non radiative transports convection and evaporation up advection along subsidence and precipitation down as well as altitudinal and latitudinal asymmetries greatly complicate the picture

9378060 the constitution forbids government officials to meddle in religious matters
9378061 decisions about religion are up to parents not school board members
9378062 if parents want their children to have a bible they are perfectly free to go out and buy one
9378063 in the cafeteria students who choose to take bibles and those who choose not to will be visible to much if not all of the student community a prospect made more likely given the schools small size 427 students
9378064 any child visibly ignoring the availability of the bibles or returning to class empty handed will stand out to his peers and thus feel pressured to take a bible

9378127 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9378128 i dont know if there is anything to getting the ball and having first crack at it or giving it up and having that first possession in the second half
9378129 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not

9378132 lauren coming alive is a very good sign for us were coming together as an attacking team and were excited
9378133 as sunday games usually are the circumstances are difficult it was hot and we played a tough game on friday one of the best things today was our depth we got some good contributions from our bench
9378134 i was feeling good at the half and i thought the first 15 minutes of the second half we played very well we came out strong and it was just unfortunate
9378135 selfless play allowed the team to score six goals and overall it was an excellent team performance if we continue to develop from one game to the next as we did from the game against delaware to todays game were in for a great season

9378141 nabi saw melakukan shalat pada bulan ramadhan dua puluh rakaat dan witir
9378142 rasulullah saw melakukan shalat pada bulan ramadhan sebanyak delapan rakaat dan witir
9378143 sesungguhnya nabi saw tidak menambah di dalam bulan ramadhan dan tidak pula mengurangkannya dari 11 rakaat
9378144 jika seseorang melakukan sholat tarawih sebagaimana mazhab abu hanifah dan ahmad yaitu 20 rakaat atau sebagaimana mazhab malik yaitu 36 rakaat atau 13 rakaat atau 11 rakaat maka itu yang terbaik
9378145 sholat tarawih 11 rakaat atau 13 rakaat melakukan salam pada setiap 2 rakaat dan 1 rakaat witir adalah afdal meniru cara nabi saw dan siapa pula yang sholatnya 20 rakaat atau lebih maka juga tidak salah

9378152 we nurses become their mothers their sisters their families when theyre crying were there holding and rocking them

9378157 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9378158 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9378159 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9378160 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9378161 its not going to change its not a family show
9378162 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9378163 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9378164 i was in the back of the suite doing something
9378165 it was great to come in the dome and throw out a couple of touchdowns o line blocked just great
9378166 we didnt play our best were going to have to play better
9378167 the bendy dalek is one of the rarer toys from the 1960s
9378168 it was made from soft pliable rubber around a metal skeleton
9378169 the rubber decays and rots over time and the skeleton can weaken and snap
9378170 any toys in a poor condition after a child has played with them would normally be consigned to the rubbish bin making any examples very hard to find especially in good condition
9378171 since the show was relaunched it has been more popular than anyone could have predicted
9378172 prices for older items have increased accordingly as new people have caught the collecting bug and are trying to own items from their childhood

9378185 human culture as we have known it for the past 200 years is drawing to a close a revolution of civilization is upon us prepare
9378186 the most significant characteristic of modern civilization is the sacrifice of the future for the present and all the power of science has been prostituted to this purpose
9378187 nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could only do a little
9378188 four months of turmoil have followed in which almost every move by palin has been questioned
9378189 john mccain is to be commended on his choice of sarah palin a true christian for vice president
9378190 palin an evangelical who is pro life and pro marriage meets all the criterion that cadc set forth for a vp pick unfortunately obama chose joe biden a liberal catholic who is not in compliance with christian moral teaching on abortion or homosexuality
9378191 will mccain pick a pro choice republican or perhaps a moderate mormon or a liberal jew
9378192 unless mccain picks a true christian for vice president real conservative christians are being disenfranchised from this presidential election
9378193 obama missed a great chance to reach out to christians now we will see if mccain will let conservative christians have someone we can vote for not just vote against
9378194 between an avowed pro abortion ticket that would continue to push for unrestricted abortion on demand and a strongly pro life ticket that will bring us closer to a society that embraces the value and dignity of human life
9378195 healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9378196 we wondered how her using a city computer to run for lieutenant governor in 2002 was different than republican party chief randy ruedrich using alaska oil and gas conservation commission computers for party business for which he was fined and resigned under pressure she said it was different
9378197 in a release palin fired off to everyone she could think of after the questions she huffed about a smear campaign organized by her enemies powerful enemies later there were references on various radio talk shows to whispering campaigns and other craziness but we wrote that off as the vapors and a touch of paranoia
9378198 she characterized as innocuous her political e mails sent on a city computer to the alaska outdoor council and another complaining about the right to life folks not choosing her as their candidate in the 2002 race
9378199 that was bad enough indicating she just does not get it but then she had this to say weve had lots of people come forward with dirt on gubernatorial candidate john binkley as well as dirt on gov frank murkowski weve told them to bury it im not running that type of campaign
9378200 apparently that is exactly the kind of vicious campaign the former two term wasilla mayor is running in our view that kind of backdoor character assassination is the most scurrilous type of attack
9378201 oh i have dirt palin says smugly yes indeedy but ill not give the details because that would be wrong she is right it is very wrong it is very much the hallmark of lightweight politicians in over their heads
9378202 spiritus betide into labor under that intrusive the in the cards better self strength of mind not taste the slightest take to insofar as algebra

9378205 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9378206 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9378207 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9378208 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9378209 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9378210 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9378211 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9378212 its just that hes gone through this every year the last four or five years at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired
9378213 i think everybody goes through that i think its a little bit of a dead arm period
9378214 he has felt a lot better the last couple of days as he sees everything coming back hell get better hell get on his stride
9378215 i just have to wait until my arm strength and power come back
9378216 not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this i think this is the time when you have 170 innings close to 180 innings you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9378217 our medical staff was great enough to come in on a sunday and get it done so his probability of playing has increased for saturday
9378218 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9378219 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9378220 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9378221 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that
9378222 the momentum of racism has increased with time and the perception of racial discrimination in the abuses in the implementation of the new economic policy
9378223 some recent surveys also bear out this unfortunate negative trend
9378224 the barisan approach to evolving government policies and practices of national unity had become more questionable as the march 8th general elections indicated
9378225 however the outcome of the last general election should not be seen as a demise of ethno religious politics
9378226 communal politics it was also responsible for introducing the new economic policy an affirmative action plan that favours the malays
9378227 racial politics has helped to embed racism in our subconscious mind
9378228 what has changed the scene is the internet that has exposed to the world abuses of the rich over the poor across the globe and in our own country people are smarter more mature and more questioning the trends for change will continue with greater steam
9378229 race and religion can go hand in hand but our leaders must stand for all and promote better religious harmony not all do and that is the sad thing
9378230 socially we want to live and co exist harmoniously if this is our choice then we must accept that malaysia is a multiracial country and start to celebrate our diversity
9378231 the latest victory by opposition icon anwar ibrahim in the fiercely fought permatang pauh by election appears to bear out these views
9378232 they can resort to force just like burma zimbabwe and other authoritarian states but it will come with a heavy price to pay we will be reduced to the rank of pariahs in the international community
9378233 non sectarian politics in malaysia the case of parti gerakan rakyat malaysia
9378234 no evidence has been placed before me to suggest that during the last three years there has been any serious incident or activity involving any of the accused that would enliven a conclusion that there is a risk to national security
9378235 of course it might be said that they have been incarcerated restrained and subject to such stringent security measures that it is unsurprising that anything untoward has occurred
9378236 whether this be so or not the fact remains that i have not been provided with any material to suggest that during their time in prison the accused have been a risk to national security otherwise by virtue of the charge each is facing each has pleaded not guilty and is entitled to the presumption of innocence
9378237 a highly prejudicial impression that they are too dangerous to be afforded the usual open dock facility
9378238 in its desperation to have a go at muslims the bnp as it always has ignores the facts or only produces half facts to support its racism its hatred of islam
9378239 before the islamic invasion it was almost impossible to find heroin in our land
9378240 the preston pals sacrifice should not be besmirched by people engaged in political campaigning for such an ugly cause we condemn this leaflet its contents and those who are disseminating it
9378241 before the islamic invasion it was almost impossible to find heroin in our land
9378242 for all intents and purposes muslims are exclusively responsible for the heroin trade
9378243 bunglawussi watch blames bnp for connecting heroin trade with muhammedanism
9378244 if youre trying to make an ambitious movie thats for adults to talk about and start a discussion and no one gets upset about it then you havent really dealt with the subject at all
9378245 director phil alden robinson settled on neo nazis as the villains a perennial favorite at which point he wrote the following in a letter to the council on american islamic relations i hope you will be reassured that i have no intention of promoting negative images of muslims or arabs and i wish you the best in your continuing efforts to combat discrimination
9378246 certainly any movie that you make that deals with radical islam and terrorism is going to be uncomfortable for some people
9378247 that was the subject of the movie theres no getting around that
9378248 too often people only want their films to be escapist entertainment or serious thoughtful films
9378249 deep wounds caused by italian colonization to the people of libya
9378250 the accord will provide for 200 million a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9378251 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgment of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9378252 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
9378253 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
9378254 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
9378255 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
9378256 yes we wrote a letter to the security council in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
9378257 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
9378258 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
9378259 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
9378260 and they were talking just about money money money money money
9378261 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job

9378322 of the styles of art we picked for the experiment your answers suggest you like impressionism
9378323 impressionist paintings often appear on mugs calendars and posters however they werent always so socially acceptable impressionist painters were initially criticized for attempting to capture the fleeting effects of light and colour found in nature

9378338 quero frisar uma coisa que est engasgada h tempos acabaram as d vidas somos candidatos ao t tulo e que todos passem a respeitar mais o gr mio
9378339 a equipe n o conseguiu criar nada mesmo contra o santos dentro de casa n s precisamos agredir mais para conseguirmos o resultado o que n o fizemos hoje
9378340 n o foi bom o primeiro tempo voltando um pouco melhor no segundo mas mesmo assim n o sa mos com a vit ria
9378341 n o criamos muito mas tivemos a posse de bola tocamos mais s que n o chegamos muitas vezes ao gol n o tivemos situa es claras fica dif cil em um cl ssico como esse precis vamos do resultado
9378342 o posicionamento do santos principalmente no primeiro tempo n o deixou termos condi es de finalizar e nas vezes em que chegamos n o conclu mos bem n o conseguimos fazer o gol e n o foi um bom resultado
9378343 ficamos tocando de um lado para o outro n o chutamos praticamente nada e por isso n o conseguimos sair com a vit ria nessa partida
9378344 o campeonato ta come ando hoje para mim e espero que daqui h duas rodadas eu consiga entrar no ritmo ideal de jogo acho que errei alguns passes mas isso foi nitidamente pela falta do ritmo e do entrosamento que s dever ser adquirido com o decorrer dos jogos disse andrade
9378345 acho que os torcedores do sport est o de parab ns eles nos apoiaram desde antes do in cio do jogo at o apito final bom estrear tendo esse apoio vindo das arquibancadas
9378346 dou nota seis para o meu jogo de hoje n o fui mal mas sei da minha qualidade e sei que posso melhorar bastante ainda o time do sport muito bom e acho que fica mais f cil ganhar entrosamento
9378347 estou bem fisicamente e o t cnico vanderlei luxemguo confia no meu trabalho estou crescendo de produ o na hora certa j que acabamos de perder um jogador importante para o time e dolo da torcida que era o valdivia
9378348 eu agrade o aos meus companheiros que taparam muitos buracos eu sempre disse que os momentos ruins n o duram para sempre e quando voc trabalha as coisas melhoram
9378349 eu penso que ele um piloto talentos ssimo e s n o posso acreditar que a maneira como ele est dirigindo no momento a de kimi
9378350 ele sempre foi mais r pido do que o massa massa r pido mas kimi n o deveria ficar t o para tr s
9378351 as pessoas chegaram a conclus o de que o ocorrido s interessa ao max e n o tem nenhuma rela o com o automobilismo durante um per odo eu disse que deveriam demiti lo mas agora mudei de id ia
9378352 claro falo com os jogadores por telefone e pela internet passei boa parte da minha vida no clube e ainda tenho muitos amigos na g vea esse grupo do flamengo muito unido todos continuam me dando muita for a mesmo longe estou torcendo muito por eles
9378353 fui muito bem recebido pelo grupo os dois jogadores que falam espanhol logo me socorreram nos primeiros dias foi o zagueiro chileno arturo vidal e o alem o gonzalo castro que filho de espanh is eu n o falava uma palavra em alem o e eles me ajudaram e disseram que a adapta o deveria ser bem r pida pois o clube tem uma estrutura montada para receber jogadores sul americanos j tenho uma professora de alem o para me ensinar o idioma e estou estudando para compreender melhor os meus novos companheiros mesmo assim o clube colocou um int rprete minha disposi o estou muito empolgado pois o grupo jovem e todos se d o muito bem
9378354 a primeira dificuldade foi n o falar alem o dif cil chegar a um pa s sem conhecer ningu m e sem falar o idioma fui me apresentar na su a onde o clube estava fazendo a pr temporada e logo um int rprete ficou me ajudando mas quando voltei para a alemanha e tive que me virar sozinho fora do clube fiquei um pouco perdido mesmo assim consegui me virar muito bem e agora estou bem tranq ilo
9378355 o bayern tem uma tima estrutura de treinos e isso tem sido fundamental para minha adapta o
9378356 at dif cil falar estou feliz na alemanha mas claro que sinto falta da minha fam lia dos meus amigos dos meus ex companheiros de clube da praia do cimena que sempre gostei de ir de muitas coisas mas a carreira de futebol de um jogador curta e aproveitei essa tima oportunidade de trabalho que tive por isso quero me dedicar e trabalhar muito para me destacar em campo
9378357 quero conquistar t tulos com o bayern leverkusen disputar competi es europ ias e ser feliz no meu novo clube

9378360 our desire at wasilla bible church is for everyone to experience the excellence of jesus christ in their lives
9378361 by gods grace everything in the life of this church will revolve around the reality of jesus christ who he is what he has done what he is doing and what he will do
9378362 in the words of the early church he is lord and will be recognized as such in this church with an absolute allegiance that lifts him above all others in our hearts in our homes and in our congregation
9378363 it is his commands that we will obey his warnings that we will heed and his promises that we will hold
9378364 in every endeavor we will rely upon his power cherish his presence and honor his name
9378365 the roman custom of beginning a service with processional music was adopted choirs were developed and brought into the christian church
9378366 why should the devil get all the good choirs and processionals
9378367 so with its use of light color and excessive height the gothic cathedral fostered a sense of mystery transcendance and awe borrowed from plato and passed off as christian
9378368 the main message of gothic architecture is god is transcendant and unreachable so be awed at his majesty

9378514 whereas in any ordinary family the inevitable quarrels and clashes of personality could play themselves out with little damage to anyone else any private quarrels and rivalries between georgie willy and nicky were played out in public on the dangerous stage of international politics the homosexual scandals surrounding the kaiser the power exerted by alix the tsarina over her vacillating husband nicky the snubs regularly meted out to willy by his english relations none of these would have had any impact on world events but for the fact that the three cousins were also the king the kaiser and the tsar

9378521 to modern dance legend pina bausch this ancient city beside the bosphorus remains a place of mystery and movement gypsies drinkers and steamy turkish baths a bausch show is like food for your subconscious there is no plot instead she takes a series of everyday events and skews them until they become dreamlike familiar yet uncanny ultimately her productions always come back to big questions about love loneliness and the search for intimacy yet they also manage to be funny even bawdy nef s offers a uniquely bauschian take on istanbul that like its title comes as a breath of fresh air in troubled times
9378522 pina bauschs extraordinary new work is a where heart ache there is but alongside humour hope and happiness above all bausch has allowed pure movement and the beauty of choreographic invention to colour her work not only is this turkish inspired work a masterpiece of theatricality it is also a magnificent vehicle for the twenty dancers of the company in nef s bausch has created one of her finest works yet the entire work was a brilliant mixture of caf theatre humour and inventive choreography

9378548 im a carpenter and i have no way of getting my tools out if i lose them i cant make a living i have to protect them
9378549 i was in indiana the day katrina hit and i got back to devastation it was sick i cleaned shit up off the streets for months

9378555 we have friends who are not leaving they have five cats and they choose to stay i think theyre foolish because you dont know what the storms going to do but thats their decision our greatest fear after katrina is can the city recover from another one there are still areas today which dont look very different from the way they did after katrina the population is only two thirds of what it was
9378556 we thought we were going to be put in straitjackets just for getting on this flight
9378557 people who decide to stay in new orleans are in the insane category its mad loony you dont know whats going to happen it isnt safe you can have all the supplies in the world but maybe no electricity or gasoline for a long time

9378559 i remember seeing two people meet in wal mart for the first time since katrina and how emotional they were everything is before katrina or after katrina new orleans was always the city that care forgot we were happy go lucky and didnt spend time worrying that went to the wayside with katrina because terrible things happened there wasnt that comfortable feeling any more that everything will be all right
9378560 anyone who stays behind is brave some will have no means to leave and wont have been identified by the authorities other will be obliged to stay like red cross workers and some just dont want to go i think its a lie about there being no shelters its a strategy to discourage people

9378775 literally like if the redskins had just won the super bowl
9378776 i got some smoke sumthin you never seen and great price
9378777 i prolly dont have to ask this but are we official
9378778 in the beginning i had my peacock feathers on to impress you after i got you it didnt matter
9378779 you know ive never been to the philippines and im just as excited its a first for me and im glad to hear that filipinos are just as excited too
9378780 oh i have filipino acquaintances here in switzerland in the uk and in france i heard that the philippines is a beautiful country and that the filipinos really love music
9378781 oh i dont know i dont know how im supposed to feel about it you know i started singing when i was a child at the age of about eight its not like i became a star when i was 18
9378782 i suppose to i enjoyed singing when i was a child and i enjoy it now just as much now actually you know i did have some problems during my adolescence but i guess that every adolescent has problems my problems were perhaps more difficult because i was growing up in public but apart from that no problem i love singing and its a great joy to be able to do something that you like so much
9378783 lets put it this way i had a different childhood i didnt have a normal childhood i dont know what a normal childhood is childhood is a magic time and it happens very fast other children might have been going through the different stages of childhood and i must have been going through the same experience but only on a different level
9378784 i really dont know but it seems that my voice hasnt really changed since i was a child it sounds the same to me and i hope to other people i dont think my voice has changed much at all i still sing the same songs like downtown and dont sleep in the subway in the same key as when i recorded them
9378785 not really my mother was welsh i dont know much about the welsh people but i guess they are very very musical they love to sing like the italians tom jones is welsh and so is shirley bassey among the actors anthony hopkins is welsh you know music is in our veins but i didnt really come from a musical family at all
9378786 yes i do it was a song called mighty like a rose and in fact i first sang it when i was six years old at age eight i was already famous and i continued singing that song
9378787 you know i worked so hard on my career i married a frenchman and we moved to france and i became frances no 1 singer that was before 1964 when downtown was recorded the 60s were a special time for me the beatles made it much easier for british singers to be played on the radio downtown became a hit in america and i did a lot of hits after that
9378788 you know i have my downtimes as well like everybody else and in times like that i take my mind away from it and get out and see the rest of the world
9378789 i have many many fond memories you know they were wonderful years they were also complicated years because you know i was married and i had two children then we have now three children i was traveling all over the place and i was trying to be a good mother and a good performer luckily i was working with amazing people
9378790 i think you know the answer to that hmmmm you know there are good and there are bad there were good singers and bad singers then and there are good singers and bad singers now the world has changed a lot and so has the music industry and the people people dont seem to buy records as much as people back then did thats one thing i dont like about it
9378791 ahhh i was never allowed to go on the frontline there was another little girl who was also singing at that time her name is julie andrews
9378792 julie is a very very very nice lady we used to perform for the troops but in different camps
9378793 hmmm we were not exactly rivals we both just like to sing
9378794 i enjoy acting as much as i enjoy singing as a little girl i also wanted to be an actress i didnt think of myself as being a singer singing and acting are very closely related when im doing a show its wonderful because i have to act and feel what i am singing to me thats perfection when i do a concert as i am doing in manila every show is like a play in my mind so i use acting when i sing and vice versa
9378795 my family has been away in turkey and i was left home with the dogs to be honest with you i dont really live here i go to many different places geneva is a nice place to come back to when youre away for long its a very relaxing place
9378796 i write music i play the piano by the way can you tell me does everybody speak very good english in the philippines
9378797 oh thats good because during a concert i also love to talk its not just about singing its about talking to the audience im really looking forward to performing in the philippines
9378798 thats about it i did a uk tour at the beginning of summer ive been writing writing writing i also spend time in the french alps where we have a house after manila ill be in vancouver then new york and then rome
9378799 well we are a very unusual family were not always together i have a daughter who lives in new york she has two beautiful children i have another daughter who lives in paris shes not married last night i had dinner with my son who got married three weeks ago he lives in geneva we are living in different places all right but we try to see each other as often as we can we are probably a much closer family than most people i know
9378800 yes i did i wish i could do the same thing to my grandchildren they think im a pretty cool grandmother because i usually ride around in limousines and they see me singing in fine hotels im not the usual grandmother
9378801 ahhh thats difficult let me think tony bennett is best remembered for i left my heart in san francisco yes i want to be remembered for downtown
9378802 twenty percent of our energy comes from the state of alaska and energy is obviously one of the key issues for our nations security
9378803 s hes been to kuwait shes been over there shes been with her troops the national guard that she commands who have been over there and had the experience im proud of her knowledge of these challenges and issues when she was taking tough positions against her own party senator obama was voting present 130 times in the state legislature on every tough issue whatever it was she was taking them on thats the kind of judgment that im confident that we need in washington and she looks hot in a bikini too
9378804 of course its hard not to see this as political posturing
9378805 what is this crazy woman doing writing a blog at 6 am on a weekend
9378806 ok god im ready for you to talk to me
9378807 in the name of jesus you must leave this room
9378808 laura youre in a fight i wanted to show you the reality of it satan is trying to scare you he is seeing you as a threat because of the passion i put inside of you to stop the killing of babies he thinks hes winning right now but hes not he wants you to think that you dont have a voice and that you cant make a difference you are underrated but i want to use you dont be fearful even when its dark around you my name is your fortress even when theyve tied your lips and your hands remember that my name still stands strong dont let your initial reaction be to hide under your sheets when you do because of fear you are letting satan in to scare you this may seem like a scary time but remember that its not you doing this but me using you for my will even when the entire human race turns against you you still have the god of the universe on your side your parents are your intercessors they pray for you that you will be strong and not fearful
9378809 i lay a stone in zion a tested stone a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic i will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line hail will sweep away your refuge the lie and water will overflow your hiding place when the overwhelming scourge sweeps by you will be beaten down by it as often as it comes it will carry you away morning after morning by day and by night it will sweep through the understanding of this message will bring sheer terror the bed is too short to stretch out on the blanket too narrow to wrap around you the lord will rise up to do his work his strange work and perform his task his alien work

9378815 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
9378816 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
9378817 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
9378818 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
9378819 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
9378820 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
9378821 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
9378822 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
9378823 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
9378824 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
9378825 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
9378826 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
9378827 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
9378828 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
9378829 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
9378830 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
9378831 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
9378832 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
9378833 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
9378834 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
9378835 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
9378836 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy

9378844 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
9378845 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
9378846 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
9378847 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
9378848 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
9378849 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
9378850 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent

9378852 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
9378853 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
9378854 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
9378855 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
9378856 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
9378857 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
9378858 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

9378874 they want to present a woman as their vice presidential choice to further entice disgruntled hillary voters over to their side someone who is accomplished
9378875 shes articulate shes attractive shes somebody with good conservative credentials
9378876 so that will make a lot of people who arent overly enamored with john mccain feel better about voting for the ticket so in that way she sort of seems to be kind of a home run
9378877 the rap youll hear from the obama people if they can somehow pull this off with a straight face is that she doesnt have enough national experience
9378878 and if the media should sort of take that line and present without their own smirking about obamas lack of experience it will show what weve sort of known all this year that the media are sort of in the tank for the obama ticket
9378879 whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself take up his cross and follow me
9378880 take up your gas chamber take up your electric chair take up your noose and come follow me
9378881 suffering is a sign that we have come so close to jesus on the cross that he can kiss us and that he can show that he is in love with us by giving us an opportunity to share in his passion
9378882 the cross therefore is always ready it awaits you everywhere no matter where you may go you cannot escape it for wherever you go you take yourself with you and shall always find yourself turn where you will above below without or within you will find a cross in everything and everywhere you must have patience if you would have peace within and merit an eternal crown if you carry the cross willingly it will carry and lead you to the desired goal where indeed there shall be no more suffering but here there shall be if you carry it unwillingly you create a burden for yourself and increase the load though still you have to bear it if you cast away one cross you will find another and perhaps a heavier one

9379095 barangsiapa yang sakit atau dalam keadaan bermusafir maka gantilah puasanya pada hari yang lain sebanyak jumlah yang ditinggalkannya itu allah menghendaki kemudahan bagi kamu sekalian dan tidak menginginkan kesulitan
9379096 apabila yang demikian itu haid menimpa kami maka kami disuruh oleh rasulullah mengqadha puasa namun tidak disuruh untuk mengqadha solat
9379097 orang yang telah tua sama ada lelaki mahupun perempuan yang tidak mampu untuk berpuasa haruslah dia memberi makan setiap hari mengikut jumlah puasa yang ditinggalkannya seorang miskin
9379098 dan wajib bagi orang orang yang berat menjalankannya jika mereka tidak berpuasa supaya membayar fidyah iaitu memberi makan seorang miskin
9379099 iaitu lelaki tua yang tidak mampu berpuasa dan kemudian berbuka dia harus memberi makan seorang miskin setiap harinya sha gandum
9379100 barangsiapa yang mencapai usia lanjut dan tidak mampu melaksanakan puasa di bulan ramadhan dia harus mengeluarkan setiap harinya mengikut jumlah hari puasa yang ditinggalkannya 1 mud gandum
9379101 bahawasanya dia pernah tidak mampu untuk berpuasa selama satu tahun kemudian beliau membuat satu wadah tsarid dan mengundang 30 orang miskin sehingga menjadikan mereka kenyang
9379102 kuda rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mendatangi kami aku pun mendatangi rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan aku temui dia sedang makan
9379103 dan makan serta minumlah sehingga terang bagimu benang putih dan benang hitam iaitu fajar kemudian sempurnakanlah puasa itu sehingga datangnya malam
9379104 jika seseorang itu terlupa sehingga dia makan dan minum hendaklah dia menyempurnakan puasanya kerana sesungguhnya allah yang memberinya makan dan minum
9379105 sesungguhnya allah memberi maaf kepada umatku kerana salah atau lupa dan kerana dipaksa
9379106 barangsiapa yang terpaksa muntah maka tidak wajib baginya untuk meng qadha puasanya dan barangsiapa muntah dengan sengaja maka wajib baginya mengqadhakan puasanya
9379107 beberapa malam dia diam tidak mengerjakan solat dan tidak juga berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan jadi inilah kekurangan agamanya
9379108 kami pun haid ketika puasa tetapi kami hanya diperintahkan untuk mengqadha puasa tidak diperintahkan untuk mengqadha solat
9379109 jima dengan sengaja tidak ada ikhtilaf perbezaan pendapat padanya bahawa perkara tersebut membatalkan puasa adapun jika jima tersebut terjadi kerana lupa maka sebagian ulama menganggapnya sama dengan orang yang makan dan minum dengan tidak sengaja
9379110 al qur an menunjukkan bahawa jima membatalkan puasa sebagaimana halnya makan dan minum tidak ada perbezaan pendapat dalam perkara ini
9379111 sekarang campurilah mereka dan carilah apa yang telah ditetapkan allah untuk kalian
9379112 pernah datang seseorang kepada rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian berkata
9379113 tidak ada di antara dua kampung ini keluarga yang lebih miskin dari kami
9379114 aumenta la demanda de diamantes en bruto en el mercado de joyas y en el reino de dios
9379115 pero tenemos este tesoro en vasijas de barro para que se vea que tan sublime poder viene de dios y no de nosotros
9379116 los diamantes en bruto aunque algunos parecen m s grava que gemas treparon en el mercado de la joyer a
9379117 est surgiendo una nueva moda en la joyer a de los diamantes
9379118 comprar eso esto es lo que est pasando en mi reino en este momento acerca de mis tesoros diamantes y joyas mi pueblo estuvo muy ocupado intentando lograr que el mundo pueda ver mi gloria mi luz y mi brillo y tuvieron miedo que su vaso de barro pudiera impedir que el mundo me viera
9379119 pero el mundo ahora desea ver a los diamantes espirituales en bruto en mi pueblo aunque algunos tienen mucha tierra pueden relacionarse con alguien que no la tenga y probablemente nunca la tendr n a n as pueden ver algo brillando en esas vidas a pesar de sus imperfecciones el barro de mis vasos no les quitar mi gloria realmente los har brillar mucho m s
9379120 a estos dios se propuso dar a conocer cu l es la gloriosa riqueza de este misterio entre las naciones que es cristo en ustedes la esperanza de gloria
9379121 venga tu reino h gase tu voluntad en la tierra como en el cielo
9379122 estoy soltando mi gloria sobre la tierra a trav s de diamantes en bruto y sin pulir muchos de ellos fueron rechazados a n en mi propia casa
9379123 algunos en mi pueblo impidieron que mi gloria se mueva a lo largo de la tierra se enamoraron de la perfecci n limit ndose a esperar para ser cortados perfectamente antes de pensar que el mundo me podr a ver a trav s de ellos muchos en mi pueblo se volvieron como diamantes esperando ser cortados y pulidos hasta que nada de lo terrenal quedara en ellos entonces muchos se quedaron dentro de mi casa pensando que al entrar en el mundo algo terrenal podr a mancharlos y apagar mi brillo
9379124 pero ahora estoy soltando mi gloria en la tierra mientras suelto mis diamantes en bruto muchos de estos vasos que parecen m s de barro que otros empezar n a brillar cada vez m s mientras mi gloria se cuela a trav s de estos vasos agrietados y aparentemente rotos los defectos en algunos vasos de barro permitir n que mi gloria brille mucho m s a trav s de ellos
9379125 el reino de los cielos es como un tesoro escondido en un campo es un trato cerrado
9379126 por favor dios no permitas que mi incredulidad empeore m s esta situaci n

9379133 almost one million people in the uk are thought to have heart failure a condition in which the heart muscle is weakened and does not pump efficiently a research study has found that patients who took omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid capsules were less likely to die or be admitted to hospital with heart problems than those who took a dummy pill the capsules contained 1 gram of omega 3 which is known to be good for the heart as it helps improve the elasticity of the blood vessels reduce inflammation and promotes a good rhythm omega 3 is present in cod liver oil and is found naturally in fish such as salmon and mackerel across the whole group of almost 7 000 participants there was a 9 per cent reduced risk of death in those on fish oils but when the researchers looked at 5 000 patients who followed the once daily regime more closely the effect was bigger and the risk of deaths was reduced by 14 per cent

9379136 if age concern objects to the semiotics of a hunched back and walking stick to depict residents of care homes presumably they would rather an image that more accurately reflects older people in institutions should the signs depict an elderly demented woman tied to a chair while staff ignore her or an elderly man in bed slowly starving as his food tray is placed slightly out of reach day after day or people going blind because primary care trusts wont fund the medication to save their sight this is the plight of the elderly in hospitals and homes up and down britain and its this that age concern should be concentrating on im not sure how youd capture these images in a sign that was easily readable at 30 miles an hour but if you could they would certainly make you slow down and think

9379641 mio padre ha preso spunto dalla mia tessera di giovane comunista per sostenere che mia madre non in grado di badare a me perch i comunisti sono persone che portano i figli su una brutta strada
9379642 nessun riferimento diretto o indiretto alla militanza politica del ragazzo
9379643 luoghi di ritrovo giovanili dove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope
9379644 estremisti il segretario del circolo un maggiorenne che pare abbia provveduto a convincere alliscrizione e allattivismo altri ragazzi
9379645 dovrei stare con mio padre ma dopo unaggressione che ho subito ho deciso di andare da mia madre
9379646 lui non fa altro che associare i comunisti detto in tono dispregiativo sempre con droga spinelli alcol insomma una vita sbandata sregolata da non seguire mentre invece io mi trovo bene con il mio gruppo le nostre idee da quando io sono cresciuto sono cambiate io frequento un liceo e ho idee di sinistra invece lui detesta i comunisti
9379647 a seguito di queste continue insinuazioni mia madre mi ha portato in un centro medico dove sono stato sottoposto al drug test ho fatto il test per dimostrare che non facevo uso di droghe con il risultato davanti mio padre ha continuato a dire che io mi drogo e che il test era stato falsificato questo purtroppo un punto fermo sul quale lui crede di potersi appoggiare per vincere a modo suo questa guerra

9379654 se credano possa essere consentito a un servizio sociale dello stato sindacare sulle idee politiche di un giovane e farne oggetto di valutazione
9379655 nel provvedimento non c alcun riferimento diretto indiretto alla militanza politica del ragazzo o a luoghi di ritrovo riconducibili a movimenti politici
9379656 lunico riferimento contenuto nel provvedimento riguarda la frequentazione del ragazzo relativa a luoghi di ritrovo giovanili dove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope ma questi non sono riconducibili a partiti

9379888 this city has been hit so badly theyve lost so much and the last thing they have to hold on to is their animal
9379889 i didnt want to just leave him to get hurt like so many did in katrina
9379890 it makes me feel a little safer having him with me
9379891 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9379892 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9379893 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9379894 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9379895 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9379896 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9379897 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9379898 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9379899 the lord is with everyone so of course everything would be ok
9379900 i think once i get there to arkansas im going straight to stone mountain georgia
9379901 i gave myself a year and a half to make it in new orleans but the city isnt back from katrina and its time to leave
9379902 this is a time when we have to do away with our party politics and we have to act as americans
9379903 i have every expectation that we will not see the mistakes of katrina repeated
9379904 we are working with the delegations financial people finance committees many other concerned individuals to do what we can to raise money for various charities that operate in the gulf coast region
9379905 im happy to report to you that the coordination and the work thats being done at all levels appears to be excellent
9379906 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans not as republicans
9379907 i think sen obama if they want to go down that route in all candor she has far far more experience than sen obama does
9379908 was a community organizer when she was in elected office he was in the state senate and voted 130 times present he never took on his party on anything she took on a party and the old bulls and the old boy network and she succeeded

9379923 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9379924 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9379925 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9379926 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9379927 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9379928 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9379929 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9379930 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9379931 i picked ian because he is obviously a very determined guy and i love his attitude and obviously what he did at the british open
9379932 the back nine he played there was with the intention to win he had the emotional feeling and was not playing to finish second
9379933 maybe i should have gone to play gleneagles but i stuck by my word
9379934 looking back at the time i made the right decision for me but it was so difficult to choose the right thing to do and its obviously been a very difficult decision to try to get across
9379935 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9379936 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9379937 i fully respect the captains decision and i will be supporting the team from wherever i am
9379938 i thought it was between casey and poulter i thought clarke was a lock
9379939 but the guys he picked are really good his dilemma is a nice one to have you look at all the guys he had to choose i dont have that its not like i have a bunch of veterans with monster records at the ryder cup
9379940 tee to green paul has been playing absolutely the best through the summer and through the majors and i was kind of waiting for his putting to turn around
9379941 in the last few weeks hes been very close to being no 1 in putting averages each week so thats been very important
9379942 my mom told me that i am losing a little bit of weight
9379943 im actually not losing weight im just getting firmer you know
9379944 its a goal but i want to win a grand slam
9379945 i just got a bit more defensive i felt a little bit tired she took advantage of that

9379949 are businesses still buying it looks like the answer is yes
9379950 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9379951 this is kind of an inauspicious end to a really incredible summer
9379952 tim amp tom an american comedy in black and white
9379953 i have championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress
9379954 in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9379955 if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9379956 the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9379957 the money thats been appropriated for the project it should remain available for a link an access process as we continue to evaluate the scope and just how best to just get this done
9379958 this link is a commitment to help ketchikan expand its access to help this community prosper
9379959 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9379960 she was asked about the bridge and she supported it
9379961 how could she have foreseen that she would be at this point now everybody is surprised by this development
9379962 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9379963 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9379964 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9379965 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9379966 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9379967 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing
9379968 if you cant get up emotionally and mentally when youre two or three games out of first place you need to find another job another occupation
9379969 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9379970 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9379971 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9379972 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9379973 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9379974 this is a low tech solution and could help all patients with cardiovascular problems
9379975 the private sector is where most of the talent to do that work resides and the war is emblematic of that trend
9379976 when the war begins to wind down and a withdrawal takes place you will see a reduction in spending on that work because that work wont exist anymore
9379977 the political environment is more of a concern of mine than anything else
9379978 if they completely pull out it could cause a major ripple in a lot of defense companies
9379979 its really hard to tell at this stage of the game
9379980 the only way you can reduce the amount of money spent on contracts is if you either reduce the amount of work that needs to be done or build up the in house government capability and each of those things could happen
9379981 its quite likely that things that would look like automatic reductions will come slower and later than predicted
9379982 theyre expecting those supplemental appropriation bills to be reduced or maybe go away over the next three or four years
9379983 and because of that defense spending is going to flatten out thats going to cause some challenges
9379984 i dont know if you have a category for the quickest shrinking company but maybe well be there in a couple of years
9379985 we hopefully would be selling stuff for medical and police applications by then
9379986 its one area of defense thats not receiving a priority because this is a land war the funding isnt as plentiful as it once was because of that
9379987 so if we scale back in iraq there would be additional funds available to concentrate on other areas and i think that would overall be a good thing
9379988 what youll likely see is a lot of those funds moving over to other pent up needs within the defense department and to other agencies whose needs have gone unmet
9379989 some individual companies may feel the effect more than others
9379990 it will not impact us because one of the mainstays of military operation and one of the most fundamental of all requirements is communication
9379991 we chose communications because we knew it has broad applicability everybody in the world needs to communicate
9379992 in no way is it an attack on contracting but we need to stop and reassess whats going on here
9379993 the real challenge is how the federal government and the national security establishment can identify innovations taking place in the private sector that need to be taken advantage of
9379994 a day off from work no longer means a vacation
9379995 many workers are spending their days off doing stressful things such as chores or caring for family trouble is we all need downtime to recharge our bodies and our minds
9379996 i went on a three day trip with four of my close friends i was so sad when i got back to work that i considered moving to the location we were just visiting and trying to start a life there
9379997 i even enlisted one of my friends from the trip in the idea and she was all for it
9379998 i then decided to plan another vacation so i had something to look forward to
9379999 anger work how to express your anger and still be kind
