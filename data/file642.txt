6420003 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6420004 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6420005 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6420006 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6420007 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6420008 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6420009 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6420010 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6420011 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6420012 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6420013 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6420014 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6420015 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6420016 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6420017 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6420018 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6420019 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6420020 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6420021 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6420022 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6420023 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6420029 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6420030 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6420031 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6420032 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6420033 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
6420034 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
6420035 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them

6420052 when suddenly not only are you feeling more insecure with your job you cant get rising wages or rising incomes and the cost of everything from gas to food to healthcare to trying to send your children to college keeps on skyrocketing
6420053 when you find out that you lost your healthcare your pension or you never had it it turns out youre not the only one
6420054 millions of americans have been going through that same loss of security
6420055 these tend to be folks that relocate here they tend to be younger voters also folks who obviously based on their lifestyle would be open to the prescription for change sen obama is offering
6420056 barack obama can spend all the money in the world in some of these republican leaning states but he will still be the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the modern era and he will still have the most liberal record in the united states senate
6420057 he is more liberal than a lot of the state
6420058 its going to be a very difficult race for him in north carolina
6420059 he cant make any promises that are going to help us tomorrow
6420060 its going to be a long time coming out of this
6420061 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6420062 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them

6420068 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6420069 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6420070 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6420071 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6420072 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6420073 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6420074 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6420075 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6420076 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6420077 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6420078 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6420079 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6420080 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6420081 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6420082 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6420083 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6420084 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6420085 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6420086 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6420087 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6420088 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6420089 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6420090 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6420091 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6420092 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6420093 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6420094 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6420095 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6420096 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6420097 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6420098 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6420099 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6420100 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6420101 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6420102 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6420103 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6420104 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6420105 a guy came into the hospital and said you dont know me but i was one of those people you hauled out of the x ray
6420106 he said thanks for my life halfway down the trail to hell
6420107 we cannot let them say that we started this war
6420108 that the russians at the exact moment they are showering the press corps with this garbage are also emptying shrinvali of its inhabitants theyre massing troops and troop transports positioning fuel trucks on georgian soil and finally sending columns of tanks through the roky tunnel which separates the two ossetias now suppose you are the leader of the country and you hear this what do you do
6420109 after the hundred and fiftieth tank lines itself up facing your cities you are forced to admit that the war has begun and despite the disproportion in the forces opposing us you no longer have a choice
6420110 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6420111 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6420112 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6420113 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6420114 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6420115 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6420116 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6420117 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6420118 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6420119 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6420120 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6420121 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6420122 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6420123 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6420124 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6420125 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6420126 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6420127 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6420128 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6420129 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6420130 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6420131 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6420132 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6420133 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6420134 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6420135 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6420136 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6420137 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6420138 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6420139 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6420140 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6420141 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6420142 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6420143 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6420144 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6420145 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6420146 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6420147 each island we visited had its own special beauty we enjoyed snorkeling at tortuga bay where sea lions would swim around us and play we delighted in a coastal walk at st james bay viewing various shore birds followed by seeing collapsed lava tunnels that have become resting areas for galapagos fur seals we had a whale and dolphin search following our crossing of the equator sightings of pelicans blue footed boobie birds and frigate birds were numerous and wondrous
6420148 in preparing for a disney cruise i had some idea of what to expect a boatload of misbehaving children and parents i also expected the condition of the boat to be lower than my previous adult cruise i now know how wrong i was i loved the cruise the ship was great the staff was marvelous the destinations spectacular and the weather beyond belief the boat was clean and in great condition i returned after a 4 day bahamas cruise completely rested and relaxed and would like to apologize to all the kids and parents i failed to give credit to
6420149 particularly enjoyable was the onboard naturalist in this case a cambridge professor with a lifetime spent in the polar regions his lectures packed the large theater to the point that it was standing room only and even then it was worth the discomfort to hear his firsthand and often humorous tales of the history politics and wildlife of antarctica it was far more education than i expected and it highly embellished and deepened my appreciation not only for what i was seeing but also my admiration for those brave if not insane early explorers to this incredibly remote place
6420150 unlike a lot of todays mega ships that host thousands of people at a time the wind surf is a 5 mast 7 sail motor sail yacht and youll share her with about 300 other passengers the crew was outstanding and fellow passengers were friendly and interesting all in all a terrific value for the cruise fare it really was one of the best vacations weve had in a long time and were trying to convince friends to cruise with us on windstar next winter
6420151 the best cruise ship entertainment that ive experienced great views from anywhere in the showroom and the singers dancers and costumes are broadway quality for dinner serenity continues the tradition of assigned tables at two seatings but there are other venues for those desiring more choice silk road is crystals asian restaurant overseen by nobu what a treat the decor is sleek the menu incredible and you will recognize all of nobus signature dishes the sushi bar as you enter always has two nobu chefs from one of the restaurants in attendance
6420152 instead of going from hotel to hotel and spending hours of time flying from island to island we went on the norwegian cruise line we were able to go to five different islands without ever having to pack up our bags one of the most memorable parts of the cruise was getting to meet the other passengers and the crew the crew always aimed to please and they had a lot of interesting stories we loved the service the food the drinks and the entertainment without a doubt this is the way to experience the aloha state
6420153 we got a really great deal on an obstructed ocean view stateroom so we decided to go for it we departed from seattle for seven nights sailing the inside passage of alaska the ship had plenty of areas where you could sit and watch the glaciers or mountains if you did not want to go outside my mother and i loved to bundle up in blankets and go out on the back deck to watch everything i wouldnt hesitate to recommend the diamond princess to anyone planning to take a cruise the crew were wonderful and the food was really good as well
6420154 imagine sailing on a schooner among fjords remote islands waterfalls and amazing wildlife while eating gourmet cuisine and being with a naturalist this nine day holiday blew my mind not a traditional cruise nine guests sleeping in bunks but to experience the wilderness in comfort this is heaven definitely take a turn steering the ship and definitely go out on the bowsprit
6420155 we actually paid about 25 of the published fare for a penthouse deck cabin with a veranda on the beautiful liner millennium after boarding the ship which was made extremely easy for us by celebrity we sailed to dubrovnik in croatia and had a days excursion there at civitavecchia the seaport of rome we decided to stay aboard and enjoy the wonderful swimming pool and the aqua spa on the top deck not to mention the excellent food and cold drinks and ice cream wed been to rome many times and the temperature was in the 90s
6420156 he went out on friday night with two mates he was just waiting for a taxi when a group came up and asked him for a cigarette
6420157 he didnt have one thats what he said before he collapsed
6420158 apparently there are witnesses and we just want them to come forward so we know how this happened
6420159 he just deteriorated i tried to wake him but he got agitated and shouted get off me leave me alone
6420160 why dont you chat with your fans for a minute im going to go yell at some people
6420161 hi im jamie chambers a writer and game designer with margaret weis productions and this is the disembodied head of filmmaker and actress felicia day
6420162 over the years i have had a few replies usually from norway or denmark
6420163 i have never had one from st andrews and never one that has taken this long to wash up
6420164 the message in a bottle was really quite a find and surprised us all and were delighted to be able to reunite the owner with this piece of history
6420165 at the beginning it was very frightening because of the bombs because of the guns there were always people being killed for a young man it was very frustrating
6420166 i live with that frustration and i remember everything and i have those images and pictures in my head
6420167 the actors attended the classes and made friendships with the students
6420168 they wanted to get closer to their life situation and what we found was very shocking and devastating in some cases
6420169 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
6420170 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
6420171 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore
6420172 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6420173 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6420174 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6420175 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6420176 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6420177 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6420178 giving only scotland a say on independence negates the existence of britain
6420179 worth a look it is however recommended by matthew dancona
6420180 on the internet i keep in touch with opendemocracy a website on global current affairs and its useful offshoot ourkingdom
6420181 the generosity and the kindness is unbelievable every one is so sweet and nice all the comments are pure love
6420182 people that wear them clothes like that is making our city look bad
6420183 its not only black boys its white boys and hispanic boys too
6420184 you can express yourself in a different manner than pulling your pants down
6420185 they say theres a law against indecent exposure well thats indecent exposure when you show your back part with underwear
6420186 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6420187 puente llaguno memoria de un pueblo con sed de justicia
6420188 es inaceptable que la libertad de movimiento de nuestro embajador haya sido obstaculizada se lo hemos hecho saber a las autoridades rusas
6420189 its a group of humble girls that doesnt focus on that we dont have the biggest gym or the most money within the school
6420190 theyre very proud to be from minneapolis southwest and that fuels the fire for them to compete even stronger i know these girls want to make a statement
6420191 but really once everything got going those wayzata girls were just so much more consistent than we were its nothing we cant take though and i think that match last year gave us a lot more confidence
6420192 it would be so cool to go back there and show them that even though were from the city we can compete and win
6420193 it would be amazing i would love it and i really think its going to happen
6420194 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6420195 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6420196 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6420197 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6420198 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6420199 jedehandlung des sohnes von adam geh rt ihm selbst au er dem fasten esist mein und ich werde ihn daf r entlohnen das fasten ist ein schutz wenn einer von euch fastet soll er weder obsz n noch zu laut sprechen und wenn ihn jemand beleidigt oder herausfordert dann soll er sagen ich faste bei dem in dessen hand die seele von muhammad ist deratem desjenigen der fastet ist bei allah genehmer als der duft vonmoschus der fastende hat zwei freuden wenn er sein fasten bricht erholt er sich und wenn er seinem herren gegen bersteht hat er freudean seinem fasten

6420209 i was wondering if you think that foreign films if they had been made in english with no other differences would manage to find a broad audience in the us i dont think so because of culture shock the actors that we want the most often in the us outside of americans are of course the british because of the language similarities but the british culture is very different from ours and even then it could be a hard time making a translation i think it would be really hard to translate french italian chinese or japanese culture to a broad audience here what do you think
6420210 i agree there are some movies if they were made in english they would do rather well but even then they would need some kind of adjustment it would be different the stars are different there is different attitudes towards life although i do sometimes observe that there are some english language movies were they subtitled would actually get great reviews from critics but because they are not subtitled people dont appreciate them because they are american but even though just doing a direct translation would be in most cases a little bit of a jolt the english they have a different culture but their values the way of looking at life is much more similar to ours than the way the italians look at life and certainly the way the french look at life i mean when you travel on the continent and then when you go the england for a couple days and it almost feel like youre home it really does and its not just because theyre speaking english they dont stop to work at 2 oclock in the afternoon for 4 hours for absolutely no reason and they just have a different way to look at life that is more similar to ours
6420211 gibson through the lens offers music fans around the world the opportunity to witness an exhibition of iconic pictures that symbolizes and represents the heart and soul of gibson and epiphone guitar through the ages these images are evidence of the deep routed history high regard and quality of our guitars that are played by the worlds leading artists i am proud to be staging this exhibition for the first time in the us at the sunset marquis hotel and villas because of its long standing rock n roll history
6420212 the sunset marquis hotel and villas has a long standing relationship with the music world many of whom called the hotel home early in their careers and continue to do so to this day
6420213 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6420214 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6420215 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6420216 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6420217 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6420218 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6420219 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6420220 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6420221 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6420222 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6420223 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

6420226 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6420227 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6420228 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6420229 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6420230 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6420231 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6420232 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6420233 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6420234 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6420235 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6420236 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6420237 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6420238 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6420239 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6420240 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6420241 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6420242 we werent as aggressive in the very early days as we probably could have been i think we didnt realize all we had to offer i think we lost a lot of opportunities in the very early days not recognizing what was there
6420243 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6420244 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6420245 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6420246 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6420247 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6420248 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6420249 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6420250 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension

6420256 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6420257 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6420258 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6420259 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6420260 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6420261 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6420262 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6420263 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6420264 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6420265 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6420266 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6420267 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6420268 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6420269 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6420270 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6420271 no it wont happen to me it may happen to someone else but it wont happen to me
6420272 how i wish i have bought that health insurance policy how i wished id looked into health insurance sooner
6420273 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6420274 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6420275 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6420276 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6420277 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6420278 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6420279 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6420280 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6420281 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6420282 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6420283 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6420284 everybody i talk to say theyve heard that apple valleys not going to be any good this year
6420285 but this first week has looked pretty good for us its been real pleasant we have some skill players and even though were pretty much starting over were pretty excited about this year
6420286 most teams dont finish in the top half of their conference
6420287 im asked what the secret is and i joke that its good coaching but the staff here really is a bunch of soccer junkies and this never gets old
6420288 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6420289 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6420290 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6420291 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6420292 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6420293 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6420294 it is not true the lawyer and his defendant refused to sign the authorization they just were never asked
6420295 the truth behind the armed conflict will never be known
6420296 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6420297 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6420298 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6420299 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6420300 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6420301 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6420302 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6420303 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6420304 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6420305 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6420306 i can be as cruel as you fighting fire with firewood
6420307 you get sadder the smarter you get and its a bore
6420308 at my attraction we are constantly being pressured to be efficient
6420309 start each day with a smile and get over it
6420310 the overall process is likely to be a four week process
6420311 they may be waiting for some major announcement to come along before making a splash with this like maybe a google android device they want to support
6420312 theyd want to announce this with something big although they need to announce something soon
6420313 we now look forward to building in the year ahead we will continue to build on the work we have been doing around the narc campaign and to spread the republican message to young people in the area the spirit of republican youth is definitely still alive in lurgan
6420314 we want to engage with our local community in the year ahead and build on the positive work of sinn f in and gra to date we remain committed to building and spreading the republican message to young people and i am looking forward to the year ahead for gra shinn f in in upper bann

6420324 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6420325 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6420326 what happens if people realize i have no idea what im talking about
6420327 financial institutions or creditors that are subject to new and changing regulations should view red flags detection as a means to an end of achieving overall enhanced information security and it security governance
6420328 a holistic view of information security and red flag detection helps align it investment with business objectives securing customer data transactions and identities and improve customer confidence
6420329 identity theft red flags and address discrepancies under the fair and accurate credit transactions act facta of 2003
6420330 while most companies have some form of fraud prevention or data security in place the facta red flags guidelines require financial institutions and creditors in the united states to do more by making senior management accountable to its board of directors for implementing measures that prevent detect and respond to identity theft events occurring within their organization

6420383 in selecting connectivity partners global crossing stood out for a number of reasons in what was a highly competitive bidding process
6420384 global crossing was extremely cost competitive has excellent project management skills and the strength of its network has helped us expand our high speed broadband and stronger converged voice and data offerings to 99 percent of the uk population
6420385 in addition we already had a long standing successful relationship based on a high level service level agreement which gave us complete confidence in global crossings ability to consistently deliver superior quality network support
6420386 todays businesses demand more robust and resilient connectivity as they face increasing communications challenges in linking with a greater number of offices and remote workers as well as sharing greater volumes of ip data and voice traffic
6420387 like us entanet has a well deserved reputation for driving leading edge technology solutions that directly meet todays customer needs as a result of this strategic partnership isps and resellers can secure competitive advantage by providing a broader range of faster more stable and cost effective connectivity solutions
6420388 in what is a strategically important move for the company we have made a significant investment in our own network allowing us to take wbc
6420389 as part of our 21cn infrastructure development a key goal was to improve delivery enabling channel customers to offer more stable and potentially faster adsl2 broadband as well as broader quality of service options for those end users looking to prioritise traffic

6420405 that is what had me worried when one of the health workers passed around spraying he said shereen was not looking well and i should take her to the doctor
6420406 thats when she told me that it sounded like dengue but even when i went to the nursing home the doctor told me i did not look like i had dengue
6420407 they admitted me one time because they said my platelet level was dropping i stayed for four days and i received seven bags of drips i am feeling better but im still weak
6420408 children give legitimacy to what they hear on radio especially if their parents also listen to these shows
6420409 a lot of work has to be done and eyewitnesses interviewed
6420410 i think it is too early to judge the response of ttec the communications manager did indicate that when the wire fell the pole fuse should have tripped and they will have to find out why the wire was still live when it fell
6420411 we have to wait until ttec has examined the fuse and the lines and we hope they will explain what caused this near tragedy
6420412 we are working seven days a week and we are trying to keep within the budget 500 million we have had some challenges in respect to the site work but by july we will tell you exactly how much it cost
6420413 the minister called today yesterday and asked me to accept his sympathy all the time he saying she did not die from dengue he never called when she died he said he would call back but he hasnt done so to this time
6420414 for a child in her condition it is normal for her to experience fever and aches and pain so it was normal for them doctors to carry out blood tests for her existing condition
6420415 i am not sure why my son was killed because i am hearing a lot of things
6420416 look i was just told that he had an argument on saturday with somebody
6420417 sterling was a cool going fella but i think that he just got mixed up with the wrong set of people

6420419 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name
6420420 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6420421 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6420422 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
6420423 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market
6420424 her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6420425 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years
6420426 alot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen
6420427 due to her faithful service and contribution to the association and for her exceptional professionalism and experience in real estate
6420428 um no its not your birthday or christmas or even martin luther king day theres no good reason to rush right out and buy something new

6420469 when someone loves you the way they say your name is different you just know that your name is safe in their mouth
6420470 love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other

6420473 love is when you kiss all the time then when you get tired of kissing you still want to be together and you talk more my mommy and daddy are like that they look gross when they kiss
6420474 love is whats in the room with you at christmas if you stop opening presents and listen
6420475 if you want to learn to love better you should start with a friend who you hate
6420476 love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt then he wears it everyday
6420477 love is like a little old woman and a little old man who are still friends even after they know each other so well
6420478 during my piano recital i was on a stage and i was scared i looked at all the people watching me and saw my daddy waving and smiling he was the only one doing that i wasnt scared anymore
6420479 my mommy loves me more than anybody you dont see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night

6420516 ecco il problema di chi beve pensai versandomi da bere
6420517 molto deludenti avevo sperato davvero che la gestione veltroni significasse lapertura di una stagione nuova della politica italiana invece la sudditanza psicologica e politica del pd verso le frange giustizialiste sconcertante
6420518 credo di non essere il solo deluso in questo da veltroni aggiunge credo che altrettanto delusi siano molti dei suoi sostenitori lunica cosa di cui mi sono pentito continua il premier forse di aver dato troppo credito alla speranza di dialogo e a questa speranza non ho voluto rinunciare sino allultimo peccato per la sinistra e per la democrazia italiana
6420519 sono come sempre contraddittori e francamente lesercizio di decifrarli non mi appassiona pi di tanto dico solo che per dialogare bisogna essere in due e che il rapporto deve essere improntato a una lealt e a un rispetto che francamente non vedo dallaltra parte so comunque che nellopposizione ci sono molte persone responsabili interessate quanto noi a riformare profondamente questo paese
6420520 certamente e inevitabilmente sottolinea berlusconi ma non voglio credere che il pd si sottrarr davvero ad un confronto serio su questi temi certificherebbe la morte del suo progetto riformista e si troverebbe paradossalmente a fare da ruota di scorta a di pietro a grillo ai girotondini
6420521 we have come from no where and we have no where to go
6420522 we do not have to die to reach the kingdom in fact we have to be really alive
6420523 and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges

6420530 its not restricted to a particular issue or particular age group or segment of the population as long as they are viewed by authorities as potential troublemakers there is this pretty relentless effort to silence or otherwise neutralize the form of dissent

6420533 good article but for your information you are a little late
6420534 during his lifetime no persons were described as jews anywhere that fact is supported by theology history and science in none of the manuscripts of the original old or new testament was jesus described or referred to as a jew the term originated in the late eighteenth century
6420535 the religious sect in judea in the time of jesus to which self styled jews today refer to as jews were known as pharisees judaism today and pharisaism in the time of jesus are the same

6420580 the data paint a fascinating picture of the manner in which emerging technology has re shaped the attitudes and behavior of contemporary travelers
6420581 and it is clear that tech savvy travelers display a significantly different market profile than travelers who are less wired
6420582 the implications of this work for marketers of travel services are quite profound
6420583 they not only suggest the need for a fresh approach to media strategies that will reach this growing audience but raise provocative questions about the influence of the user generated content that is now flourishing online
6420584 it is very interesting to see what is happening throughout the sector certain geographic regions are continuing to grow whilst others are experiencing closer scrutiny as to whether travel is necessary
6420585 we are seeing the credit crunch wave starting to effect the aspac region however in todays global marketplace organizations realise that a certain amount of travel is essential and important
6420586 what is becoming more apparent is that companies are paying more attention to the reason behind a trip there is no question that clients understand the business benefits of face to face meetings but increasingly they are opting to consider and offer alternative solutions whether that is best fare on the day or a teleconference
6420587 although not mandatory we are seeing certain companies asking us to offer their travellers a video conference alternative at the time they request a flight booking there is also a trend towards webinars and a return to video conferences for internal meetings
6420588 although transatlantic routes are feeling the brunt of the current financial situation we are seeing growth in the emerging markets
6420589 this is particularly apparent in the middle east and africa
6420590 our clients appreciate the stability of their preferred carriers realising that they are going through difficult times and supporting them to ensure that certain routes which may be at risk of cancellation as airlines prepare their winter schedules will remain available
6420591 there is also a trend for corporates to avoid booking highly restrictive fares and preferring where possible to select the lowest mid range fare which has flexibility rather than choose a low cost carrier option with full cancellation penalties
6420592 theres a huge potential for clients to achieve greater value from their investment in corporate travel an average 13 per cent saving per ticket by using our global pricing desk
6420593 more companies particularly smaller national clients are opting to take advantage of hrgs own fares as they are not able to generate the necessary volume to negotiate their own route or airline deals
6420594 it is more important than ever for companies to take full advantage of the services offered by a corporate travel management provider as they are fully experienced in maximising return on expenditure and offering alternative options to meet individual requirements
6420595 fall is shaping up to be a strong season for tripadvisor travelers and even a modest drop at the gas pump fuels their enthusiasm
6420596 a decision to open 10 new hotels has been taken at the annual general meeting of the company held in kolkata earlier today although no discussion took place regarding the investment modalities the meeting took note of modalities like the room capacity and ownership structure for the new hotels
6420597 we will have under the oberoi brand one city hotel at dubai two one city and a leisure in abu dhabi and one city in muscat in oman
6420598 while the drop in u s transaction volume is pronounced it is not far below the volume recorded in the first half of 2004 and 2005 the full year 2008 u s volume is expected to come in somewhat below the 2004 total in the range of 10 to 12 billion
6420599 reits gained the most ground on the acquisition front in the first half of 2008 and were the largest net buyer of hotel assets reflecting a shift from debt driven transactions to more traditional real estate investment deals
6420600 european investors bought eight u s hotels in the first half of 2008 in transactions amounting to 533 6 million indicative of foreign investors interest in assets in u s gateway markets
6420601 individual deal size also decreased through mid 2008 five single asset sales exceeded the 100 million mark down from 19 in the first half of 2007
6420602 nevertheless as evidenced by the successful execution of several high quality deals the markets are indeed open and appetite remains among lenders for well sponsored assets in good locations

6420613 were trying to get the nerve tissue to integrate with a device to grow into it to form a better connection
6420614 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
6420615 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6420616 our strong pipeline in the country now features 23 hotels with more than 6 700 rooms if we look at russia and all further cis countries all together we even reach 35 hotels with more than 9 200 rooms in operation and under development

6420717 my administration views with every seriousness the rate at which crimes are committed and has therefore decided to leave no stone unturned at ensuring that crime rate in the state is drastically reduced the issue of security in the state has to be fought headlong and with all seriousness it deserves as men of the underworld seem to be having an upperhand while the security men are constrained because of lack of adequate security equipment to fight the dare devil robbers
6420718 let me at this juncture warn hoodlums and men of the underworld that they should flee oyo state and find their abode elsewhere as from now the state will be made uncomfortable for them as full scale war will be waged against them by the combined forces of security agencies in the state let me also appeal to all the good citizens of this state to volunteer to the police and other security agencies like the army the state security services information which will lead to the arrest of the men of the underworld they live within us and they should be exposed the police and other security agencies will treat every information given to them with absolute confidentiality i also wish to appeal to operators of hotels and clubs who give men of the underworld cover in their hotels to desist from such acts they should join hands with the government in ensuring that oyo state is safe for all and sundry

6420765 jenny cockell is an english author who in the mid 1990s came to fame for her book about reincarnation called
6420766 our concept of the past is sequential its possible your past is affecting your present
6420767 when weve done past life regressions weve discovered the human can communicate historic data graphically and accurately the person hypnotized has never been exposed to this historic information
6420768 another thing weve found is that youre probably interacting with many people who were important to you in the past incarnation people seem to be reborn in another time frame seek out each other and explore their relationships once more

6420770 i think everybody reincarnates because we have many lessons to learn lessons about love compassion charity nonviolence inner peace patience etc it would be hard to learn them all in only one life also some people come back voluntarily to help others

6420772 reincarnation is not always and not usually immediate the in between state may last a long time also our soul is far greater than our physical body it is not limited by our constructs of space and time

6420909 were very pleased that after a rewarding period of consultation with scottish teachers we have now launched these services
6420910 were rightly proud of our education system but its distinctive nature as well as scotlands unique character inevitably means that the challenges faced by scottish teachers sometimes differ from the rest of the uk
6420911 im sure teacher support scotlands new services will make an invaluable contribution to the wellbeing of scottish teachers and thereby the education of scottish children
6420912 they have great terms and conditions a short working week and super holidays i am indeed married to a teacher and she found it hard at first but once the lesson plans etc are in place its much easier there are times when she has to work on but nothing like what i have to do in the private sector

6420977 gerrard was not playing on the left im sorry we played 4 3 2 1 we played jermain defoe gerrard and wayne rooney and three midfielders behind them
6420978 the position he had to play was between the line of the backs and the midfielders mr redknapp has to say something but he didnt play on the left sorry with his movement he went on the left and to the middle he moved but he never played on the left
6420979 im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good was important and i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together with different style
6420980 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on and the players fitness levels are still not at their best but i think well be ready for both the games next month
6420981 there was only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs had counter attacks we suffered
6420982 that was the problem we have to prepare something to combat that problem
6420983 i asked to play against them for this reason to see where the problems are they are not easy to beat
6420984 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6420985 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there and now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6420986 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6420987 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show

6421001 where teams are successful at the youth level you have also have good international teams
6421002 china should start again with the young players and not artificially hire a national coach and change it every year
6421003 there must be some continuity there must be a plan there must be short and long term planning
6421004 the organisation of the beijing olympics will give an impact to the development of football here but when youve seen your mens team going out in the first round then people are naturally not happy with them
6421005 it should have been a chance for chinese soccer to be honored but in the end it was dishonored what has gone wrong there
6421006 now chinese soccer is confronted with its biggest ever crisis our grassroots is withering our professional league is also spiralling downward and can produce few quality players
6421007 brian cowen on becoming taoiseach said that despite economic downturn his government is committed to the helping the most vulnerable in society
6421008 while the strategy contains many positive elements it is flawed as it contains no clear timelines responsibilities or funding allocations
6421009 the government is committed under the national partnership agreement to provide for the needs of 60 000 households between 2006 and 2009 they are also committed under the same agreement to provide 27 000 social houses and 17 000 affordable by 2009
6421010 judging by the department of environments own statistics the government is well behind on these targets with one prominent homelessness charity predicting that they will fall 40 or 25 000 houses short of their social and affordable targets to 2009
6421011 in march of this year i helped secure a declaration from the european parliament which commits the eu to ending street homelessness by 2015 at that time i had hoped that ireland would live up to its commitment to end homelessness by 2010 and set an example to the other member states

6421019 the quality in the premier league is simply better a lot better than what we were coming up against in the championship
6421020 we were warned about what davies was going to be doing but hes scored goals like that all his career we have to be smart about it
6421021 theres a fear factor about coming here and so there should be no team will come down here and take us lightly because they know about our reputation theyll have talked to other teams and know what theyre getting themselves in for so theyd better be up for it
6421022 but we can shock them too everyone thinks were just going to lump it up but weve got great passers all over like glenn whelan liam lawrence and ric fuller so weve got quality in there
6421023 villa got a great win last week but we have to believe that we can defend against them we have to believe that at home we can get a result

6421025 its going to be tough for us home or away but at home were going to put up one hell of a fight
6421026 abdoulaye has got that experience we played against him when he was at newcastle and hes a great defender that can only be good for the squad

6421186 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

6421191 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6421192 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6421196 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6421197 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6421198 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6421199 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6421200 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6421201 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6421202 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6421203 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6421204 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6421205 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6421206 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6421207 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6421208 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6421209 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6421210 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6421211 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6421212 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6421213 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6421214 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6421215 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6421216 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6421217 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6421218 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6421219 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6421220 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6421221 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6421222 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6421223 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6421224 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6421225 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6421226 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6421227 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6421228 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6421229 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6421230 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6421231 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6421232 isso ser muito ruim provocando quebra de confian a na ind stria automobil stica que j anunciou novos investimentos e at constru o de f bricas para atender a demanda do mercado

6421236 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6421237 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6421238 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6421239 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6421240 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts

6421258 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
6421259 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
6421260 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive

6421482 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6421483 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6421484 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6421485 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6421486 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6421487 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

6421489 sixty million indigenous peoples are dependent on forests for their livelihoods food and medicines
6421490 these people have already been severely impacted by deforestation if the value of their forests increases governments and corporations may be willing to go to extreme lengths to wrest forests away from indigenous peoples and others
6421491 delegates are focusing on finance but to stop deforestation land rights must be centre stage these un climate talks shamefully continue to take place without any meaningful participation by indigenous peoples
6421492 the us could say that it will only join a post kyoto agreement on condition that they it can offset emissions by buying deforestation credits it would be a catastrophe
6421493 it could crash the price of carbon and would mean the reduction of pollution in rich countries would be come quite uneconomic
6421494 these concerns are legitimate and need to be heard and respected we strongly support we have to learn from the past
6421495 without quick and robust investment in securing forest community rights these carbon markets will further marginalise the poorest of the poor

6421498 i think i speak for millions of people in the uk when i say we have been dazzled we have impressed we have been blown away by these but we have not been intimidated

6421500 but i feel very strongly that these games offer a fantastic opportunity for china to open up to the rest of the world and for china to understand how the rest of the world thinks about china
6421501 the announcement of our three 2009 national series schedules has some significant news in it
6421502 we think this news and these moves benefit all the industry including the tracks and the teams but most importantly our fans
6421503 you know theres just better cars better engines better everything everything just seems to be going our way now and were getting some breaks and doing things right in the shop not that we were doing them wrong before it just seems like everything is transferring over to finishes now
6421504 hopefully were hitting our stride at the right time and we can carry that into the next three weeks and hopefully onto the chase
6421505 it seems like everybody has closed the gap on the 18 kyle busch obviously theyve been running really good every week but it seems like the 99 carl edwards has been running really well all year
6421506 i feel like weve closed up the gap weve got a little bit more work to do to get to where we need to be but hopefully over the next three weeks we can get everything done that we need to get done on the racetrack and then really throw everything at it for the chase hopefully in an underdog role you dont really have anything to lose so thats hopefully what were looking forward to
6421507 i think theyve done a great job with the race track and just making some of the grooves the first time we went there i think the tires were a little bit too hard and you could run all the way up at the wall
6421508 the last time we went there it was more like the old bristol but you still had a couple options from the bottom to the middle i think once they got the tires squared away the race track kind of came back around and the racing was a lot more normal the last time
6421509 thats almost funny to hear somebody say that because i dont know that there is a tame race at bristol
6421510 i think if everybody is running over the top of each other people are going to complain about that
6421511 i learned from the very first race that you have to be around at the finish to do well at bristol
6421512 it really is a situation of surviving the first 400 laps keeping the fenders on the thing and staying out of the wall then if youre in good shape after four fifths of the race its time to really get down to business during the final 100 laps
6421513 this technology makes it possible to predict individuals responses to drugs and their risk of developing disease
6421514 it is an uphill battle but one that is worth fighting for considering the large contribution of the industry to the economy as a whole
6421515 it is critical to understand the importance of an auto industry as a key driver to an economy especially to one like ours the philippine automotive industry is perhaps one of only two remaining significant manufacturing efforts in the philippines
6421516 no successful developed country is without an auto industry that contributes significantly to its gross domestic product
6421517 there is clearly an opportunity for added expansion in the philippine market vis vis its asean neighbors given our low car ownership relative to population another potential for domestic market expansion
6421518 we want to encourage the philippines stronger integration within the asean supply chain which is not only feasible but can be a reality

6421527 die tiroler forschung amp entwicklung w chst rasant beispielhaft hat das land aufbauend auf die traditionell starke grundlagenforschung mit eigenmitteln in h he von 42 8 mio eur optimale strukturen f r technologietransfer angewandte forschung und enge vernetzung der innovationstreibenden geschaffen die landesmittel haben weitere investitionen in h hen von 177 97 mio eur ausgel st ein mehr als attraktiver f rderhebel
6421528 einerseits hat die tiroler zukunftsstiftung unter ber cksichtigung regionaler st rken schon beizeiten auf klare profilbildung geachtet und nur ein knappes jahr nachdem eine umfassende studie weiteren handlungsbedarf bei der betrieblichen f amp e zeigte genie en die ans ssigen unternehmen und forschungseinrichtungen ein neues f rderpaket das optimale hilfe f r spezielle bed rfnisse bietet f r den forschungs standort sterreich w nschen wir uns nachahmer in anderen bundesl ndern nur mit hnlichen initiativen in ganz sterreich k nnen wir noch rascher als bisher zu europ ischen vorzeigel ndern wie z b finnland oder schweden aufr cken
6421529 nur mit breiter hinwendung zu technologie und kooperativer innovation in m glichst vielen betrieben k nnen wir gut bezahlte arbeitspl tze sichern und in noch h herer zahl schaffen die neuen f rderprogramme werden hier einiges bewirken
6421530 wie bei den brandneuen tiroler k1 zentren oncotyrol und k1 met aus dem bundesprogramm comet bearbeiten wissenschaftliche einrichtungen und unternehmen dort mehrj hrige forschungs und entwicklungsprojekte im verbund die anforderung an die betriebliche finanzierung ist dank kleinerer gesamtvolumina aber deutlich niedriger als beim bundespendant ein wichtiger unterschied f r unsere kleinstrukturierte wirtschaft
6421531 f r die tiroler wirtschaftsstruktur fehlten bislang regional ausgewogene angebote zur innovationsf rderung diese zu schaffen war elementarer auftrag des landes an unsere einrichtung
6421532 sehr wichtig ist zus tzlich dass das neue angebot nachhaltigkeit sichert die tiroler technologief rderung ist nun eigenst ndiger schlie lich st rkt das neue angebot auch das berregionale interesse an unserem standort internationale technologiebetriebe sind in tirol ab sofort noch besser aufgehoben als zuvor

6421542 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
6421543 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy the identification of a stem cell line with onegative blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
6421544 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
6421545 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
6421546 the problem with relying on donated blood is that there are always shortages the ability to generate red blood cells in very large numbers would be a very big thing

6421572 landesrat peter kaiser und vp klubobmann stephen tauschitz erfinden eine angebliche befangenheit von kabeg aufsichtsratsvorsitzenden strutz um durch bewussten rechtsbruch zu einer aufsichtsratsmehrheit f r die sp und vp zu kommen offenbar erkennen kaiser und tauschitz dass sie die von rechtsexperten mehrfach als rechtlich unhaltbare vorgangsweise auf rechtlich ordnungsgem em wege nicht durchsetzen k nnen
6421573 nicht nur dass rot und schwarz und nicht strutz in einer unheiligen allianz die letzte aufsichtsratssitzung mit ihrer erfindung einer angeblichen befangenheit von strutz platzen lie en schuldet kaiser auch noch die dringend notwendigen und vielfach angeforderten ergebnisse der k rntenweiten angebots leistungs und strukturplanung diese ergebnisse stellen aber zentrale grundlagen unter anderem f r die feinabstimmung der betriebsorganisation f r das lkh klagenfurt neu dar
6421574 wenn kaiser ernsthaft an geordneten abl ufen und einem sichergestellten gesundheitsversorgungsauftrag interessiert ist muss er als gesundheitsreferent ganz anders handeln was er aber anscheinend aus mangelnder fachlicher qualifikation und unzureichender erfahrung nicht erkennen kann oder will

6421613 adopted by resolution 260 iii a of the united nations general assembly on 9 december 1948
6421614 the fact that mr saakashvili signed a modified version of the agreement and that attempts to get a un security council resolution signed have been torpedoed all of this indicates that it is not nato countries telling mr saakashvili what he should do to meet high nato standards its mr saakashvili telling developed democracies such as nato countries what they should do to satisfy his ambitions
6421615 and what i am saying now im going to say for the first time georgia is a civilised country but in its history there were times when it had to sell its children on the istanbul markets they were then taken to egypt and it was not only boys but girls too their mothers tried to convince them how sweet their lives would be there when the russians came they banned this slavery and i cant but say this that the russians actually saved georgia why is it that today america is the only country who has influence on georgian politics do they really need to put us at war with ossetia its logically not right it was our leaders decision to do all this aggression it was exclusively the decision of the georgian state and i believe we made a mistake a very serious mistake
6421616 the ruling peoples democratic party pdp yesterday raised alarm over secret plots by some group of persons in collaboration with some foreign entities to sabotage the nation and reverse the progress we have so far made as a democratic nation
6421617 the party said it had some documentary evidence which suggested that some foreign entities who are hell bent on creating instability in nigeria in order to play down the growing influence of nigeria in regional and international affairs are working in concert with the nigeria united for democracy nud
6421618 apparently giving credence to the secret plots president umaru musa yaradua yesterday approved the appointment of air marshall paul dike as chief of defence staff dike is to take over from general andrew azazi who is retiring from service
6421619 the pdp while frowning at the development urged security agencies to weigh in on the calls for the overthrow of established constitutional order
6421620 it would be recalled that nud is an amalgam of some opposition political parties which include action congress ac all nigeria peoples party anpp and the conference of nigerian political parties cnpp
6421621 the call for an interim government has no place in the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria
6421622 contrary to the posturing of this group nigerians have come to accept democracy as the only means for socio economic development the protection of human rights and the advancement of good governance and leadership rooted in accountability fairness and justice
6421623 the attempt to supplant a popular election with an unelected regime in 1993 led to a crisis that shook the very foundation of our country
6421624 once again the judiciary which we all look up to as the last hope of the common man has come under a vicious attack
6421625 it is also frightening that in this era of due process and the rule of law the nud in their statement advocated for a determination of conflicts politically rather than legally
6421626 the pdp believes in the structures of the nigerian nation as presently constituted
6421627 the motive and intentions of this group are very clear to create confusion and cause general disaffection within the polity because of their failure at the polls
6421628 from all available facts before us some of the conveners of the nud are working in concert with some foreign entities
6421629 in line with all the above the pdp condemns this reckless act and calls on nigerians including the security agencies to be vigilant and nip in the bud any attempt to foist any illegality on the federal republic of nigeria

6421649 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now
6421650 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country
6421651 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6421652 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6421653 im very disappointed its a shame because weve got a really good team im sorry
6421654 craig should not take full responsibility its a team event we trained really hard for this and anything can happen
6421655 the stick was in my hand but when i went to grab it he had already let go it takes a second to feel it
6421656 it is probably my fault i am going to take the blame for it i have never dropped a stick in my life it is just the way it has been happening for me this year
6421657 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy so people are very shocked and upset
6421658 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved 9 gcses
6421659 ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6421660 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6421661 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6421662 within the context of the school there is almost no issue to do with gangs because we try and create the hackney free community
6421663 clearly there are a lot of issues going on locally and nationally but they hardly impact on the school at all
6421664 but suddenly we have had this dreadful tragedy possibly as a result of gang activity
6421665 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives
6421666 apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6421667 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6421668 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6421669 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6421670 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6421671 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6421672 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the victim fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police
6421673 unfortunately from 9 05pm through 12 25am when we left 30 minutes ago there were no signs of any top chef activity famous celebrities or production crews present we are thinking that they may have set up a decoy

6421678 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6421679 there is one stumbling issue which we have been grappling with the framework of the power and roles of the president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of the transition leading up to 2 1 2 years
6421680 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally any steps that we take have to be by consensus
6421681 its to put wal mart and county officials on notice that were going to oppose this
6421682 this is just going to be a magnet for sprawl
6421683 would pave the way for desecration of the wilderness with unnecessary commercial growth such a large scale development is inappropriate next to a national park

6421753 the news from boston scientific and howley civil engineering is disappointing but while the manufacturing sector is facing notable challenges other parts of engineering remain strong
6421754 there is growth within the pharmaceutical and medical devices areas with process and project engineers still in demand and the market for them remaining very buoyant
6421755 there is also good growth in environmental engineering commercial contracting and major infrastructural projects many of these areas such as chemicals pharmaceuticals and medical equipment are also less affected by the economic cycle
6421756 so there are clear opportunities for engineers working in manufacturing and construction to use the skills that theyve acquired through initiatives such as continuing professional development cpd to now transfer into these emerging sectors

6421801 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
6421802 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
6421803 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
6421804 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
6421805 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
6421806 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
6421807 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
6421808 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
6421809 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
6421810 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6421811 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
6421812 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
6421813 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
6421814 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
6421815 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
6421816 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
6421817 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
6421818 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
6421819 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
6421820 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works

6422155 what happened to my brother was six years ago and the lta has changed its system since then
6422156 i dont have a problem with what the lta is doing now
6422157 raw tennis will probably double the amount of kids playing the game because its a lot more fun than normal
6422158 practising new tricks is cool its not about being the best in your club its about fun as well it should keep teenagers playing
6422159 growing up when i saw wimbledon it was always the old boy set up it didnt look that much fun for the younger kids
6422160 but anyone can play raw tennis anywhere in the street in a back yard or on a football pitch im really happy to promote this program the lta have organised it very well
6422161 ive learnt the tricks just messing around between points in matches and at training
6422162 i like the freestyle side to it just trying new things spectators are impressed and the showboating side of things gives you a buzz too
6422163 my club prefers it if we wear tennis clothes but i think now this has started well be able to wear more normal clothes
6422164 i think its a really good idea not only is it free but you can wear anything turn up whenever you like and you dont have to be a top player either
6422165 i think its a fantastic idea especially for juniors who arent going to be brilliant
6422166 it really gives them something to work towards with the targets and the skills it makes tennis a little bit more cool for 10 18 year olds
6422167 murrays going to be good for the game hes got that style about him cool laid back but still fun
6422168 martin is the captain here i didnt say it officially to him but he is the captain of the side at the moment and i wouldnt see that changing
6422169 laursen is laursen he leads by example im not saying he is running around shouting all over the place but neither did gareth barry
6422170 its great for the club that the two lads have signed
6422171 when you look at the impact shane has had over the last 4 years i think it was money well spent hes still quite young and i think theres still a lot more to come from him
6422172 ollies been magnificent aswell last year he struggled with one or two niggling injuries but since he came back this year hes been brilliant
6422173 this was a completely new problem and had no relationship to his knee injury

6422186 i suspect that in many ways the city is encouraging unadulterated demolition developers can bring financially shaky proposals to the table knowing full well that if their financing falls through theyll be allowed to park cars on the vacant lot the procaccianti group has even gone so far as to cry financial hardship about the minimum landscape requirements for a surface lot the city needs to start defending itself against these sorts of predatory developers
6422187 ironically last week i asked my staff to see what was happening there
6422188 the word i got back is that they want to make an appointment with me next week to talk about it that could mean anything it could mean its delayed a year or so and they want to do temporary parking it could mean its delayed six months it could mean anything
6422189 every time something like this happens it makes you sit down and review your regulations and this is one of the things well have to sit down and think about

6422193 there are still hundreds of millions of ipods out there the low hanging fruit that have not tuned in largely because people still dont know how we in podcasting and new media are too quick to give up on anyone whos not an instant early adopter and as such are leaving people and money behind in our mad attention deficit rush for instant gratification instant results instant fame chris brogan joe cronin and just about everyone else wondering what the future of podcasting is stay tuned there is far more yet to come if you are willing to have the vision commitment and dedication to achieve long term success if youre not willing to make that commitment thats okay but dont expect the same results as the folks who are

6422313 in recent days the right wing blogosphere and rumor mongers have falsely accused of misrepresenting his position on born alive legislation
6422314 the state and federal born alive infant protection acts did not include exactly the same language
6422315 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
6422316 it is rather astonishing that in light of the new documents that came to light this week the obama campaign here continues to brazenly misrepresent the content of the state the national association of pro life nurses is a not for profit organization uniting nurses who seek excellence in nurturing and caring for all including the unborn newborn mentally and or physically handicapped the aged and the dying

6422330 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market among them baby bottle nipples infant teething rings paints waxes kitchenware and appliances are safe this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market

6422332 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology which is now associated with more than 800 manufacturer identified consumer products ranging from infant pacifiers to paints to appliances to clothing

6422472 he had surgery on monday afternoon the aim is for repair as soon as possible after the injury
6422473 his rehab will initially involve letting the tendon repair and then a gradual strength programme with an anticipated return date in six months
6422474 everything went very well at the time of surgery and valeri is fit and well post op he will be back in carrington next week to start his rehab programme
6422475 we were going to talk about it but as i understand it it is a fifa designated game so he still has to be around brazil squad
6422476 martin is the captain here i didnt say it officially to him but he is the captain of the side at the moment and i wouldnt see that changing
6422477 laursen is laursen he leads by example im not saying he is running around shouting all over the place but neither did gareth barry
6422478 its great for the club that the two lads have signed
6422479 when you look at the impact shane has had over the last 4 years i think it was money well spent hes still quite young and i think theres still a lot more to come from him
6422480 ollies been magnificent aswell last year he struggled with one or two niggling injuries but since he came back this year hes been brilliant
6422481 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king
6422482 not only was he an organizer he was a humanitarian an entrepreneur he was an author he took care of the poor he spoke for the disenfranchised he was the person who was recognized and well respected in both communities african american and the white communities
6422483 the waltons are concerned they dont want to infuse money into this project and then were not able to maintain it and thats a legitimate concern

6422488 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
6422489 this is part of a family that had farmed land here for years
6422490 all of a sudden were instructing someone they have to sell that land and that seems a bit ridiculous to me at this point
6422491 i know they have to have laws in regard to restrictions and i respect that but just in this case this farm is no threat to anyone
6422492 i wanted to keep the family farm for sentimental value my grandfather was an original homesteader in 1909 so the farm has been in the family for 99 years
6422493 he fought in a war was injured twice and he comes home and dies from a mosquito bite
6422494 i was in the middle of the hall in the fetal position
6422495 honestly watching him on the mower that day was one of the scariest and happiest moments of my life all intertwined
6422496 the media in the u s reflects the interests of the u s government of the u s imperialists
6422497 gloria featured on russia today television regarding russia georgia war
6422498 say no to war has been justin raimondos slogan for over a decade from the u s intervention in bosnia to the war in iraq and afghanistan now he has denounced u s support for georgia
6422499 nearly 90 million pay tv viewers in europe north america and south africa regularly watch russia today
6422500 as well as on cable networks in practically every country of europe
6422501 the station is part of the state owned news conglomerate ria novosti and news organizations routinely refer to it as state run including the new york times which has said it was created to promote pro kremlin views
6422502 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict i think it is very important for the united states to work with the un security council and others in the international community to make sure that we are beginning to bring this conflict to a close
6422503 some major newspapers are beginning to tone down their initial anti russian stance
6422504 surprised by the media bias over events in south ossetia
6422505 a deliberate misinformation campaign was carried out by the united states
6422506 it is possible that in late october it will scare americans into voting for mccain and abandoning obama
6422507 people often ask if i was a prisoner of war with john mccain my answer is always no mccain was a pow with me the reason is i was there for eight years and john got there two and a half years later so he was a pow for five and a half years and we have our own seniority system based on time as a pow
6422508 there are a number of reasons why i will not vote for him for president of the united states
6422509 having been a pow is no special qualification for being president of the united states the two jobs are not the same and pow experiences is not in my opinion something i would look for in a presidential candidate
6422510 after our repatriation a census showed that 95 of us had been tortured at least once the vietnamese were quite democratic about it there were many heroes in north vietnam i saw heroism every day there and we motivated each other to endure far beyond what any of us thought we had in ourselves
6422511 succeeding as a pow is a group sport not an individual one we all supported and encouraged each other to succeed john knows that he was not an individual pow hero
6422512 represents the traditional conservatism that they feel has been forgotten under president bush
6422513 democrat thy name is narcissist i explain how obama was recruited into the ranks of chicago socialists i also explain his plans for america if he is elected president
6422514 they too enjoyed taking a leisure stroll across the political aisle and voting with democrats when they were on capitol hill
6422515 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6422516 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6422517 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6422518 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6422519 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6422520 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6422521 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6422522 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6422523 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6422524 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done
6422525 a productive society that can govern and provide services to its people as well as develop a gross national product
6422526 that does not come overnight thats an institutional change that will take some time
6422527 supporting education and literacy has long been a primary social cause for verizon

6422535 coming in fifth at the 88 games i felt like a loser i was walking around in a state of numbness
6422536 i was ashamed to come home to indianapolis they were going to have a parade for me things were lined up for me in hollywood the pressure was extremely high and then oh there goes the rest of my life

6422538 technically she was very solid she just had a little lack of mental toughness
6422539 i knew she could win she just had to set her mind to it
6422540 my coach was really proud of me for listening to him for not going with my instincts
6422541 i cant blame anybody i was just being a perfect student by listening to my coach
6422542 i met so many of the wrong people the wrong influences
6422543 i believe in the grace of god and strong will just believing and pushing on
6422544 at this point in my life ive been through it all but my arms are always open because the lord will be forgiving me so im always forgiving toward everyone now
6422545 martial arts took a big cut of my time the coaches didnt really like us dating because they thought it was distracting
6422546 they wanted us to keep our mental game in focus
6422547 thats kind of sad isnt it i was married to my sport for 11 years
6422548 but a lot of my friends remind me that i made the u s olympic team and a lot of people cant say that
6422549 it is clear to us and the u s leadership does not deny this that the u s anti missile defense in europe will be broadened and modernized in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6422550 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
6422551 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
6422552 i would not have nominated uhhh clarence thomas uh i dont think that uhhh i i i i i i dont think that he was an exper uh a strong enough jurist or legal thinker uh at the time uh for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6422553 id like to tell you a time on it but i cant i dont know what that time is on it

6422559 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
6422560 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
6422561 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them

6422563 the company again recorded operating income positive cash flow from operations and net income
6422564 we continue to believe that both the u s and worldwide epilepsy markets represent significant opportunities for the company to realize consistent growth in both sales and earnings in the coming years
6422565 specifically we believe that continued corporate focus on epilepsy improved pricing geographic expansion and an evolving replacement cycle can together enable us to increase revenues in the medium term
6422566 indicative of our worldwide focus we recently received regulatory approval in china and appointed a distributor for that market
6422567 our recent announcement that jeffrey schwarz would be stepping down from our board and that joe laptewicz has accepted a nomination to join the board is further evidence of the continuing transition of the company
6422568 we thank jeffrey for his important contributions to the companys turnaround and look forward to leveraging joes significant medical device and neuromodulation expertise as we continue to grow our business
6422569 we are maintaining our longer term goals for our epilepsy business which include consistent annual volume growth in the range of 10 to 20 and the achievement of an operating margin of 25 by fiscal 2011 further our improved balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to achieve sustained increases in shareholder value the management and staff of cyberonics remain focused on executing our strategic plan around epilepsy

6422571 which two perky olympian teammates are really bitter rivals one spiked the others protein shake with laxatives before a big competition but her plan backfired when her nemesis not only powered through the competition but beat her so called friend anyway
6422572 as of now there are no plans for me to be on the show i hope it turns out to be a really great show just for my dads legacy
6422573 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff shes one of my best friends in the whole world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews we were staring at a post it with a smiley face so i think i probably rolled my eyes a hundred times
6422574 fuck off dont touch my bird lets take this outside you think youre a big man
6422575 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad
6422576 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
6422577 i love horses ive learned from them once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself riding horses has a rhythm thats rather zen like when you can mount it and move it and move along with it that is a hard won and very real accomplishment
6422578 i wont say im never going to do drugs again i just know im not a good person on drugs
6422579 the majority of times i go to the cinema i want a bit of everything i want to be challenged intellectually and then again i dont want to be too challenged intellectually i believe my wife to be very creative so of course im interested in how she thinks and there seems to be no end to the desire to be creative i find that invigorating and interesting you know you have conversations some deep some shallow thats the same in everybodys relationship
6422580 i dont think running for office is anything im prepared for or could even prepare myself for i work really long hours and work a lot and have done press tours and junkets but there is nothing like a presidential campaign that i have experienced before i think at one point we visited three different cities in one state in 12 hours its exhausting

6422650 i think i speak for millions of people in the uk when i say we have been dazzled we have impressed we have been blown away by these beijing games but we have not been intimidated
6422651 and in our own sweet way without wasting taxpayers money i am absolutely convinced that we can do just as well in 2012
6422652 the games are changing the public perception of the olympics olympo sceptics are being rapidly converted
6422653 i think millions of people in britain and in london are deeply concerned obviously about human rights in china
6422654 but i feel very strongly that these games offer a fantastic opportunity for china to open up to the rest of the world and for china to understand how the rest of the world thinks about china
6422655 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man

6422675 ive loved television since i was old enough to reach the dial
6422676 television is meaningful to me its frustrating and fascinating all at the same time
6422677 as far as conviction of casting me all the credit goes to him ram gopal verma i had no idea what he had in his mind due to lot of intensity in the character he casted me and probably wanted me to make the character look real and not very star cast type he has gone on with casting because i guess because he wanted people to just get into the flow of the subject and not the casting
6422678 my character in the film is about a girl who is a complete believer in god somewhere down the line she starts believing in black magic she thinks that as god is power so is black magic which takes one towards the evil but slowly as the film progresses she thinks that practical things like doctors and medicine also exist so my character transforms from a complete believer in god towards an atheist
6422679 actually i was excited and i wanted to do this movie because i had to touch the roof and somebody who was to slap me was not visible
6422680 it is a meager price to pay for good fortune

6422688 its not enjoyable but its a great experience to be at the olympics and im fortunate to be one of those few people who have been to the olympics i just wish i had done better for our country and the rest of the team
6422689 we did it so right this time we proved ourselves by being here and the boat turned out perfect sometimes this is life

6422695 i went into a room and performed all my stuff such as somersaults back flips rolls all the things lara can do in the game i got a recall and performed all my stuff again this time in costume and i got the job
6422696 i would love to meet them but especially angelina shes brilliant and has always been a role model of mine i love her acting she is so very talented and beautiful before i even auditioned i watched the films over and over and played the video game to make sure i understood the character perfectly
6422697 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad
6422698 mr president are you aware unless youre rich you have poor health care it makes you scream and want to pull out your hair discharged from the hospital soon as you get there
6422699 tell me how to set that up and i would be there in a heartbeat
6422700 i think we should all take a page from phelps book eat the rice and then do something with the fuel youve just put into your body
6422701 the majority of the follow up is already in the can though they will have to go back into the studio at some point to add a few more songs
6422702 the world record that i thought would be the record at 200 meters until the day i died is gone
6422703 bolt doesnt have a natural ability to run the curve as well as i think is required to clock 19 32 at this point and i doubt if the emphasis in his training has been on speed endurance since it was clear on saturday that his focus has been on improving his 100m technique so for now at least the record is safe but only for now
6422704 it falls short of being four 1 records in a row i think with the jonas brothers second week
6422705 half of that is more than what well sell and its good for those guys all i can say is weve been here for 10 years and this is our sixth record i feel proud to be able to say that if its not 1 its not 1 what are you going to do
6422706 but its just a different version of the boy band thing all over again
6422707 we went in and started writing and the songs that were coming out werent the heaviest songs but they were really good songs
6422708 we wrote 14 songs and there are 13 on the album there was only one song that didnt make it and it wasnt because it didnt stand up i just couldnt come up with anything to sing over it musically it was one of my favorite songs on the record i just couldnt come up with anything that was worthy of it in a melody and lyrical sense the songs we were writing were great songs we couldnt cast them aside and say no those arent heavy enough if we had wed probably still be there writing
6422709 i hope theyre happy surprised and that they can just realize that we wrote the best songs we could
6422710 we work very hard to grow as a band and i think we made a pretty good step this time
6422711 the only thing i know that really changed for me was when i should have been upstairs in my room working on songs i was playing with the kids

6422765 the world and most zimbabweans pray for a free and fair election not marred by violence and intimidation as in the past
6422766 we urge the sadc observers to produce a report characterised by integrity and honestly we have let down the suffering people of zimbabwe for too long already they deserve better
6422767 since the runoff was announced the violence in zimbabwe has gotten even worse zimbabweans cant vote freely if they fear their vote may get them killed
6422768 the government knows this is nonsense we work around the world and stay out of politics
6422769 we are desperate to get working but until the world food programme signs an agreement with the government we cant
6422770 even some top zanu pf politicians are encouraging us to break the ban as there is pressure from traditional leaders for food aid
6422771 if the ban is lifted it will take us another month to set up food in warehouses in south africa may be sent to other countries or else it will become stale
6422772 honestly i dont know and we know the situation is bad
6422773 what is really happening i cant even buy a meal for my grandchildren every time i look at them my heart bleeds and i cry

6422776 we hope britain and america will send us food tomorrow
6422777 an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6422778 firmly committed to this dialogue for one reason and one reason alone the suffering of zimbabweans has to come to an end and any opportunity of liberating them from the current madness has to be pursued to its logical conclusion

6422789 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6422790 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it mindarus ebayi
6422791 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days

6423061 white man dumb enough to think he could improve a system like that
6423062 one of ron pauls great gifts is his ability to make complicated issues understandable and indeed memorable to average people for example he notes that us meddling in the caucasus is like the russians arming and training the mexican army to take back new mexico

6423065 the future of music manifesto for the digital music revolution
6423066 the financials of the music business have changed to the point that we have to find ways to make money in other places
6423067 i didnt think six years ago when we started trying to sell music that wed be selling vitaminwater and shoes and clothes now were moving into other directions and four or five years from now its exciting to think about us looking at natural resources and raw materials and other businesses
6423068 i intend to warn the cabinet ministers on the danger inherent in approving the budget

6423076 not only is this not the slam dunk that is being projected you probably have a better chance of hitting a blindfolded shot from mid court than coskata has of producing cost competitive ethanol
6423077 yes gasification plants are expensive to put on the ground
6423078 but the production cost is half that of gasoline and you also have more feedstock flexibility you can gasify trash tires agricultural residues wood waste any kind of biomass
6423079 the capital costs would have to go down by a factor of 100 before they could even start to get competitive
6423080 it is very expensive to do commercial demonstrations any facility producing under 1 to 2 million gallons per year is going to be unbelievably inefficient
6423081 you can never do your economics off of a demonstration

6423157 obviamente me tranquiliza la libertad que nunca deb perder la fiscal a valor de manera diferente las pruebas que obran en el expediente y revoc la medida de aseguramiento desde luego eso me tiene muy contento
6423158 es natural porque lo que se revoc fue la medida de aseguramiento el superior que tom la decisi n no pod a hacer otra cosa que confirmarla o revocarla no pod a decidir como lo dice la ley sobre la preclusi n de la investigaci n hay que esperar un poco para que llegue ese momento pero espero que llegue pronto
6423159 fue una experiencia dura que hab a que soportarla pero ofrece la posibilidad de reflexionar de ponerse en paz con dios con uno mismo
6423160 absolutamente de nada esto ofrece momentos duros pero tambi n la posibilidad de mirar hacia adentro de revisar lo que se ha hecho y proyectarse hacia el futuro pero creo que ella la reclusi n ofrece una buena oportunidad para encontrarse con dios y agradecerle por la existencia sirve para unirse a la familia la pol tica es una actividad que aleja a los hombres de los seres queridos de los buenos amigos la pol tica es una actividad que lo hace perder a uno el sentido de muchas cosas importantes
6423161 no quiero hablar de eso pero hago una reflexi n la pol tica se ha convertido en una actividad peligrosa uno se acuesta como senador de la rep blica como presidente de un partido como ex presidente del congreso y como una persona importante y reconocida en el pa s pero de la noche a la ma ana por cuenta de un testimonio de un bandido jairo antonio castillo peralta alias pitirri que busca beneficios para s mismo su familia para mantener un estatus de asilado y una serie infinita de privilegios como la protecci n de la real polic a montada de canad adem s de la impunidad para cientos de delitos que se han cometido uno amanece convertido en un bandido eso es absurdo y no se lo deseo a nadie
6423162 yo no quiero hacer ese juicio me fui a la fiscal a porque sent que all encontrar a m s garant as y a pesar de la medida de aseguramiento que nunca debi proferirse encontr una instancia y una valoraci n diferente de las pruebas que me enviaron a la c rcel estoy satisfecho porque creo que en la fiscal a se logra una segunda instancia y el proceso avanza por manos diferentes la virtud de esto es que quienes hacen la investigaci n no son los que lo juzgan a uno algo muy importante para la defensa de los derechos del procesado

6423169 ojal lo supiera sospecho sobre qui n puede ser el autor de eso pero como no quiero incurrir en las cosas que critico no me atrevo a se alar la verdad va fluyendo no tengo duda de que alguien influy en pitirri para que me acusara con mentiras que le han sido muy tiles a l y a los opositores del presidente se descubrir la verdad y alg n d a sabremos qui n fue el que influy en pitirri para que me acusara la fiscal a hizo un examen minucioso y concluy lo que ten a que concluir que pitirri es un farsante y un mentiroso

6423228 marriage is not simply a civil institution nor is it simply a religious institution it is instead a natural institution whose definition as the union of one man and one woman is rooted in the order of nature itself there is only one reason why marriage is treated as a public institution to promote and regulate the type of relationship that can result naturally in the reproduction of the human race marriage encourages the raising of children by the mother and father who conceived them social science confirms that children who are raised by their own married mother and father are happier healthier and more prosperous than those raised in any other family structure
6423229 in addition to deliberately creating and affirming motherless or fatherless families other harms would result from same sex

6423256 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6423257 i dreamt about rain last night it could have been 500 degrees or 500 below and wed be happy
6423258 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6423259 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do
6423260 i wouldnt wish it on anybody but its the careers we have and we have to make the best of it
6423261 id like to see my husband for more than a day it would be nice to walk in the door and say honey whats for dinner instead of having to make food for myself
6423262 i want to start a family and like kerri said were not in a rush to get back
6423263 everybody keeps bringing up 2012 but let us enjoy this one first
6423264 im not done and i hope misty isnt done yet either
6423265 you can say they are the best ever at beach volleyball
6423266 its now or never if it keeps spreading its going to become such a problem that were never going to be able to get a handle on it
6423267 if someone is spraying to control soybean rust and they have kudzu close at hand it could allow that rust to come back to their field

6423270 the french revolution produced the saying no enemies to the left a mindset that has poisoned both the left and the right in american politics as a result some figures who should be repudiated have instead become prominent representatives on the right in particular the go along to get along approach has created a movement where the bad guys are protected and the people who get promoted are those who make friends not waves
6423271 the continued tolerance and prominence of jerome corsi his books columns and appearances
6423272 is embarrassing for the right embarrassing for republicans embarrassing for conservatives and libertarians embarrassing for all of us
6423273 t here is one enormous problem with jerome corsi hes a habitually dishonest buffoon who will say absolutely anything to make a buck hes the rights michael moore except that michael moore has much more talent and certain boundaries beyond which even he wont go
6423274 keep in mind folks this is the same lunatic who has been running around for years telling people that george bush is going to somehow personally merge the us canada and mexico over the objections of the american people and congress in other words jerome corsi is a conspiracy nut whose credibility level is zero
6423275 oh yeah lets put this embarrassing nutjob on point in the attack against barack obama what could go wrong
6423276 it isnt just that corsi himself is a conspiracy theorist and a crank or that his best selling farrago of innuendo and outright smears exemplifies everything thats wrong with a certain sort of right wing publishing or that david freddosos the case against barack obama demonstrates that its perfectly possible to write an anti obama book without descending into the fever swamps its that this is an election where conservatives need to be very very conscious about the importance of line drawing if the right is going to resist the ongoing attempts by obamaphiles to define various sorts of normal political elbow throwing cutting ads making fun of barack obamas political style calling attention to the controversial public utterances of michelle obama and jeremiah wright etc as inherently racist and hatemongering conservatives need to be very clear about where the line actually is and what sort of attacks are actually beyond the pale and worth condemning
6423277 corsis approach to politics is both destructive and self destructive
6423278 conservatism has been an intellectual home to people like burke and buckley the gop is the party that gave us lincoln and reagan it seems to me that its leaders ought to make it clear that they find what dr corsi is doing to be both wrong and repellent to have their movement and their party associated with such a figure would be a terrible thing and it will only help the cause of those who hold both the gop and the conservative movement in contempt
6423279 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp

6423295 this program is mutually beneficial to the university of guelph and to linamar

6423299 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6423300 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6423301 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6423302 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6423303 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group

6423360 das stufenlose getriebe ist am freitag in ungarn gelaufen und wird valencia im rennen eingesetzt was war der hintergrund dieser entscheidung
6423361 wir haben das getriebe zum ersten mal bei einem shakedown in silverstone getestet danach noch einmal drei tage lang in jerez aber dies ist so eine wichtige komponente dass es eigentlich nie genug zeit gibt es genau zu durchforschen der ungarn freitag gab uns die m glichkeit eines zus tzlichen tests und zudem haben wir strafen vermieden wenn wir mitten in unserem vier rennen zyklus ein getriebe gewechselt h tten
6423362 die getriebe aus ungarn befanden sich in rennen drei eines zyklus und sie zu wechseln h tte eine bestrafung nach sich gezogen so hat es sinn gemacht noch ein paar kilometer damit zu fahren und das neue getriebe dann einzusetzen wenn ein neuer vier rennen zyklus beginnt
6423363 unsere simulationen zeigen typischerweise einen gewinn von zwei bis drei zehntel pro runde vielleicht auch etwas mehr denn der fahrer kann so fr her aufs gas gehen weil das auto nicht mehr durch einen gangwechsel unruhig ist
6423364 der fahrer kann auch deshalb auch sanfter beschleunigen weshalb es weniger beeintr chtigungen in den kurven und unter volllast gibt wir werden berall einen vorteil haben denn wir k nnen das getriebe auf jeden kurs einstellen um das optimum heraus zu holen daher wird der effekt auf jeder strecke konstant sein
6423365 welche prozesse wurden beeinflusst da man das getriebe ja mitten in der saison einf hrte
6423366 mit unseren begrenzten ressourcen hat das team einen guten job gemacht f r ein kleines team ist es eine gro e sache eine solch gro e komponente zu saisonmitte einzuf hren denn wir besitzen nicht die testm glichkeiten die andere teams haben
6423367 wir konnten erst am getriebe arbeiten als wir force india wurden und damit vern nftige budgets und ausreichend ressourcen zur verf gung standen aus ingenieurssicht hat das team einen tollen job gemacht das ganze sogar im zeitplan zu schaffen und die getriebeabteilung hat auch gute arbeit erledigt denn die einf hrung des stufenlosen getriebes verlief bisher samtweich
6423368 nat rlich gibt es aufgrund der begrenzten testkilometer ein paar risiken aber dieser schritt ist f r das team ein notwendiger schritt in sachen zukunft das erste modell lief auf anhieb ber drei wochenenddistanzen bevor ein kleines problem auftrat die zuverl ssigkeit ist also sehr gut und wir werden in der lage sein dieses kleine problem zu l sen
6423369 nat rlich kann man nicht alle informationen aus dem computer ziehen
6423370 warum hat man das getriebe nicht schon fr her eingef hrt
6423371 einzig wegen der finanzen und der ressourcen beides machte das risiko einer einf hrung zu gro erst seit dem wir force india sind hatten wir alle zutaten zur umsetzung zusammen das aktuelle projekt wurde aber gut umgesetzt und schon alleine dieser umstand zeigt die gewachsene st rke im team
6423372 wir bereitet sich das team f r eine neue strecke vor
6423373 neue strecken sind immer besondere herausforderungen f r ein team aber es ist f r die fahrer und ingenieure auch eine interessante herausforderung valencia wird ein faszinierendes und einzigartiges event werden nat rlich schauen wir uns das streckenlayout genau an und bereiten alles in unseren simulationsprogrammen vor
6423374 so bekommen wir eine ziemlich genaue vorstellung vom charakter des kurses nat rlich kann man nicht alle informationen aus dem computer ziehen speziell die asphaltbeschaffenheit wie die reifen darauf reagieren oder ob man die kerbs benutzen kann oder nicht das sind alles unbekannte bis wir vor ort sind aber es ist eine sch ne herausforderung und h lt uns auf trab

6423388 there was a bomb in the garden and all the apples on the trees fell down
6423389 the wall fell down all the windows were destroyed and now there is nothing left because of the fire
6423390 they came and asked us for wine but first we had to drink it ourselves to show that it was not poisoned then they drank the wine themselves and then they said to leave this place as soon as possible otherwise they would kill us the russians were looking for anyone who had soldiers in their home if anyone had a georgian soldier at home they burned the houses immediately
6423391 he was trying to keep the house and the fields
6423392 afterward he wanted to leave but he was circled by soldiers it was impossible he was in the orchards hiding from the russians in case they lit the house he was walking and met the russian soldiers and he made up his mind that he couldnt stay any more the russian soldiers called him and asked where he was going if he was going to the american side
6423393 my husband said he was going to see his family
6423394 and the russians said again are you going to the american side
6423395 so the russians view you as the american side even though there are no americans here

6423400 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy so people are very shocked and upset
6423401 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved 9 gcses
6423402 ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6423403 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6423404 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6423405 within the context of the school there is almost no issue to do with gangs because we try and create the hackney free community
6423406 clearly there are a lot of issues going on locally and nationally but they hardly impact on the school at all
6423407 but suddenly we have had this dreadful tragedy possibly as a result of gang activity
6423408 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives
6423409 apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6423410 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6423411 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6423412 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6423413 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6423414 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6423415 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the victim fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police

6423423 ive never heard of an adult of such magnitude in agreement with me on this
6423424 causing people to go behind closed doors and underground in their drinking
6423425 thats where the problems start people think they are cool because they are breaking the law and they do stupid things

6423428 probably will not decrease the level of consumption right away but it would take away some of the illegal aspects of it
6423429 when the food is no longer forbidden it might not be as desirable
6423430 i really think thats a facile way of looking at it
6423431 students in grades 6 12 ranked the drinking age as the number one reason why they choose not to use alcohol
6423432 i see a lot of underage people drinking when theyre not supposed to and they try to drive
6423433 at one point lucas was asking me if id ever want to direct anything

6423438 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6423439 we have no records of these two names in our system
6423440 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6423441 and he didnt tell anybody he didnt know until sunday
6423442 we also have to work the the dark side if you will weve got to spend time in the shadows of the intelligence world
6423443 a lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly without any discussion using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies if were going to be successful
6423444 all you need to know is that there was a before 9 11 and there was an after 9 11 after 9 11 the gloves come off
6423445 guantanamo bay detainee al qahtani was interrogated for and im illustrating now not the exact something like 48 out of 52 days often for stretches exceeding 12 to 14 or even 16 hours a day
6423446 he was kept in cold rooms such that he was shivering uncontrollably his heart rate would drop he was provided fluids intravenously without the opportunity to go to the bathroom he was sexually humiliated by female us guards and other treatments of this sort
6423447 i stand for 8 10 hours a day why is standing limited to four hours

6423457 law enforcement agencies would be allowed to target groups as well as individuals and to launch a criminal intelligence investigation based on the suspicion that a target is engaged in terrorism or providing material support to terrorists
6423458 they also could share results with a constellation of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies and others in many cases

6423700 it seems to be more a case of sentiment than actual changes in the underlying commodities

6423704 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6423705 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6423706 the world is experiencing an energy shock of a kind not seen since the early 1970s but which is likely to have more profound and lasting consequences
6423707 global demand for all types of energy has risen steeply and supplies of finite resources like oil and gas are under intense pressure
6423708 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6423709 consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6423710 i would also urge people to contact their suppliers to find out what help they can get towards making their home more energy efficient we are all paying an extra 39 a year on our bills towards suppliers energy efficiency schemes so why not try to get something back
6423711 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed
6423712 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6423713 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6423714 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6423715 the other group involved is described as black male youths

6423735 sixty million indigenous peoples are dependent on forests for their livelihoods food and medicines
6423736 these people have already been severely impacted by deforestation if the value of their forests increases governments and corporations may be willing to go to extreme lengths to wrest forests away from indigenous peoples and others
6423737 delegates are focusing on finance but to stop deforestation land rights must be centre stage these un climate talks shamefully continue to take place without any meaningful participation by indigenous peoples
6423738 the us could say that it will only join a post kyoto agreement on condition that they it can offset emissions by buying deforestation credits it would be a catastrophe
6423739 it could crash the price of carbon and would mean the reduction of pollution in rich countries would be come quite uneconomic
6423740 these concerns are legitimate and need to be heard and respected we strongly support we have to learn from the past
6423741 without quick and robust investment in securing forest community rights these carbon markets will further marginalise the poorest of the poor
6423742 even the world bank is saying that this is the social justice issue of our generation

6423745 our tiny 303ul represents a breakthrough in enabling space and power constrained pcie applications
6423746 beta testing is completed pci sig certification received and tier 1 volume platform designs are in progress the 303ul is very well positioned to address the large tam for volume platforms in all three major market segments computing consumer and networking
6423747 our tier 1 customer designs represent a rapid transition to dp enabled notebooks and displays and our pi3vdp612 dp switch expedites their product introduction by providing next generation routing with power and space reduction features they can use today
6423748 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking with an object
6423749 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
6423750 striking a child with an object is unacceptable and may be dangerous
6423751 as such low levels of ionising radiation is one of the smallest risks in the environment and causes a tiny amount of the spontaneous damage to dna in our bodies
6423752 it has led to unacceptable societal penalties as clearly demonstrated in the aftermath of the chernobyl catastrophe
6423753 the time has come to change the lnt paradigm and to base radiological safety and protection on modern knowledge and the realities of the natural radiation environment
6423754 if we allow things to continue unchanged and we dont take action today it would destabilize human society
6423755 developing countries will do what they can but it was clearly understood and laid down in the framework convention on climate change in 1992 that the developed countries will take the first steps frankly theyve done nothing at all and thats really tragic
6423756 we came up with the kyoto protocol in 1997 but it got ratified only in 2005 it took so long to give substance to something which had been agreed on in 1992
6423757 this elusive species is a good indicator of forest health large cats need prey and the prey deer macaques and bearded pigs need the forest
6423758 the clouded leopard is the largest predator on borneo there are no tigers having the islands top predator surviving in an ex logging concession hopefully means that the species is resilient
6423759 with more time and increased number of photos we can start to identify individual cats look at which cameras they show up on to get an idea of range and possible range overlap with the smaller cats

6423766 that was roughly as long as the one they use to launch the space shuttle
6423767 it depends on the time of year whether its flu season time for seasonal allergies or with our younger population time for physicals
6423768 we cant treat sprains strains or fractures because we have no x ray machines
6423769 the other things that people ask for all the time and that we dont do are pain medications especially for migraines
6423770 for those who dont know what our service includes an electronic message board spools the information and some people just want direction on what the next step in taking care of themselves would be

6423773 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6423774 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6423775 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6423776 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6423777 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6423778 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid
6423779 this case has been a rollercoaster ride since the beginning the california pharmacists association applauds judge snyder for recognizing the damage that the cuts were having on pharmacy and the patients they serve
6423780 we are grateful for this much needed and timely victory the judge has saved the day for patients and for the pharmacy network in california
6423781 since the safety and effectiveness of rhbmp for treatment of cervical spine conditions has not been demonstrated and in light of the serious adverse events described above fda recommends that practitioners either use approved alternative treatments or consider enrolling as investigators in approved clinical studies
6423782 in view of the fda notification concerning life threatening complications of rhbmp in cervical fusion we are encouraged that the profile of our allogeneic cells in the cervical interbody space may translate into a safe and effective clinical alternative
6423783 in addition the very low dose of allogeneic cells that were effective in the interbody procedure to obtain cervical fusion makes this target market a very attractive and high margin new commercial opportunity for mesoblast
6423784 the long term improvement in physical function that we observed in patients who have undergone knee replacement surgery is striking when set against the decline that occurred in the comparison group
6423785 these benefits extended to those patients who were clinically obese our results show that as long as appropriate selection criteria are applied with regard to fitness for surgery there seems little justification for withholding the operation from patients who are obese
6423786 but i tell you in good conscience that if we had to do it again i would do it again a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6423787 the work you are doing here is vital i say that to your comrades in europe because there are soldiers from the whole of europe here
6423788 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6423789 woodlands and the open spaces within them have a vital contribution to make towards conserving scotlands threatened habitats and species
6423790 we are very fortunate in scotland to enjoy a wealth of biodiversity that is for the most part robust and healthy
6423791 however some elements are extremely fragile and making sure that they thrive will require some large scale thinking and landscape scale vision both of which are forestry sector strengths
6423792 were very confident our data supports that homes do indeed contribute to fire suppression costs
6423793 the bottom line is how much land needs to be protected
6423794 whats saving us is we still only have 1 million people
6423795 as we go fight fire to protect peoples homes and they dont burn who are we saving money for
6423796 it may be all the way from voluntary to you go do it period
6423797 that type of trend is sure to impact fire suppression costs
6423798 ruff immediately fell in love with mairs gritty momentum changing style making mair even more attractive to the coach is the fact that he was acquired in a trade with the los angeles kings for former first rounder erik rasmussen whom ruff could never cajole into playing passionate hockey

6423800 dont forget the guys waiting in rochester like 22 year olds ryan miller and norm milley

6423803 kalinin could develop into one the leagues elite stay at home defensemen
6423804 the sabres also would prefer to reduce birons heavy workload from last season when he tied the team record for games played with 72 he was ridden so hard because the sabres couldnt trust former backup bob essensa

6423812 even the world bank is saying that this is the social justice issue of our generation
6423813 its like planting a big red flag on the tumor to attract the attention of the bodys immune system which normally ignores cancerous cells
6423814 its a great idea we just dont know how to do it yet
6423815 we will ask the igg antibodies to carry the bacteria derived nucleic acid as a guest throughout the body
6423816 this will allow the nucleic acid to circulate for days which is different from how antibodies have been used in classical targeted delivery
6423817 rapidly growing solid tumors are surrounded by imperfect almost chaotic blood flow
6423818 the tissue is very leaky because of this unusual permeability the antibody nucleic acid complex should become lodged in the tumor periphery this should mimic a local infection which the body will work to eliminate
6423819 the device offers several incremental benefits that we believe will appeal to both corporate users and consumers including vastly improved speed and web browsing a camera phone which should appeal to consumers more accurate voice recognition larger keys for easier typing and an elegant design with smoother curves and leather backing
6423820 your input would have been appreciated about three weeks ago but right now the ball is in motion and there isnt a whole lot i can do to change things like that id appreciate it if you could be a little more tactful in your responses no one from the old picnic team got involved with this years event so i flew pretty much blind
6423821 well i want to make you successful and weve just been busy and i didnt know what times things were happening
6423822 if we allow things to continue unchanged and we dont take action today it would destabilize human society

6423873 this old building cannot be moved effectively and the cost of restoration will be huge for the community it should be retained where it can be architecturally enhanced

6423875 environmental degradation that has been and continues to be occurring on site or in neighbouring waters of the great barrier reef marine park and world heritage area
6423876 despite the local community undertaking monitoring of the site they remain largely in the dark as to the results of assessments of compliance with approval conditions and are left to simply trust that proper independent assessments have been undertaken and that all appropriate action will be taken to ensure that no further environmental harm is caused as a result of this controversial development

6423903 supporting the growth of new high quality charter schools is critical to our efforts to improve the educational opportunities for all children

6423905 i think the cairns ports has passed its use by date and it should all be handed back to the ratepayers and taxpayers of north queensland through our regional council rob williams says
6423906 some people have positive feelings about the general some dont like him but this will come as a shock
6423907 the violent overthrow of the sovereign government of the nation of laos with which the united states is at peace
6423908 the defendants and their conspirators practiced marksmanship with ak 47 style rifles at firing ranges operated by private parties
6423909 used paint ball weapons and equipment to practice small unit military tactics and simulate actual combat in preparation for violent jihad
6423910 a couple of the defendants had traveled to pakistan and participated in a training camp operated by lashkar i taiba so it is not disputed that the two of them came back and talked about the cause
6423911 now what is in dispute is that when they played paintball they were doing those activities as preparation to fight with a terrorist organization against a friend of the united states
6423912 a byproduct of a larger focus on international terrorism after 9 11
6423913 naturally leads to more scrutiny of potentially harmful activity that individuals may engage in outside the u s
6423914 this case fits the pattern of many recent so called
6423915 you cannot conspire to overthrow a foreign government with whom our nation is at peace

6423923 this is a rare opportunity to tell the story of whats going on in the midwest said himle who noted that the last midwest political convention was in 1976 in kansas city
6423924 this is a chance to bring influential people from around the world together himle said
6423925 its an orgy with special interests trying to buy officials he says
6423926 honoring a group of pols such as the congressional black caucus
6423927 im not saying youre going to buy somebodys vote because youve got some band playing and free food
6423928 i find it funny that all of these people are commenting on me saying im a terrible role model and yet none of them have ever been into my classroom and watched me teach and see how i interact with the kids
6423929 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6423930 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6423931 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6423932 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6423933 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6423934 we thought someone was winding us up when we first got the call but after they explained what was needed we were happy to get a group of players together to go and help out
6423935 it was a healing thing for me to do something positive out of all those downed trees
6423936 davids guitars have inspired my songwriting and fueled my performances with new energy
6423937 from a design standpoint not too bad but not too playable
6423938 it was a great experience in that i worked on a lot of instruments and learned a lot of about the business
6423939 i could see that i wasnt getting to where i wanted to go in life in the city and i wasnt even sure where i wanted to go
6423940 he turned a negative devastating moment into a joyous thing
6423941 thats how he chose to work through everything that happened in that moment and made something that lives on
6423942 it was just what i wanted in a dreadnought guitar
6423943 they are not consistent enough for commercial settings but i can pick and choose
6423944 to create awareness on current political issues and agendas for americans and the global community
6423945 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6423946 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6423947 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6423948 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6423949 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6423950 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6423951 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6423952 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6423953 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6423954 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6423955 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6423956 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6423957 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6423958 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6423959 well when she was 6 or 7 months old she saw me go and i got up to brush my teeth and she decided she needed to go
6423960 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6423961 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6423962 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6423963 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6423964 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6423965 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6423966 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6423967 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6423968 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6423969 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6423970 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6423971 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6423972 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6423973 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6423974 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6423975 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6423976 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6423977 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6423978 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6423979 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6423980 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6423981 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6423982 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6423983 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6423984 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6423985 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6423986 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6423987 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6423988 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6423989 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6423990 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6423991 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6423992 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6423993 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6423994 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6423995 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6423996 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6423997 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6423998 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6423999 you have to make a film thats universal that touches people
6424000 the chance to collaborate and bring people together and share the communal experience of having a common goal
6424001 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6424002 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6424003 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6424004 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6424005 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6424006 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6424007 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6424008 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6424009 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6424010 who are open to doing something on the production side
6424011 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6424012 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6424013 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6424014 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6424015 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6424016 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6424017 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6424018 we are trying our best to restrain our commanders in order to save the situation this can be a beginning of the war if not properly handled
6424019 there is still a chance in going back to peace as long as both parties for us and for the side of the government will implement utmost restraint in order to hold back the situation
6424020 that could happen if the government fails to restore peace and order and protect civilians
6424021 still wants the memorandum of agreement but the pressure is on her to deal forcefully with milf
6424022 the milf leadership if they are serious about achieving peace in mindanao should discipline their ranks and not allow them to wreak havoc on the people of mindanao
6424023 exposed the fact that the milf does not really respect human rights the niceties of democratic and legal processes and that they do not yet have the requisites of a responsible political movement and a credible aspirant for state governance
6424024 may have gained something out of this fiasco it was able to press the government to recognize at least in motherhood principles the ancestral domain claim of the bangsamoro people
6424025 is a step forward in the milfs jihad toward self determination
6424026 the government cannot afford not to have peace talks in mindanao

6424059 i am very happy to win a medal in boxing for india
6424060 all credit goes to my coaches and my parents especially my father who went to a far away temple to prey for my success
6424061 he was brilliant although his opponent was a very good boxer he really boxed well using his mind and body at the same time it was really fantastic
6424062 i think i did well and its an honour to at least make it to the quarterfinals
6424063 this time i got desperate and i couldnt control what i had to do now i have to focus on the 2012 olympic games
6424064 reaching the quarterfinals may seem to be an achievement but i wanted to win a medal
6424065 i will certainly do that at the 2012 olympic games there was no pressure on me at all coaches were yelling from the ringside in the third round score 13 8 ordering me to go on all cylinders but the most troublesome thing was the stitches i have in my chin i was very worried about the stitches i was thinking if i get hit and started oozing blood from the chin i may be stopped by the referee it was really a psychological thing which played its part
6424066 i was desperate because i didnt know him i didnt know his style and even though i was confident before the bout i got desperate
6424067 my father 1972 67kg olympic champion emilio correa gave me so much good advice and im trying to follow it my dream is to become an olympic champion just like him
6424068 i know him and i dont want to listen to him wheres mr regan
6424069 choosing to shoot the film in new york was a risky decision as the drama industry works very differently in the us from the uk
6424070 but the huge amount of strategic planning and the leap of faith are delivering a first rate calibre of cast there is a real buzz about the project in manhattan as quentin was a much loved and notorious figure everyone has an anecdote to tell about him
6424071 and weve been touched by the number of friends and admirers of his some of whom he never knew who have wanted to help with the project in myriad different ways
6424072 we are delighted to be making another film about quentin crisp given the naked civil servant was such a landmark film for itv
6424073 its a real thrill and honour to be bringing an actor of john hurts stature back to the channel to reprise such an iconic role
6424074 this is largely down to the quality of brian fillis wonderful script which completely captures the extraordinary and outrageous character of quentin crisp
6424075 immediately the owners came out and changed the gas prices they brought it down we had marvellous success down in st louis missouri
6424076 our study confirms that women experience significant bone loss due to cancer treatments and that zoledronic acid can prevent this loss
6424077 while our findings are promising its too early for us to recommend this drug for all premenopausal women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer because we dont yet have all the information we need on dosing cost effectiveness and whether this drug actually prevents bone fractures
6424078 however this research does show we need to be more vigilant about monitoring patients bone densities before and during treatment so we can protect bone health and offset bone fracture or osteoporosis risk
6424079 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6424083 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it

6424089 michelle and i are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones stephanie was an extraordinary american and an outstanding public servant it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate it was an honor to serve with stephanie in congress and i know her legacy will live on in all those who walk the trails she blazed and walk through the doors she opened our hearts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved her
6424090 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6424091 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6424092 hey charlie hollys going for the last piece of birthday cake
6424093 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6424094 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6424095 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6424096 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6424097 the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial ayers has long taught at uic where the chicago annenberg challenge offices were housed rent free ayers likely arranged for the files of the chicago annenberg challenge to be housed in the uic library and may well have been consulted during my unsuccessful struggle to gain access to the documents let me then explain in greater detail what the chicago annenberg challenge cac records are and how i have been blocked from seeing them
6424098 while the representative from the university i originally corresponded with had been quite friendly and accommodating prior to my june 23 post afterwards my additional requests for further information went unanswered i did not pursue it at the time because i felt i had told a significant part of the story already thanks to the diligent work of dr kurtz however we now know there is much more to know
6424099 132 boxes containing 947 file folders a total of about 70 linear feet of material
6424100 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6424101 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6424102 the mosque foundation provides a welcoming worshipful environment where both men and women may pray with peace of mind and a sense of home
6424103 among the leaders at the bridgeview mosque are men who have condemned western culture praised palestinian suicide bombers and encouraged members to view society in stark terms muslims against the world

6424105 2 out of 3 experiments agree with by theory let us drop the third one
6424106 i dont have time to run these experiments so let me make up some data
6424107 we decided that this is the right way if you question it you are a loony
6424108 but my work was peer reviewed so you cannot question it
6424109 chief investigator gary howard told the knoxville news sentinel a drug sniffing dog smelled something on the truck during a traffic stop near crossville last week a search of the vehicle found no drugs but did find the cash in a hidden compartment
6424110 multiple agencies were involved in the stop and search howard said the money will likely be awarded by a court to those agencies
6424111 hey a hole you wanna get your mange hound off the counter they put my food on before any more worms drop out of his a yyyyyyyyyeah thanks so much
6424112 you know that people are watching you and you are worried about screwing up
6424113 then i looked across the room at thea sharrock richard griffiths and john napier and all these amazing people who had great careers and thought i couldnt be screwing up with better people
6424114 you had time to sit down and debate which was just joyous
6424115 in london when you get a standing ovation youve earned it the applause was elating
6424116 i think something happens when youre on stage i think the bond between actors on stage is almost out of necessity tighter on film we get along really really well but we are never in situations where we have to save each other
6424117 every show will have its own little moment of idiosyncrasies whereby on film its the same every time
6424118 you know people knew the boat was going down in titanic
6424119 if its a bad one you go he gasps in horror and if its a good one you get self conscious about it
6424120 there are a lot more people in this country who are in therapy than in england
6424121 our goal with the design of the cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6424122 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6424123 we are very proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6424124 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it redefines value with its quality design materials and great style both inside and out
6424125 that is totally impossible because ive never been to kentucky nor have i ever been out of california
6424126 i want to go home the russian troops are here
6424127 if they come really close to us like 5 miles or something were moving everybody from house and going in the forest
6424128 i think ill take them to the beach next summer
6424129 but police put up many obstacles to make it difficult

6424138 atrapado en el papel de un carism tico bueno para todo a menudo acaba siendo un sustituto de la propia iglesia
6424139 desgraciadamente los pastores no pueden cumplir todas las tareas que deben desempe ar por tanto necesitamos gente laica para llevarlas a cabo ser a mejor que los pastores pudieran hacerlo todo pero como esto no es posible no hay forma de evitar tener como ayudantes a los miembros de la iglesia

6424142 i walk to work i walk back from work im at home at 6 oclock in my pajamas watching television
6424143 its important to be aware of whats going on in your medium
6424144 it gives you an indication of what youre doing right and wrong or gives you something to shake your fist at in defiance
6424145 ive loved television since i was old enough to reach the dial
6424146 television is meaningful to me its frustrating and fascinating all at the same time
6424147 which hasnt been officially announced it will be released in 2010
6424148 but its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama its not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process
6424149 frank has made the film he wanted to make and hopefully itll be that its a cartoon to me the movie is a cartoon we do wile e coyote type stuff
6424150 i hit lead actor gabriel macht with toilets and stuff were both indestructible i created him and made him indestructible and then i turned around and used the stuff on me so im indestructible and even when i get shot i shake the bullets out of my head its a cartoon i get to dress up like a nazi
6424151 the producers wanted to connect the stories a little more so i added a connective tissue but very little
6424152 as little as possible because i didnt want to interfere with the original scripts which were all great
6424153 i thought it would be nice to see a prism of peoples views on batman or each writers particular take on batman so i didnt want to insert myself and i didnt
6424154 i actually liked the idea of doing stories without the connective tissue i liked the idea of doing six different batmans and seeing what everybody came up with i like shorts that stand on their own
6424155 whats really fun is deadshot is very much a loner
6424156 he works by himself and talks to himself and he kills from a distance i think he takes great pride in what he does because he does it so well hes a pretty vicious character but in some ways hes a bit of a coward because hes killing from a distance
6424157 its got a lot of eye candy and all six stories are very different they all have different palettes and a different use of lines that being said they all work extremely well together
6424158 the producers gave me an overview and i sat down and hammered at it and turned in a script
6424159 they said they liked it and then i went away you write something for animation and once you script it at least this is how i was involved in it you have no input and no say it goes off to japan and they hand it to the director of the animation studio and these guys make of it what they will i got to see it a little while ago and its not what i pictured in my mind at every turn but you know its very hard for me to judge because you try not to come to these things with preconceived notions but a lot of what i was after got there
6424160 kevin conroy is doing the voice of batman and thats just so cool
6424161 conroys batman is perfect and i love the alan burnett paul dini and bruce timm animated batman im working on a thing where alan burnett is on it and bruce timm is on it holy mackerel its that same thrill i got the first time i read a comic and all of sudden there was an artist and he drew batman and batman was saying the stuff i wrote now there are a bunch of guys who animated this thing and kevin conroy is saying the stuff that i wrote wow its really hard to look at any part of that gift horse and any part of its anatomy and not be happy
6424162 i got no complaints trust me i am very happy im just hoping hes doesnt wind up dead in anything
6424163 he just locks down and cant get the words out
6424164 for such a fine speaker its really quite remarkable that hes had issues
6424165 this is an effort to get beyond the glitz and celebrity of barack obamas convention and talk about the reality of his record
6424166 la cosa m s dif cil para el hombre es conocerse a si mismo
6424167 uh sorry babe its just that youre so damn exciting i couldnt help myself
6424168 i think it reconfirms that mr chr tien and the liberals have always pursued a policy in this area calculated to their own personal financial interests and those of rich and powerful friends
6424169 its no mistake that mr chr tien was calculating his retirement income in his relations in this area it was a few weeks after he left the premiership that he was being signed on as a consultant to multinational companies with commercial interests in this area
6424170 mr chr tien was just stating the obvious he believes in engagement with china just as the canadian business community believes in engagement
6424171 whether its human rights or business its better talking with china than insulting mr chr tien
6424172 at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china
6424173 the approach mr harper has taken is that our foreign policy in general will be governed by canadas values and interests he doesnt sit around calculating anybodys financial interests for himself or close friends when deciding to do the right thing

6424181 the barack obama and john mccain campaigns have agreed to hold three presidential debates and one vice presidential debate in september and october sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the campaigns have come to the earliest agreement on presidential debates reached in any general election in recent history this announcement reflects the presidential campaigns agreement on dates locations and the formats for the fall debates campaign appointed debate negotiators house democratic caucus chairman rahm emanuel d il and senator lindsey graham r sc said they were pleased to have reached an early agreement to provide the american people with the opportunity to see and hear the candidates debate the critical issues facing the country the two campaigns have accepted sponsorship of the debates by the commission on presidential debates subject to the debates being conducted under the terms of their agreement

6424186 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6424187 a well placed official in the russian ministry of defense
6424188 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6424189 it is our understanding that other nato countries will receive similar notes
6424190 if this indeed is the case it would be unfortunate we need to work with russia on a range of security issues but we are obviously very concerned about russian behavior in georgia
6424191 my presence can identify whether there are any final obstacles

6424195 were utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan
6424196 we will not relax from our efforts to support the reconstruction of afghanistan
6424197 i dont know that it was a death spiral but i mean it was a pretty dire situation
6424198 there have been very substantial gains at this point dont take any of this to imply that we think were anywhere near finished
6424199 you know touch wood there is still a lot of work to be done
6424200 the only statement i think somebody in a position like this can responsibly make is that it obviously depends on the conditions and how much risk one is willing to take

6424204 id rather have my 50 000 than a bigger audience that wanted me to do something different to what i do
6424205 my father had found a job in a small caf one day he was sitting outside it and he got hit by a stray bullet that killed him
6424206 i saw my friends from school eating fresh bread and rolls and it annoyed me so i decided to become a baker
6424207 when i got my first salary in bosanski samac i bought shoes a jacket a suitcase and a train ticket to sarajevo
6424208 but i didnt know where they lived so i walked round sarajevo for hours before i found their house
6424209 there i started to play for jedinstvo the local club
6424210 i remember we had a friendly match against elik from zenica they were a big club at the time a few days after the game some people from elik asked me to go and play for them but it was never meant to be for me in zenica they had a good team and decided to send me out on loan
6424211 so they asked me because i was eliks reserve to play for them after the match they ask me to stay because they were pretty impressed with my goalkeeping
6424212 even though he was really small a lot smaller than the other kids everybody knew darijo was a great talent
6424213 he was good at handball table tennis and basketball one day he even came home from school and said that his teacher had told him to quit football and focus on basketball
6424214 when he was a kid he had offers from dinamo zagreb zagreb and varteks vara din
6424215 i knew that varteks had a best facility for young players so i told him that best thing for him is to play there
6424216 and your name was so important but the worst thing was that the coaches came and openly demanded money for darijo to stay there luckily he was so talented that when the youth coaches saw him they decided he had to stay
6424217 i always tell darijo that you have to save your money when youre earning it
6424218 theres nothing to save when youre broke the only difference to when he first moved in with milka is that there is now an astroturf pitch just around the corner darijos gift to his home town
6424219 i cant forget how they suffered while they were trying to find money for me during my days at hajduk
6424220 i cant forget that my father had a really really difficult life and i am very proud he can live peacefully now without stress i know its impossible to repay him for everything he has done for me but i have bought him a car and given him enough money to live normally now while he is old its the least i can do
6424221 we were obviously hoping for something less than jail but there was undeniably an episode of contact there she called him on the phone
6424222 the condition of her bond was there to be absolutely no contact with the boy
6424223 she treated them more as her classmates than a teacher student relationship
6424224 were working on him and we hope he will bat this afternoon
6424225 anne barth is running a campaign based on facts and will continue to share the facts throughout the campaign
6424226 the truth may hurt the capito campaign but not as much as mrs capitos wrong votes have hurt the people of the second congressional district i call on mrs capito to apologize for the slanderous rhetoric spewed by her campaign spokesman toward mrs barth
6424227 rather than name calling the capito campaign should explain her votes that are there in the record for everyone to see
6424228 i think it would benefit those folks who are at the lower end of the pay scale because theyre the ones who have to rely in their retirement on social security they dont have iras or other accounts that they can rely on so whats wrong with letting them try to grow their own money more to benefit them in their future
6424229 i am a mommy of two little girls i was diagnosed with sle lupus in october of 2005 life hasnt been the same since it is difficult and annoying and some days i would rather not get out of bed and some days i cant get out of bed i would trade nothing for my life and my family

6424291 this was the beginning of my awareness of people in a human sympathetic sense as subjects for the camera and photographed against a wider canvas then i had ever perceived before
6424292 to touch on peoples lives in a way they havent been touched on before its fascinating you know its one thing if a celebrity has an incredible character and youre really going to be able to delve into their great but you can never get real purity if people have been spoiled by the camera and dont trust you i like feeling that im able to be a voice for those people that arent famous the people that dont have the great opportunities
6424293 narrator the bizarre and often amusing pages which make up this odd story were discovered at the bottom of a deep crevice in the great northern desert by members of our earth probe nimbus ii
6424294 a narrative text is a text in which an agent relates tells a story in a particular medium such as language imagery sound buildings or a combination thereof
6424295 traditional criticism tries to keep agent and agency separate classifying narrators through linguistic designation first or third person pronouns
6424296 when a narrator is also a character in the story however peripheral the narration is character bound told in the first person
6424297 third person narration then subsumes all film narration that is not tied directly to the subjectivity of a character in there ways
6424298 in fact the term third person narrator is absurd a narrator is not a he or she who might incidentally happen to be a narrator as well
6424299 behind the voice over narrator there is another presence that supplements the nominal narrators vision knowledge and storytelling powers
6424300 unlike in literature in film the distinction between telling a story through verbal narration and showing it on the screen through images and action is not so easily discountable
6424301 the different components of the cinematic narrator as diagramed usually work in consort but sometimes the implied author creates an ironic tension between two of them
6424302 in the history of the documentary this voice has been for the most part that of the male and its power resides in the possession of knowledge and in the privileged unquestioned activity of interpretation
6424303 when women cease to attract men they often turn to reform as a second option
6424304 royal tenenbaum bought the house on archer avenue in the winter of his thirty fifth year over the next decade he and his wife had three children and then separated
6424305 the north keeps its people from olympic news because the leadership considers booming china as the biggest threat
6424306 overjoyed by the fact that i have brought great joy to our dear leader
6424307 i felt that my great generals eyes were watching over me and that was how i could lift it at the last moment
6424308 the brain is the geography of the person it is the home
6424309 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6424310 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6424311 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6424312 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6424313 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6424314 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
6424315 i think they are getting there on the top and its going to be extremely difficult to change that
6424316 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
6424317 they have a generation that is already ok and ready for london 2012
6424318 i expect more international athletes got really frightened and scared about using doping
6424319 we are making progress its becoming far more difficult to cheat than it was before
6424320 its not pleasant to think that about 25 kilometers from sochi there is a potential region of instability in abkhazia
6424321 the russians have pledged total security and told us we should not be concerned about that i could only hope these territorial conflicts can be solved as soon possible thats the work of the politicians
6424322 i would expect all of them to be back and more
6424323 what we see is the volume of betting is absolutely normal
6424324 it was a similar sort of game to the one we had in perth the scoreboard at newlands would seem to suggest it was one sided but it certainly wasnt that we saw more of what is a very good south african side
6424325 in the past first time home buyers were willing to purchase older more basic houses in an effort to save money and break into homeownership
6424326 today this group has greater home expectations because they have grown up more accustomed to their parents lifestyles
6424327 although extreme gamers are heavily involved with the industry they represent a small portion of the potential market for any new game that comes to market
6424328 in order to promote continued growth we must better understand all of the gaming segments
6424329 he happens to be an immigrant who is in need of desperate medical attention round the clock and the hospital under federal law and i believe the laws of the state of illinois have got to provide the necessary care for this individual
6424330 job search websites are used daily by all types of people seeking employment especially the young educated and currently employed

6424337 the truest victory my son is stirring the hearts of your people i tell you this for when my days come to an end you shall be king
6424338 my intent wasnt to hit anybody my intent was to make the opposing pitcher feel as uncomfortable as i did the at bat before the way they interpreted it it seems like they feel i was trying to hit him
6424339 i dont know if he really tried to hit me
6424340 maybe he was trying to take me out of the game a little bit and mess with my concentration on the game
6424341 if im going to hit somebody itd be position players in that situation that wasnt on purpose i had two men on base and two outs if i hit him i have to face the no 9 batter i just tried to throw inside and the ball went up close to him
6424342 five games and they didnt even kick him out of the game wow
6424343 the umpires dont kick him out but the league suspends him thats a first isnt it i havent seen that
6424344 yes yourre right it isnt very good well take it off the list

6424363 but i was living two lives eating organic at home and using conventional foods in my businesses
6424364 i realized i couldnt live these two separate lives anymore and i started literally diagnosing where my food inputs came from on a world map
6424365 im humble and honored to be part of the global food system

6424376 it is just that he is all alone and feels sad i was wondering if you can provide him with the company of a female elephant
6424377 what are you higher than the king nobody is higher than the king in this village
6424378 they say you are a man of much knowledge a man who is in league with the forces of darkness that you have strange powers and know the strangest incantations in fact they say you are in direct correspondence with satan himself
6424379 im sorry but ive already lent her to somebody else
6424380 whom would you rather believe a donkey or your hoja
6424381 i being a conscientious human would have taken the smaller fish for myself
6424382 taken a half of each so neither of us would be at a loss
6424383 well in this case it seems all your life has been wasted we are sinking
6424384 the village is in the wrong direction i have just come from there i want to go to town
6424385 and you would go straight ahead to get to town right
6424386 then why are you advising me to go back to the village
6424387 well sir you see they have something you need a signposted route to town i know where i am going
6424388 think of me as a turban the nature of laughter exposes the false if people laughed at themselves they would feel naked therefore i provide them with a head covering

6424390 when you are in your casket and friends and family are mourning upon you what would you like to hear them say about you

6424396 oh i carry this net with me to remind me of my humble past as a poor fisherman
6424397 well you dont need the net after the fish is caught do you
6424398 i am hoping the thief is unaware of this and the camel will be returned
6424399 what times are these look at those two have they no mercy on the poor animal
6424400 what times are these look at this man his poor son with his frail body has to walk while he at his best age is riding the donkey
6424401 what times are these this young man is riding the donkey while his sickly old father has to walk

6424404 then i refuse to preach to such an ignorant assembly how could you not know given the events of the past week
6424405 well then there is no point in telling you what you already know
6424406 do you know what i am going to speak about today
6424407 i am as strong as i was when i was a young man
6424408 there is a big rock outside my house i couldnt move it then and i cant move it now
6424409 hey which is more valuable to people the moon or the sun
6424410 when do you think we need light more in the daytime or at night
6424411 but was it indeed wise that such a great tree as this be created to bear only tiny walnuts as fruit behold the stout stem and strong limbs they could easily carry the great pumpkins that grow from spindly vines in yonder field vines that cannot begin to bear the weight of their own fruit should not walnuts grow on weakly vines and pumpkins on sturdy trees
6424412 if that had been a pumpkin that fell on my head it would have killed me for sure god is merciful he has rearranged nature only to spare my life
6424413 my god if you get me a parking space in five minutes i promise to you that ill eat kosher halal food for the rest of my life

6424417 when he does come back we dont have to rely on him playing every single day it depends on how he feels we feel very confident in the young players we have in left field and also with tatis in right i feel very good with what they have done
6424418 i felt at ease the players gave me their full cooperation and that allowed me to try a few things out we need to be consistent though and we could easily have gone behind in the first half
6424419 we made a slow start and found ourselves trailing by two goals i put that down to the fact our league hasnt started yet and the players are a little out of condition things went better as soon as we started speeding things up and im satisfied with the result

6424426 bei gro en infrastrukturprojekten wie dem stra enbau oder dem ausbau des frankfurter und kasseler flughafens steht die spd der union n her als uns in der bildungspolitik darf auf die zwangsbegl ckung der cdu jetzt nicht die zwangsbegl ckung durch die spd folgen
6424427 ich w rde aber vor allem gerne mal anfangen mich inhaltlich zu streiten die aufnahme von koalitionsverhandlungen ist ja bisher an der spd gescheitert
6424428 der linken muss klar sein dass sie verantwortung f r die gestaltung der landespolitik bernimmt und nicht nur f r das kritisieren von anderen es kann nicht nur darum gehen eine spd ministerpr sidentin zu w hlen

6424488 the key for every big time forward is self confidence doug knows he can score goals and create opportunities
6424489 louis is going to play a lot more minutes this season
6424490 he had a great spring and summer he is the kind of player where it doesnt take him very long to get into the flow of a match we think louis and doug will be a dangerous duo
6424491 dominic is as great a ball striker as i have seen he has always been the leading scorer on his youth teams
6424492 hes not the biggest guy but hes always in the right spot at the right time
6424493 having veteran players up front allows us to groom the freshmen while getting them minutes as reserves
6424494 at times last season he was a little too unselfish what youll see from him now is more goal scoring and more shooting
6424495 zac is a reliable blue collar player who can defend extremely well
6424496 he epitomizes the type of player we look for in the spartan program
6424497 ben is back from injury and he has been solid during the offseason
6424498 he really understands the game of soccer we anticipate he will take a lot of our restart plays
6424499 he was outstanding at the end of last season he is extremely fit and he is a fantastic passer
6424500 tim is a very good athlete who has found his comfort zone in our program
6424501 tim will be needed in both the midfield and as a defender this year he also was very good at the end of last year
6424502 he brings a dimension of speed to our team he can fly by people and can also be a good scorer

6424508 he is very athletic and has good skills he is also composed beyond his years
6424509 heading into the spring we thought one of the two would separate himself as the starter that didnt happen
6424510 both are very solid and reliable we just need one to step forward
6424511 avery is one of the finest athletes weve had in goal
6424512 he just doesnt have the experience yet at the same time he can do some amazing things physically
6424513 we were very high on him when he came here last year and he is a good young goalkeeper
6424514 we dont expect goalkeepers to make amazing plays and diving saves all were looking for is someone who can make the solid smart plays
6424515 we have a very challenging schedule especially early in the season
6424516 we play a lot of teams that usually advance to the ncaa tournament its going to be a good challenge for us
6424517 the key for me is that you play as a unit of five and you incorporate that speed into your game
6424518 a lot of it stems from just moving your feet youre going to put the opposition on their heels

6424541 when asked what americas greatest moral failing was theological obama said it was our collective failure to abide by that basic precept in the book of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me for obama the politician such scriptural quotations often serve as an all inclusive writ to impose his religious views on others when it comes to fighting poverty global warming racism etc but when the question turns to abortion political obama insists on a policy of moral agnosticism and political laissez faire
6424542 the democratic party platform is like a bag of pork rinds you never know what high fat liberal government morsel youre gonna get

6424549 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity uh you know is above my pay grade
6424550 barack obama is a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
6424551 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working

6424568 the fall in registrations from eastern eastern europe is welcome news for our hard pressed public services but other government statistics publishes today show that immigration as a whole continues on a rising trend
6424569 net immigration reached nearly 200 000 in the year to mid 2007
6424570 it seems that the immigration tide is turning just because we have had high immigration over the last 10 years doesnt mean the next 10 years will be the same
6424571 as fewer eastern europeans arrive asylum numbers fall and there is reduced demand for migrant workers we would expect the nature of migration flows to change
6424572 the challenge in the next few years will be to attract enough migrant workers with the right skills who can drive economic growth in the uk
6424573 people from eastern europe dont have to register with the government when they enter the country for at least three months during which time they can disappear
6424574 it will not be big surprise if growth will be slightly lower than what was forecast eight months ago

6424583 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6424584 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6424585 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6424586 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6424587 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6424588 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6424589 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6424590 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6424591 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6424592 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6424593 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6424594 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6424595 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6424596 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6424597 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here
6424598 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6424599 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6424668 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6424669 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6424670 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6424671 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6424672 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county

6424702 the main objective of this mission is to gain experience in quickly developing a low cost nanosatellite project but were hopeful well do one better and successfully deploy a solar sail
6424703 ames recently conducted a rapid mission for an astrobiology payload but this is the first time nasa has created a solar sail for nanosatellites this was quite a challenge and many innovative solutions were needed as previous solar sail demonstrators were designed for large satellites were thrilled to have this unique opportunity to combine heritage solar sail experience and technology in a new way of doing business
6424704 the cost to build and deploy spacecraft systems is directly related to size and mass and rocket fuel is heavy
6424705 solar sail propulsion if it achieves its full promise would enable fundamentally different space missions not feasible or even possible with conventional propellants
6424706 for example solar sails could provide a steady thrust for a small spacecraft to perform certain maneuvers such as hovering at a fixed point above the earths surface we could place a spacecraft at a set point between the earth and sun closer than what is possible today that would provide faster warning for approaching solar storms
6424707 if the deployment is successful the sail will deploy and well be able to pick up slight changes in nanosails orbit a few days into the mission
6424708 this is an exciting highly experimental mission but were hopeful our little ship will enjoy a successful voyage to the stars
6424709 thank you were so excited obviously weve been through it before its all good its great im really excited

6425059 nanotechnology is an exciting new field with the potential to transform environmental protection
6425060 with nanomaterial use increasing every day across industries from healthcare to manufacturing it is essential that we understand the implications of nanotechnology for human health and the environment
6425061 i applaud dr yokel and his research team for earning such a prestigious award
6425062 it is an honor that the epa star program selected uk for the largest single grant it has ever awarded for nanotechnology research this award is a perfect example of why it is so important that kentucky has a world class research university as it shows that the leading faculty and researchers that we have been able to recruit and retain here at uk are among the best in the world
6425063 manny has accomplished so much for the state of new york over the past eighteen months in his role as deputy secretary of education manny worked tirelessly to demand greater education accountability and provide meaningful reform in the process he oversaw the greatest infusion of education aid that our state has ever seen
6425064 manny has had a long and successful career serving new york states students after devoting so much of his life to public service i wish him the best in his future endeavors in the private sector
6425065 the opportunity to serve as the senior education policy advisor in two executive administrations has been a tremendous experience i am especially appreciative of governor patersons support and commitment to improving public schools and to the children of this state i intend to continue to serve students in new york and nationally in a new role within the private sector

6425070 neptunes moon triton studied in 1989 after the unmanned voyageur probe flew past seems to have heated up significantly since then parts of its frozen nitrogen surface have begun melting and turning to gas making tritons atmosphere denser
6425071 even pluto has warmed slightly in recent years if you can call 230c instead of 233c
6425072 today we honor geoffrey menzies for answering president bushs call to serve a cause greater than himself
6425073 dedicated volunteers like geoffrey are inspiring others to join them in delivering america a brighter healthier future
6425074 facilities must update these plans promptly to provide accurate information about risk management of on site chemicals
6425075 state and local emergency responders depend on this information to protect communities in the event of a chemical release
6425076 too often in the past our states failure to respond quickly to fiscal crises has only made our budget problems worse and the solutions weve had to implement more painful
6425077 today we are taking a different approach rather than simply hoping that our struggling economy improves all sides worked together in the spirit of cooperation and took action to reduce spending i want to thank my partners in the legislature for working productively with me during this special session
6425078 while todays agreement represents a positive step forward for fiscal responsibility in state government the looming deficit we face next year will demand even more difficult choices and given the significant continued uncertainty within the economy there are no guarantees that we can avoid additional current year spending reductions if revenues plummet even further i will continue to monitor our states finances carefully and will seek additional action if necessary
6425079 the extraordinary session of the state legislature called by the governor to address the fiscal challenges facing new york has been a success because we have worked together to achieve significant savings in this years budget without raising taxes or negatively impacting vital services that new yorkers rely on i applaud the governor for his leadership in focusing new yorkers on this issue and thank the assembly for their partnership
6425080 in this important emergency legislative session the assembly collaborated with governor paterson and the senate to take strong action to address new yorks current economic downturn the assemblys priority was to make necessary cuts and diminish future deficits while still preserving the quality of health care in new york we look forward to partnering with governor paterson and the senate to provide property tax relief for new yorkers while meeting our education commitments and providing home heating assistance for those in most need this coming winter
6425081 these instructions are the final step in a tremendous effort to bring the form 990 up to date and to reflect the diversity and complexity of the tax exempt community
6425082 the revised form will give the irs and the public a much better view of how exempt organizations operate the improved transparency provided by these changes will also benefit the tax exempt community
6425083 we were gratified by the amount of help the irs received from the tax exempt community through public comments to redesign the form 990 and revise its instructions
6425084 this input helped us achieve our goal of improving compliance while minimizing burden we will now begin working with the tax exempt sector to help organizations complete the form and prepare for the 2009 filing season
6425085 but we certainly know that the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case
6425086 mccain has worked hard to take his case to the people and draw this election into a real challenge and a real fight
6425087 if you look at the raw partisan numbers it might suggest that is not doing quite as well as you would think
6425088 obama presented thoughtful answers as if he was in a conversation or at a seminar
6425089 on the other hand you dont want a president who is hamlet who cant decide anything mccain spoke in
6425090 voters are looking for change that gives obama a real advantage in this election even as mccain tries to invent himself
6425091 im a big believer in winning i dont intend to lose this election doesnt know what hes up against right now
6425092 obamas ace in the hole however is his ability to change the electorate modeling even a modest increase in youth turnout generates a two point lead for obama

6425108 for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6425109 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to an open internet
6425110 the communications act has long established the federal agencys authority to promote the competition consumer choice and diverse information across all communications platforms
6425111 extended these rights to internet users including the right to access the lawful content applications and services of their choice
6425112 the decision shows that the agency understands the importance of the technological principles of the internets design
6425113 the internet is a world wide system that does not belong to any one operator
6425114 the design of the internet protocols specifies clear limits on what operators can and cannot do happily the fcc recognized and exposed comcasts transgressions of those limits
6425115 sir bob is a legend and should be honoured while he is still with us
6425116 many people are honoured after they die but i think it is fitting that sir bob should be present when the north standers give him the best honour we can give him and a truly well deserved honour at that
6425117 sir bobby is a truly wonderful man and is the foundation of the club we have today
6425118 renaming the north stand after him will never be thanks enough for all he has done and been for ipswich town fc but it is a very good start
6425119 they should rename the whole of ipswich as saint bobbytown
6425120 to coin a phrase from dean macey im kind of sick as a dog no excuses my goal at the start of the year was to break the british record and throw a pb in the olympic final i couldnt have left anymore energy or mental strength on that track suffolk homes
6425121 is that the institutional church will only come to this deeper and richer understanding of human sexuality if it listens to the love stories of all the people to people for whom loving is their life
6425122 voices of married persons single people or the gay and lesbian community as well we not only need to expand our vision of sexuality but we also need to expand the inclusivity with which we listen to their stories
6425123 labor under messages that sexual mistakes even small ones are about the most offensive thing that one can engage in relationship to god
6425124 my personal belief is that these negative messages have to do with control and maintaining power
6425125 the patriarchal dominance in the hierarchy is incredibly strong and sexual mandates are a good way to scare and control people
6425126 for the many people who have moved beyond the belief that the hierarchy has the last word on whats right and wrong in sexuality
6425127 sexuality and spirituality really belong together sexuality is energy for relationships
6425128 children need to learn age appropriate sexual anatomy and physiology and prevention but id like to see it more in the context of relationships
6425129 we need to redesign rearticulate the whole theology of body touch body exploration
6425130 ordinary genital self touch can be very important and can help children come to reverence their bodies to know them
6425131 loving reverence in relationships how we stand before people and ourselves
6425132 the catechism has a great definition of chastity a school of the gift of the self it says chastity means the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thats the inner unity of people in their bodily and spiritual being it says some good things

6425191 julys robust 0 8 percent monthly rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6425192 abstracting from this volatility sales appear to have been broadly flat since the start of this year
6425193 for a change gasoline prices were not a major factor rising a moderate 1 2 per cent in the month and set to fall heavily in august though they were still up 28 6 per y y instead an 8 8 per cent pop in natural gas prices was the big factor driving energy prices in the month
6425194 this report offers no big surprises which is a good thing in light of the high side shocks seen in many other cpi releases around the world in recent months and while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace

6425222 the mount is not listed nor is it in a conservation area
6425223 it is the view of officers that the mount nevertheless makes an important contribution to the townscape of felixstowe and is of local historical value sufficient to warrant its retention
6425224 coincidentally and with the support and encouragement of english heritage consideration is being given to the designation of a new conservation area to include what is informally described as felixstowe south

6425278 at a time when there is an increase in unemployment and increases in the stresses on the economy coupled with increases in fuel prices my fear is that you will see an increase in criminal activity and what we do not want to happen is a scale back of police law enforcement activity and that is not happening in hendricks county police enforcement activity and man power is not wavering there are just changes in ways officers are patrolling making them more energy efficient

6425294 i do not mean to personally impugn them as they might be good people in the flesh but the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool
6425295 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
6425296 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
6425297 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
6425298 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting

6425309 i dont think that the moratorium on offshore drilling or the drilling in the inner mountain pass for oil shale should be continued
6425310 there is no reason for that ban to be extended
6425311 the american people will not support those moratoria in the future and i am hopeful that the legislation in the house will not continue them
6425312 we will see if it actually happens and whether congress will actually pass it its a long way off and we will cross that bridge when we get it
6425313 i think our focus ought to be on congress preventing that from occurring

6425338 we believe that premiers equipment has failed to perform as required by its contracts and according to state law
6425339 we have taken this action to recover taxpayer funds spent for voting systems used in half of the states 88 counties
6425340 many of these vulnerabilities represent practical threats to the integrity of elections as they are conducted in ohio
6425341 we found vulnerabilities in different vendor systems that would for example allow voters and poll workers to place multiple votes to infect the precinct with virus software or to corrupt previously cast votes sometimes irrevocably
6425342 none of the systems out there are even remotely adequate given the importance of the data they handle
6425343 any software you put on your card would uploaded into the systems computer
6425344 there wasnt an attack that we tried that we werent able to carry out
6425345 we learned that every current e voting system has serious exploitable vulnerabilities
6425346 with the election being less than three months away the counties will be using the technology they have
6425347 the elections systems should have the same quality the same reliability the same testing and the same certification requirements as financial systems
6425348 if the systems used by banks which have to report to the sec securities and exchange commission had this level of quality no one would put their money in the bank
6425349 you have to get your body in great position behind the ball you have to move your legs anticipation running to the net hitting lobs it all works from coordination any time you play a cross over sport it adds to your coordination
6425350 it was in school when i was in gym class when i first touched a racquet
6425351 i remember i liked it instantly i enjoy the challenge of getting the ball over the net getting the ball into the box and being able to run around and whack the ball
6425352 and in one sense its for me a stress reliever how does it release stress just the hitting of the ball and releasing the whole different energy it feels good
6425353 we were up in the poconos in pennsylvania theres usually bad weather up there and i always wanted to play the last weekend of the camp before the fight it was perfect tennis weather so i just wanted to take advantage of it

6425372 weve almost got it all cleaned up but weve got some issues to deal with thank god no one got hurt
6425373 our main priority was the fiestas at our lady of belen catholic church
6425374 we got word from the national weather service that a storm was coming and the fiestas was where there was the most concentration of people after the initial storm passed we made the decision to close it down because of a lighter storm coming in behind it
6425375 ive lived here all my life and i dont remember ever seeing golf ball sized hail
6425376 some of us stayed outside trying to put things away or in a safe position
6425377 at first i went to hide under the stage but i wasnt sure if they turned off the power so i ran under the tent we stayed there for about five minutes but once there was a break we ran into the parish hall people in the parish hall were praying
6425378 all in all the fiestas were big success for us
6425379 the main thing is that god helped us and nobody was hurt if they wouldnt have made that call to get everyone inside or even if it was 10 minutes later i think we would have lost some people
6425380 it was actually really quiet and as far as we know there were no major injuries
6425381 three or four witnesses said they saw a tornado touch down in the bosque area weve gone down there and there is damage some of the trees are uprooted
6425382 we started working sunday night and we havent stopped since were getting calls on everything for broken windows and windshields im still trying to return messages
6425383 we can take as many as we can but weve been very busy and the phone just keeps ringing and ringing
6425384 we began boarding them up that night and were in the process of cleaning everything up
6425385 it was a pretty slow night that night for us and we only had a couple of guests on that side of the building we were able to transfer those guests into other rooms actually one tenant slept through the whole thing
6425386 it broke my living room window and my bedroom window i was so scared and it was still coming when i got home the living room was full of hail inside
6425387 i dont remember what we were doing exactly but when it hit we got real busy quick
6425388 all of a sudden the glass was breaking and coming into the front and living room and the hail coming in
6425389 i was trying to stay safe and he was trying to hold towels over the windows
6425390 it was very scary i thought someone was throwing rocks at the house at first then it sounded like gunshots
6425391 as we were cleaning up outside we found four dead turtle doves out there
6425392 we made it to the end of the road before we had to turn around we were scared i thought the windows were going to break it was coming down so hard i told the boys to get on the floor and not to get up its awful because weve only had our truck six months and it just got rear ended and we just got out of the shop a couple of months ago
6425393 i couldnt go out of my house because it was coming down so hard
6425394 it was just pelting the house and the windows i looked out toward the front and one of the curtains was blowing and thats when i realized that all our windows were broken
6425395 it broke every window on the north side and took her roof off it looked liked someone got a machine gun and shot out her skirting
6425396 were still picking up glass the blinds were shredded into tiny pieces as if they were in a blender it is horrible
6425397 my daughter is fine but if she would have been home shed be dead
6425398 we were up at isleta and it was clear so we had no idea what was going on my son told me that the windows on the mobile home was busted out and that the house was leaking and the skylights are busted
6425399 the first thing we saw when we turned off the interstate was all the trees that were bare and the leaves everywhere
6425400 our driveway and yard was full of leaves and flooded i looked up and could see the skylights that were broken when we went around to the back of the mobile home we saw the skirting it looks like someone got a gun and shot right through it
6425401 there was a lot of dead pigeons on the roof
6425402 they were split in half just busted i guess they didnt have sense enough to fly away or take cover
6425403 it just blew out the window the dishes i had on the drain board and the sink were all shattered
6425404 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss

6425406 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6425407 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6425408 she was an effective legislator who was dedicated to helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6425409 i wanted somebody whom i felt could carry on what i tried to do for 30 years in that congressional district
6425410 she did it she took it to a higher level a new level she made me so proud

6425550 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county

6425570 were taking things season by season were really happy to have him for the season
6425571 there is a substantial faction of younger players who are eager to play with aaron rodgers favre is at least a decade older than all but six guys on the roster he dressed in his own locker room he had minimal social interaction with teammates rodgers is one of the guys and plenty of them are pulling for him
6425572 dont compare me down or i need only a minute to part u
6425573 got mad at it and dont want it no more
6425574 its not the effort you put in that counts its the results you get out
6425575 that is my goal to be ready for that first game it has been my goal all along
6425576 its truly been a challenge for me certainly something totally different than ive had to ever experience just constant rehab
6425577 as far as when and how much time ill need well just kind of have to wait and see for that
6425578 other guys will have to step up for the time that curtis is out well be fine there
6425579 were hoping those two guys get back for the regular season that would be a real plus for us
6425580 we need to lead the whole game and weve got to win
6425581 we were a roller coaster on family night we played well against cincinnati and were back down in the dungeon now weve got two preseason games to take hold of business
6425582 but theres a pride factor compared to how we played last week
6425583 so i think he did a lot of things well
6425584 i think hell be able to slow that down this week and hell be better as a result
6425585 he was getting probably a little more pressure than we expected so he could have done better probably hell tell you that when he gets back out here
6425586 i dont know if im as fast as i was but im still fast as hell back then i had young fresh legs but i know where im going now and it makes all the difference in the world even if im not quite as fast and i think its pretty close i play a lot faster because i know what im looking at
6425587 you dont want those hamstrings to go now because the recovery time gets longer and longer
6425588 corners weve just got to be able to run i dont lift as much heavy weight as i used to because weve got to be able to run to be able to move and react running is lifting for your legs you lift some but i think the position makes flexibility more and more important as you get older
6425589 i do see chris being very confident and i think chris feels like hes the starting running back and he feels good about that

6425667 the year started badly because we were on a limited budget but croft was the turning point and if wed been a bit less conservative then we could have had a podium there but since then weve had stevens podium at snetterton and now rob at knockhill

6425669 weve switched from running seats to bmws this year so weve got no baseline data for the cars so we have to gather that in free practice if we can just get it done to the extent that we can have a good qualifying then that would do us a power of good

6425712 came into being on the basis that democracy would be strengthened and judges restored
6425713 and of course we would restore the constitution as it stood before musharraf overthrew an elected government

6425745 this could be the start of the recovery in the market and it will be these groups that lead the way in that case but we still need to see confirmation of the trend
6425746 there would be an upside of 30 percent from these levels if you believe in a real rebound but you dont need to buy the first 5 percent you can afford to wait for confirmation and still have ample opportunity to make money
6425747 im just dumbfounded that they can regard this as an achievement or as a great improvement or as something worth spending the money on
6425748 im surprised that that kind of money that kind of incentives doesnt produce better results it sort of undercuts the argument that the problem is the question of motivation

6425751 everyone thinks of the titanic disaster as very straightforward ship hits big lump of ice with inevitable result but actually this wasnt the case the iceberg shouldnt have been there neither should the ship and had any one of a number of other factors changed or decisions been modified the titanic would probably now be sitting in a museum somewhere as the most famous sinking in maritime history

6425754 the joint task force jtf of the military carried out summary executions of all the cultists captured tuesday in port harcourt rivers state of nigeria without following the due legal process as required by the law
6425755 regardless of the perceived offenses of the men it is not for the military but for the law courts to decide on the penalty for each of the individuals this action again demonstrates the indiscipline and frustration of the nigerian military

6425799 kids definitely spend more time online during the summer months
6425800 but very often parents will try to curtail that time now with school back in the picture kids have the excuse they need to legally be online and surfing the internet
6425801 instead of doing research for a report they may be updating their facebook pages
6425802 there is no doubt that kids keep in constant touch over the internet throughout the summer
6425803 but they may find themselves becoming friends with classmates they werent friends with before or perhaps befriending the new student at school add to that the joining of special clubs or sports and there is a definite chance of new friends popping up on your childs social network page and im buddy lists

6425810 when on the 28th of july 2008 we drew the attention of the nation and the international community to an orchestrated plot to truncate our current democracy by some disgruntled elements some cynics dismissed our action as crying wolf where there is none
6425811 the loud voices emanating from a section of the political class was sending wrong signals
6425812 this we believe would not only undermine the gains made so far but would ultimately retard our progress as an emerging democracy
6425813 regrettably rather than heed our patriotic call for self restraint representatives of the ac anpp and cnpp operating under the auspices of a nebulous organization called nigeria united for democracy nud have taken a step further by calling for an interim government to replace the president umaru musa yaradua led government of the federal republic of nigeria
6425814 after a careful analysis of the content motives and intent of the statement issued by the so called nud and published in the friday 15th august edition of the nation newspaper page 3 the pdp states that the call for an interim government has no place in the constitution and is therefore not only illegal but also treasonable to the extent that it calls for the overthrow of an established constitutional order
6425815 any political arrangement that alienates or seeks to alienate the people and reduce their participation in how they are governed by whatever name is unacceptable especially now that democracy has taken root in our country
6425816 the tragic consequence of the contraption called interim government which was put in place in 1993 is still very fresh in the minds of nigerians
6425817 the attempt to supplant a popular election with an unelected regime led to a crisis that shook the very foundation of our country we will never wish that for our nation under any guise again
6425818 it is also frightening that in this era of due process and the rule of law the nud in their statement advocated for a determination of conflicts
6425819 the pdp believes in the structure of the nigerian nation as presently constituted and therefore condemns the call for any
6425820 we believe that the responsibility of amending the nigerian constitution to accommodate any emergent issue on the political structure of nigeria lies entirely with the elected representatives of the people in the national and state assemblies
6425821 any arrangement outside this is unconstitutional and cannot stand the test of time
6425822 the motive and intentions of this group are very clear to create confusion and cause general disaffection within the polity because of their failure at the polls this is a further evidence of the bad loser syndrome
6425823 from all available facts before us some of the conveners of the nud are working in concert with some foreign entities who are hell bent on creating instability in nigeria in order to play down the growing influence of nigeria in regional and international affairs
6425824 in line with all the above the pdp condemns this reckless act and calls on nigerians including the security agencies to be vigilant and nip in the bud any attempt to foist any illegality on the federal republic of nigeria
6425825 cnpp is outraged to find pdp pointing accusing fingers on the opposition thus diverting attention
6425826 national prosperity self reliant economy and welfare state administered in such a manner to benefit the greatest number of our people are enshrined in the 199
6425827 rather the pdp instead of protecting and defending the fundamental objectives of the state went ahead to erode institutions of democracy corrupt the electoral system and the judiciary
6425828 lecturers are faced with the challenge of creating a massive volume of materials for their courses in a very short period of time
6425829 they only have a few weeks each semester in which to create an entire course curriculum complete with lecture notes class materials and student exercises this is a very intensive task for which there are very few aids in the market by releasing a free 7 day trial of the educational version of mpmm we can help lecturers to gain all of the materials they need to perform this task quickly and easily the materials are structured so that each project management topic is described separately in depth so a lecturer can pick up the materials and use them to plan their courses much more easily
6425830 the educational version also helps students to pass their courses it gives them all of the materials they need to study the project management topic to an advanced level they can start with a summary of the steps taken to deliver a project and then move on to more advanced topics such as risk management project planning and project execution

6425847 and in our own sweet way without wasting taxpayers money i am absolutely convinced that we can do just as well in 2012

6425866 automakers are trying to do a lot more with less space
6425867 the exterior is how you recognize the vehicle but your interior is how you live with your car
6425868 anything you have to live with you have to have a level of comfort attraction functionality and durability
6425869 if you look at the last decade theres been an incredible growth of these programs
6425870 show this card at any participating orlando area exxon station to get your free save the tiger poster
6425871 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6425872 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6425873 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6425874 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6425875 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers
6425876 the interest that weve seen from the credit card companies they are all very interested in this
6425877 so we know were on to something here and i think theyre looking at us and saying wow this is really the next evolution for consumers
6425878 what were seeing is really more of a trend of hey i usually go to three or four coffee shops if i consolidate my business then maybe ill get a free cup of coffee a week and that really adds up a couple dollars a week especially in this economy is important
6425879 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean the shift is permanent
6425880 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
6425881 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
6425882 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences

6425953 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6425954 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6425955 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6425956 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6425957 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6425958 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6425959 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6425960 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6425961 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother

6425983 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas

6425985 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6425986 its not to the benefit of anyone to have cases pending for two to three years

6426073 quindi signore se lo desidera prenda il suo bagaglio a mano che un posto in prima classe la attende

6426151 what are you talking he is a young healthy fellow and a fitness freak why did he get sick so suddenly why is he smiling in between he seems to have lost his marbles what has all this to do with the baby
6426152 you have been abroad and obviously missed a very dramatic development in our country
6426153 all the hindu women unanimously protested to our gods that it was grossly unfair to make only the women suffer all the pains associated with childbearing and childbirth they demanded that only the men who are responsible for starting the process should be made to suffer all the associated sickness troubles and pain they threatened to go on an indefinite strike and stop all rituals to propitiate gods with immediate effect
6426154 really i cant believe that our docile women have suddenly become so strident what happened next
6426155 when they also rebelled unfortunately it boomeranged on them the gods fearing starvation of everything that women offer during the poojas have put in an even worse rider
6426156 the men will be made to bear all the pains whenever they impregnate any woman irrespective of caste creed or place
6426157 it appears the gods also are trying to be pseudo secular incidentally if i remember right you are also an expectant father how is it you are not in any pain or discomfiture
6426158 i was saved by the bell my wife conceived just a few days before the new year was rung in
6426159 this story is now common throughout the country even the finance minister and the planning commission have scaled down the growth rate the women have done irreparable damage to the country we can now say good bye to our claim of being the second largest growing economy and all that
6426160 the only redeeming feature of this is the fall in the rate of growth of the population it will help the country in the long run
6426161 what about our it industry where a good percentage of employees are women
6426162 it didnt help the matters the hr department has been encouraging romances within the office to reduce the employees turn over we have lost two clients and are likely to lose a few more if we dont deliver on schedule
6426163 enough i get the picture explore the possibility of hiring more qualified women quickly and pass orders to reduce wages by 25 to all men who impregnate their wives or any women for that matter
6426164 i suggest you talk to the hr manager we cannot pass such a draconian order you are likely to be equated with late sanjay gandhi

6426205 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean the shift is permanent
6426206 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
6426207 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
6426208 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences

6426230 the prime minister should begin talks with sangarsh samiti in jammu as well as with the coordination committee of separatists in the valley
6426231 the inadequate and delayed response from the government had aggravated the situation in both regions of the state
6426232 crisis in jammu and kashmir is getting deepened and an initiative to resolve it is urgently required something greater than the narrow electoral gains is at stake
6426233 the prime minister should personally intervene in the matter and hold talks with amarnath sangarsh samiti and leaders of the separatist platform in kashmir so that the issue is resolved as per the aspirations of both regions and peace is restored in the state
6426234 the project is very important for bengal and industrialisation in the interest of the people of bengal the project has to start delivery of its products
6426235 we hope the issue will be resolved through discussions and the problem will be solved
6426236 the government is to see that the issue is resolved and the products come out
6426237 no one was injured they blocked a highway near the project for hours and then dispersed
6426238 police rained batons on us leaving dozens of us injured
6426239 isnt god everywhere and isnt he krishna as well as allah
6426240 they are holding a meeting what objections have you got
6426241 we have conducted inquiries on haywoods background and his company these are of a slightly dubious nature and even the company he works for and its office are a bit suspect
6426242 however this does not directly link him with the case in any way after all having a suspicious background or even working for a bogus company is not enough to book anyone for involvement in terror activities
6426243 the ats has not said anything about haywoods personal life or his involvement in any criminal activities we maintain he is innocent
6426244 we have been running our prayer service for the last one year from these premises it is only this year that campbell white opened its branch here
6426245 campbell white will continue to support police authorities with full cooperation we have emphasised to them that they should work diligently and quickly to find suspects and bring them to justice so that mr haywood may return to his normal course of business
6426246 campbell white is a business that pastor dan runs we as churchgoers are not aware of its nature
6426247 being american pastors are equipped to work as accent trainers in bangalore many such people work in churches
6426248 we have served him a written order asking him not to leave the country till his name is cleared by investigators
6426249 a case has been registered in ahmedabad and under instructions from the gujarat police a look out notice has been served at all the land sea and air exit routes to stop the husband and wife if they try to flee the country
6426250 he is definitely under our scanner as his name surfaced in a serious matter we are still looking into the matter and he has not been given a clean chit yet
6426251 having served with the us army and the police one cannot believe that he was so na ve in operating and maintaining computer security and secrecy the us cops are trained to be very careful in such matters
6426252 india does not see it as a threat but it is worrisome especially with the situation there now

6426255 for keeping a check on prices and in the interest of farmers the government has decided to extend the notification for imposition of stock limits on wheat and pulses till april 30 2009
6426256 some delegations gave approving statements but others expressed concerns expressed this morning and conditions will be tabled this afternoon
6426257 an exemption for india would have severe consequences for the non proliferation system
6426258 the problem in the state of jammu and kashmir is neither hindu versus muslim nor jammu versus the kashmir valley it is essentially nationalist versus separatist
6426259 there is indeed a great sense of anger and hurt across the country in general and in jammu and kashmir in particular as to the manner in which the upa government has surrendered before the separatists
6426260 the massive and peaceful peoples protest which is continuing in the jammu region is not only unique but unparalleled in the history of democratic movement in the country all this shows a lingering sense of injustice and discrimination that has troubled the people of jammu over the years
6426261 first it was projected that the agitation in jammu has a communal character the central government and the state administration ought to have dispelled this motivated campaign immediately but they again kept on vacillating giving further opportunity to separatist elements to continue their sinister campaign
6426262 the manner in which the upa government at the centre headed by the congress has responded to the developments in jammu and kashmir is a disturbing reminder of the manner in which the congress party has dealt with the kashmir problem right since independence
6426263 a religious war with those who are unbelievers in the mission of muhammad the prophet it is an incumbent religious duty established in the quran and in the traditions as a divine institution and enjoined especially for the purpose of advancing islam
6426264 wherever an islamic community exists it has a god given right to step forward and take control of the political authority when god restrained muslims from jihad for a certain period it was a question of strategy rather than of principle
6426265 brings out with simplicity clarity and precision the quranic philosophy on the application of the military force within the context of the totality that is jihad
6426266 in this orwellian language an aggressor is anyone who stands in the way of jihad that is to say anyone who defends himself

6426327 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill
6426328 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6426329 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard on
6426330 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6426331 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
6426332 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6426333 i know that there are some expectations to do something before the end of the year
6426334 bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach
6426335 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6426336 we looked at length of stay and unplanned readmissions and the number of people that returned to a hospital following a stay has decreased between the years 2004 and 2005
6426337 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6426338 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6426339 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6426340 this agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6426341 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6426342 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge

6426347 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6426348 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6426349 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6426350 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6426351 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6426352 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6426353 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
6426354 if mccain would work to properly fund va care there would be no issue about a va card
6426355 mccain by wanting to give vets private care is walking away from the va and ignoring the problem
6426356 for every vet who would get a va card that would be one less vet using the va
6426357 would mean in a short period of time a smaller budget fewer locations and the eventual dismantling of the best health care system in the country
6426358 the pullback has started at such a pace that by the end of august 22 all the forces of the russian federation will be behind the line of our zone of responsibility

6426372 there seems to be a belief that 3 d films are not getting their moneys worth unless they hurtle objects or body parts at the audience every time that happens it creates a fatal break in the illusion of the film the idea of a movie even an animated one is to convince us halfway at least that that were seeing on the screen is sort of really happening images leaping off the screen destroy that illusion
6426373 in real life we perceive in three dimensions yes but we do not perceive parts of our vision dislodging themselves from the rest and leaping at us
6426374 but what about rapid movement toward the viewer yes we see a car aiming for us but it advances by growing larger against its background not by detaching from it nor did we evolve to stand still and regard its advance to survive we learned instinctively to turn around leap aside run away we didnt just stand there evolving the ability to enjoy a 3 d movie
6426375 ask yourself this question have you ever watched a 2 d movie and wished it were in 3 d remember that boulder rolling behind indiana jones in raiders of the lost ark better in 3 d no it would have been worse would have been a tragedy the 3 d process is like a zombie a vampire or a 17 year cicada seemingly dead but crawling out alive after a lapse of years we need a wooden stake

6426387 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6426388 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6426389 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money
6426390 people dont tend to forget to carry around their credit card but theyll leave most of those 12 loyalty cards at home
6426391 how about combining the two and making it easier for consumers

6426456 always had the mental makeup you want in a defensive lineman
6426457 your legs have to get used to them but its more a mental than a physical thing when you put them on youve got to push through them train with them and theyll take care of you it just takes a mental commitment

6426459 sucede con frecuencia que objetivamente las masas necesitan un cambio determinado pero que subjetivamente no tienen todav a conciencia de esa necesidad y no est n dispuestas o decididas a realizarlo en tales circunstancias debemos esperar con paciencia no debemos realizar el cambio hasta que por efecto de nuestro trabajo la mayor parte de las masas haya adquirido conciencia de la necesidad de ese cambio y tenga el deseo y la decisi n de hacerlo de otro modo nos aislaremos de las masas todo trabajo que requiera la participaci n de las masas resultar ser una mera formalidad y terminar en el fracaso si las masas no est n conscientes de la necesidad de ese trabajo ni se muestran dispuestas a participar en l
6426460 la postergaci n no nos causar mucho da o sino que por el contrario puede traernos ventajas all ellos la clase dominante lama sta con sus fechor as e injusticia contra el pueblo nosotros a nuestro turno nos dedicamos a hacer cosas buenas tales como la producci n el comercio la construcci n de caminos el servicio m dico y el trabajo de frente nico uni n con la mayor a y educaci n paciente con el objeto de ganarnos a las masas

6426463 en las llanuras la gran revoluci n socialista ha sido una lucha de clases muy violenta

6426468 hacer la revoluci n no es ofrecer un banquete una revoluci n es una insurrecci n es un acto de violencia mediante el cual una clase derroca a otra sin recurrir a la m xima fuerza el campesinado jam s lograr a derrocar el poder de los terratenientes profundamente arraigado a trav s de los milenios
6426469 en algunos lugares vienen acusando una grave anormalidad las relaciones entre las nacionalidades tal situaci n es intolerable para los comunistas es indispensable criticar a fondo las ideas chovinistas de gran jan que se manifiestan de modo grave entre muchos militantes y cuadros de nuestro partido ideas reaccionarias de la clase terrateniente y la burgues a reflejadas en las relaciones entre las nacionalidades en otras palabras las ideas burguesas dominan en la mente de una parte de los camaradas y del pueblo que no ha recibido una educaci n marxista ni asimilado la pol tica del comit central sobre la cuesti n nacional
6426470 ponemos el acento en el combate al chovinismo de gran jan hay que combatir tambi n el nacionalismo local pero este por lo com n no es el blanco principal en el pasado los gobernantes reaccionarios sobre todo los de la nacionalidad jan levantaron toda clase de barreras entre las diversas nacionalidades y atropellaron a las minor as nacionales las consecuencias de todo esto no son f ciles de liquidar en corto tiempo ni siquiera dentro del pueblo trabajador el aire del espacio los bosques de la tierra y las riquezas del subsuelo son todos importantes elementos indispensables para la construcci n del socialismo pero ning n factor material puede ser explotado y aprovechado sino por el factor hombre debemos trabajar porque haya buenas relaciones entre la nacionalidad jan y las minor as nacionales y consolidar la unidad entre ellas para edificar nuestra gran patria socialista con los esfuerzos de todos

6426505 das rechenzentrum der zukunft muss vor allem eine gute energieeffizienz aufweisen durch die nutzung von servern auf der basis von gleichstrom lassen sich in rechenzentren enorme kostenersparnisse erzielen das rechenzentrum braucht weniger strom eine geringere k hlleistung und eine kleinere fl che
6426506 die gr eren rechenzentren verursachen immer h here energiekosten die f r viele unternehmen zur belastung werden allerdings ergeben sich durch den einsatz von gleichstroml sungen erhebliche einsparungspotenziale so verringern sich bei diesen l sungen die w rmeabgabe und der energieverbrauch bei komponenten auf gleichstrombasis ben tigt nicht jeder server ein eigenes netzteil stattdessen kann die stromumwandlung entweder ber einem rack erfolgen oder f r eine vielzahl von racks zentral in der n he der klimaanlage wenn dies konsequent umgesetzt wird reduzieren sich die stromkosten und die entsprechende k hlleistung um zirka 40 prozent gerade die l ftungssysteme sind wahre energiefresser ein rechenzentrum mit 256 auf gleichstrom betriebenen servern kann 60 000 euro pro jahr an energiekosten einsparen wenn es nur die zahl der l fter in den servern reduziert zus tzlich k nnen diese server r cken an r cken in die schr nke eingebaut werden dadurch entsteht ein kamineffekt der die warme luft automatisch nach oben steigen l sst es muss keine zus tzliche energie zum entl ften aufgewendet werden und keine speziellen k hlungssysteme installiert werden zudem sind die gleichstroml sungen kleiner und sparen platz in ein rack passen einfach mehr server so k nnen umz ge in gr ere r umlichkeiten vermieden werden
6426507 wir produzieren schon heute in erheblichem umfang lohndruckauftr ge f r externe kunden wir gehen davon aus dass dieser anteil deutlich steigen wird wenn die neue goss rotation voll die produktion aufgenommen hat
6426508 dies ist die erste goss druckmaschine dieser art in europa sie zeichnet sich durch eine produktionsleistung von 40 000 exemplaren pro stunde und eine vergleichsweise geringe stellfl che aus w hrend unserer marktsondierung sahen wir eine demonstration eines baldwin towerclean systems und wir waren von der einfachen bedienung der geringen wartung und der gr ndlichen gummituchreinigung sehr beeindruckt au erdem haben wir seitens goss nur positives ber das towerclean system geh rt
6426509 towerclean ist ein sehr wirtschaftliches und effektives gummituchreinigungssystem mit geringem wartungsbedarf das ausgezeichnete reinigungsergebnisse bringt
6426510 die produktivit tssteigerung ist au erordentlich beeindruckend au erdem haben wir festgestellt dass die reinigung mit baldwin towerclean gr ndlicher ist als bei manueller waschung
6426511 towerclean verbraucht rund 4 5 l waschmittel f r die reinigung der gummit cher aller f nf t rme
6426512 das baldwin system ben tigt zwischen 300 und 400 zylinderumdrehungen bis die reinigung durchgef hrt ist das papier das waschmittel absorbiert hat kann mit der normalen makulatur entsorgt werden w hrend der manuellen reinigung kamen bis zu 80 putzlappen zum einsatz die vor einer erneuten verwendung gewaschen werden mussten
6426513 ein weiterer wichtiger punkt ist dass die automatische gummituchreinigungstechnologie das maschinenpersonal von einer unangenehmen aufgabe entledigt die mitarbeiter sind mit der neuen situation wesentlich zufriedener und angesichts der wachsenden gesundheitsund sicherheitsproblematik ist die gummituchreinigung ein bereich der druckproduktion der immer st rker im blickpunkt steht
6426514 es ist noch zu fr h um definitiv schl sse ziehen zu k nnen wie schnell sich die investition bezahlt macht auf jeden fall haben wir eine menge wertvoller produktionszeit gewonnen

6426526 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a highfrequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6426527 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6426528 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6426529 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6426530 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group
6426531 we will resume the testing programme once all the necessary amendments to the safety concept have been implemented we expect this to be the case in the autumn

6426564 we are enhancing security by creating a less stressful experience this enables our officers to provide better support to the people who need it most while others are able to navigate the checkpoint more expeditiously

6426583 but its hard for me to see it you try to be a well rounded player play good defense drive in runs hit for power hit for average all those things and im proud of the fact that in each area i can help this team out but i dont consider myself among the regular guys who should be in the mvp talk
6426584 i see all the room for improvement i have i look at it and say i had 100 rbi but what about those 20 runs i should have driven in but didnt i had 100 but i could have had 120 thats the way i look at it
6426585 it should come from a team that goes to the playoffs period
6426586 last year rightfully so the top two guys were matt holliday and jimmy rollins and it was because their teams made the playoffs
6426587 obviously hes the guy that gets this offense going and hes having a big year too so theres a long way to go
6426588 no i dont think about that at all not at all
6426589 leadoff guys like me i dont hit too many home runs i dont have too much power jimmy won last year as a leadoff man but he hit 30 some home runs so you gotta do something really special to win it if youre a leadoff man

6426673 there are three key elements to potty training knowing when the child is ready to begin being consistent with the approach and being pleasantly supportive of the childs efforts
6426674 the research has revealed that parents believe they and previous generations were toilet trained quicker and earlier a key reason parents are waiting longer now is to fit in with their busy lifestyles and because the children themselves are comfortable in their super absorbent disposable nappies
6426675 almost half of those who admit to making mistakes during the training period said they were inconsistent in their approach and shouldnt have put their children back into nappies or pull ups for journeys
6426676 it is vitally important that once the training has started there are no mixed or confused messages given to the child starting and stopping training prolongs the process
6426677 we know potty training is quite an intense time for parents and children alike and this research suggests that due to our busy lives the process has become parent centric rather than child centric with parents giving out inconsistent messages and reverting to nappies away from the home to avoid any accidents
6426678 clearly it is better for everyone you the child and the environment to complete potty training as soon as possible we hope that by following elizabeths advice and perhaps having poteez on hand to use when you are out and about that potty training can be completed quickly and with a minimal amount of stress

6426790 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
6426791 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6426792 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6426793 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6426794 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6426795 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of
6426796 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and
6426797 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state
6426798 there are serious allegations in two lawsuits pending in ohio that debate the constitutionality of the denial of provisional ballots to voters the sandusky county democratic party v
6426799 moreover as you are aware advancing legislative initiatives is more challenging when you are in the minority party in congress however this challenge is multiplied when you are in the minority in the house of representatives because of house rules compared to senate rules
6426800 voting irregularities were an issue after the 2000 presidential election when democratic house initiatives relating to election reform were not considered
6426801 therefore in order to prevent our voices from being kept silent it is imperative that we object to the counting of ohios electoral votes and debate the issue of ohios voting improprieties
6426802 there are just over 1 million registered voters in cuyahoga county which of course includes the greater cleveland area and the 11th congressional district which i represent registration increased approximately 10 percent
6426803 the beauty of the 2004 election was that more people were fully prepared to exercise their right to vote however on election day hundreds and even thousands of individuals went to the voting polls and were denied the opportunity to have their vote count
6426804 in my own county where citizen volunteers put forth a herculean effort to register educate mobilize and protect the vote there were people who experienced irregularities
6426805 poor and minority communities had disproportionately long waits 4 to 5 hour waits were widespread
6426806 cuyahoga county had an overall provisional ballot rejection rate of 32 percent rejection rates for provisional ballots in african american precincts wards in cleveland ohio averaged 37 percent and ranged as high as 51 percent
6426807 thousands of partisan challengers concentrated in cuyahoga county s minority and democratic communities effectively served to intimidate voters and confuse poll workers there were both inconsistent and illegal requests for photo identification
6426808 there were problems with absentee ballots including incorrect information provided to voters by the secretary of state and consequently the cuyahoga county board of elections telling voters they could not vote in their precinct
6426809 this objection points out the inadequacy of a great election system which permits 50 secretarys of state to administer a federal election and impose so many different state laws regulating the election
6426810 in ohio the secretary of state kenneth blackwell who served as co chair of the bush re election campaign issued a bizarre series of directives in the days preceding the 2004 presidential election that created tremendous confusion among voters in cuyahoga county and across the state of ohio
6426811 for example on september 7 2004 secretary blackwell issued a directive to local boards of elections mandating rejection of voter registration forms based on their paperweight
6426812 my objection points to the need to implement across this nation standards that apply to all states we need to enact legislation that will
6426813 what happened in ohio may well have been repeated in counties across this country

6426843 calcium tastes calcium y there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6426844 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6426845 hopefully we wont have to be sitting by as somebody dies to wait to chop their tongues off were not ambulance chasers there are cases where people have cancer of the tongue and have to get them removed
6426846 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6426847 we believe that it is in the best interest of the company to utilize its strategy of selling off via bid these rights salvageable materials and timber rights as it will result in a nice windfall of cash to the company and will eliminate the cost of us having to deal with it
6426848 it is the intent to get these developments approved by local governments and underway as soon as possible as it will reduce the carrying costs to the company and will result in a greater profit margin to the overall projects

6426869 investigators are poring over the scene of spains deadliest air disaster in 25 years trying to find clues as to why a jet packed with holiday travelers caught fire during takeoff and killed 153 people the crash wednesday in madrid has drawn worldwide attention and stands in contrast to a period of unprecedented aviation safety improvements in europe the usa and other nations
6426870 the scene is devastating the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6426871 accidents on takeoff are relatively rare the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away

6426873 the savannah hilton head market is a high leisure route with very little originating business traffic and what is there has typically supported delta air lines

6426876 the airlines third largest employer with a work force of more than 300 at its reservations call center only orlando and atlanta the airlines major hub have more airtran employees
6426877 from the airports standpoint we did everything we could to support them here
6426878 we even went into the ground services business to help them cut costs but airtran was all about getting more business passengers and our market is 70 leisure travelers plus you simply cant attract business people when your first daily flight to atlanta doesnt leave until almost noon
6426879 and while i dont think were quite big enough for them yet were getting closer they have acknowledged that they dont have a presence in georgia and we know they dont want to go to atlanta so well keep pushing savannah

6426883 there is a lack of awareness on low testosterone in this country and many especially do not realize that low testosterone levels can be associated with other serious medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes and obesity

6426957 she ran towards the car which had stopped and the witness opened the rear door and took the child out of the car she shouted for the accused to stop but she continued to drive in an erratic manner
6426958 she has very little recollection of that day she realises she should not have been driving in that state and especially not with her daughter in the car
6426959 you endangered yourself and members of the public and you had your five year old child in the car exposing her to danger

6426980 if it was a category 1 2 or 3 hurricane making a direct hit on jacksonville youd have something
6426981 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its intellectual property rights
6426982 we have not been served with any lawsuit or other action by hillcrest and therefore have no comment
6426983 it could happen but the stakes would be so high that nintendo wouldnt let it happen
6426984 the reality of it is one of two things is going to happen either theres no merit to hillcrests suit and theyll lose or nintendo will settle
6426985 you can describe multiple products in your patent application and the fact that you dont describe the exact same product thats not the key
6426986 when our rivalry can unwittingly damage the business and employment prospects of indians in companies run by pakistanis and for pakistanis in companies run by british indians those who look back cannot look forward we must look forward to living in peace and harmony not only in britain but throughout the world for our own good
6426987 our roots are the same we can always live in two countries but this should not stop us from being friends
6426988 they both remain committed to working for prosperity friendly rivalry is always good but to the extent which harms is unjustifiable
6426989 our people need bread and not bombs we are wasting our meagre resources on weapons of mass destruction when we cannot even provide clean water or feed them
6426990 thailand is not allowing him to enter the country and hong kong is turning him back so there is no choice for him now
6426991 it is the responsibility of thai airways to take him out of the country
6426992 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6426993 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6426994 this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say ok well do whatever it takes to help
6426995 they came they allowed the movie to be finished and they didnt take money it goes to heaths daughter
6426996 thats extraordinary and wonderful and weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help

6427005 people who have been limited on their water supply within the city will soon not have to worry about such issues
6427006 the pipeline attaches the al rasheed water treatment plant to the water tower in mahmudiyah in order to bring potable water to the city
6427007 this is a shared project between coalition forces and the iraqi government
6427008 the local water director came to us and identified demand for water in mahmudiyah as well as excess supply in al rasheed we provided the pipe and the goi is providing the funding for the installation testing and connection of the pipe everything but the pipe itself
6427009 the government of iraq did the technical piece of the project so that it was completed to their standards and their specifications
6427010 though widely used in medical schools completem e has huge potential for streamlining nursing dental pharmacist and veterinary programs while facultytrack can provide huge benefits for any university

6427016 we are integrating land maritime air special forces operations and selected interagency organizations in a realistic and challenging training environment
6427017 panamax used to be a strictly naval operation but it truly has become a joint combined exercise because that is the way we operate
6427018 we didnt have that interagency piece ready with the department of state and department of justice and others and we all learned from that
6427019 the bottom line is that dod department of defense cant do it all it takes all instruments of national power
6427020 we recognize that we can kill anything and we can destroy armies but as experience has shown that doesnt mean that you have won
6427021 this would all be so much easier if this was just a u s only military exercise
6427022 but thats not how we want to operate we dont want it to be just the u s alone
6427023 so its our imperative to ensure that we are all able to work together
6427024 this is a combined joint operation exactly like you would see in afghanistan and iraq
6427025 once you figure out what those capabilities are youre able to tap into those assets
6427026 this gives me a better appreciation of other services and other nations capabilities as well as their limitations
6427027 these are valuable lessons we need to learn here in a training environment
6427028 in the army we say that we need to train as we fight and thats what we are doing here
6427029 because of the complexity of the multinational environment it is absolutely critical that we practice as we would operate in a real world contingency this is the place where we identify any hiccups and work out those practices
6427030 history of the vegetable drugs of the pharmacopeia of the united states
6427031 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
6427032 i dont understand how confidentiality of the donor would be an issue
6427033 this program is so important because the women obviously represent the other half of the iraqi population
6427034 there are so many unique problems that women have had even before the saddam hussein regime such as literacy health and employment issues women have suffered for so many years and they are still lagging behind through nongovernment organizations we can accomplish so much little by little
6427035 the vanguard womens initiative program started off slowly but through continuous effort and persistence the team has met many ngos that want to help the iraqi women in so many different aspects of life
6427036 we are getting close to opening womens centers in seddah jebella and jurf as sahkr
6427037 i saw so many local women attending classes and they were eager to learn everything that they could i was more shocked to see that the school had female instructors and they are very well respected

6427117 hes got a chance depending on how the summer goes of coming into camp with a legitimate chance to turn some heads at camp next year
6427118 hes still a kid but hes becoming a man hes a hockey player he can play both ends of the rink he knows the game hes competitive you saw him when he came up for a couple games last year he stepped right in and i dont think he looked out of place
6427119 it was time for him to move on to learn the pro game
6427120 hes another guy that has a lot of skill can skate good size hes got to take it to the next level and get acclimated to the next level
6427121 over the course of this summer and coming into camp next year he could be a pleasant surprise
6427122 we were happy to be able to get patrick where we did that said you always want to see how a player performs at the next level patrick was exposed to a much higher level of play in the ohl and he came through with a big season
6427123 we were happy to be able to get patrick where we did
6427124 that said you always want to see how a player performs at the next level patrick was exposed to a much higher level of play in the ohl and he came through with a big season
6427125 he has made some very encouraging strides and we have high hopes for him in the future we signed him to a contract early last season which im sure was a good boost for his confidence he could be a guy who challenges for a roster spot with the phantoms in the fall depending on how the summer progresses and he performs at training camp
6427126 just by looking at his numbers you can picture what type of player he is hes going to finish his checks all over the ice hes going to be an antagonistic guy to play against those guys are the new type of agitating guys that are playing he can get on guys he moves real well and hes hard to play against hes one of those guys you want on your bench and not on the other bench he knows what his role is and he likes doing it our guys are extremely excited about him you noticed him when hes on the ice
6427127 whats most impressive about kevin is his level of maturity on and off the ice
6427128 he handles himself extremely well and is a born leader hes the guy that everyone on his team looks up to even at age 18 he has that presence about him and hes just all business
6427129 hes a well rounded two way defenseman good head good stick got some offense to his game
6427130 lehtivuori isnt a big guy and hes not going to suddenly develop into a huge physical presence or anything
6427131 but we like what he brings to the table in the skill department he is very talented with the puck and brings that skating element that is becoming so important to develop for your defense
6427132 hes still growing and that will take some more time as he continues to get stronger though joonas will gain a better understanding of the things he does best he already has a good idea because hes a very smart player
6427133 he moves good competitive smart good stick there arent a lot of weaknesses in his game hes going to be a good player and hes getting better as time goes on
6427134 this was his first season in north america playing at the major junior level and we like what weve seen so far
6427135 its not easy to make that transition from the european rinks but he did a fine job he made some good strides and also handled that midseason trade very well that says a lot about his character

6427259 ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6427260 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6427261 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6427262 within the context of the school there is almost no issue to do with gangs because we try and create the hackney free community
6427263 clearly there are a lot of issues going on locally and nationally but they hardly impact on the school at all
6427264 but suddenly we have had this dreadful tragedy possibly as a result of gang activity
6427265 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives
6427266 apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6427267 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6427268 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6427269 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6427270 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6427271 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6427272 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the victim fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police
6427273 to my dearest cousin ahmed you will always be in my thoughts love you loads with sympathy
6427274 rip may you have a good life in your next future miss you loads
6427275 eviction is a last resort however dyson had been given a number of chances to change his behaviour which he failed to do
6427276 as a tenant dyson has a duty to be a responsible neighbour whcih includes making sure people who visit his home do not act anti socially towards other residents
6427277 this is an example of how the community has pulled together to do something about a noisy neighbour who was affecting their quality of life
6427278 we will do everything we can to put a stop to behaviour which causes misery to neighbours
6427279 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think well have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
6427280 maam let me say that i dont disagree with anything you said

6427291 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics and personal ambition
6427292 i have not suggested it because i believe he genuinely wants to serve americas national interests now it is time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain

6427316 the first step towards building an alternative world has to be a refusal of the world picture implanted in our minds and all the false promises used everywhere to justify and idealise the delinquent and insatiable need to sell another space is vitally necessary
6427317 hope however is an act of faith and has to be sustained by other concrete actions for example the action of approach of measuring distances and walking towards this will lead to collaborations which deny discontinuity the act of resistance means not only refusing to accept the absurdity of the world picture offered to us but denouncing it and when hell is denounced from within it ceases to be hell
6427318 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues

6427342 its devastating of course to miss dave rogers and jason ratcliff at the race track but weve got to go on and weve got to live without them
6427343 joe gibbs racing is a tough enough organization that has got a lot of depth where we can do that were going to work to try to make sure we come out here with the best race cars
6427344 theyre still going to be at the shop putting together some race cars and doing all the work that they need to do to keep the stuff up to par were just going to have different guys here at the race track to crew chief during the race theres plenty of guys who have been on set up plates that know how to change slugs know how to change springs that know how to do all of that stuff during practice
6427345 i dont think youre going to see much change out of the nationwide effort
6427346 ive requested that cup crew chief steve addington come over and kind of be a consultant hell be there a little bit during practice and to make race calls on top of the box
6427347 while the circumstances are far from ideal im looking forward to bristol and getting to work with joey logano in this weekends nationwide series race
6427348 ive had the pleasure of working with joey throughout the past couple of years on the jgr sprint cup test team and ive obviously been impressed with his natural talent and ability to give excellent feedback on the handling of his race car
6427349 its a really unfortunate situation but we are going to work hard in order to run up front and be in contention to win like this team has all year long
6427350 its been a while since ive been in the crew chief role but i really look forward to working with kyle busch this weekend at bristol
6427351 any crew chief would jump at the opportunity to work with a driver as talented as kyle and im no different my goal is to work with everyone at jgr to continue our successful nationwide series season
6427352 you can go from the bottom to the top of the track and with the old surface you just couldnt do that
6427353 if you got hung on the outside you were stuck and if you tried to force your way back into line thats when trouble would typically start i dont know what its like to watch but from where i sit racing at bristol is pretty fun now
6427354 you can run all over the race track which is whats so fun about it you can race guys arent running over each other to pass each other
6427355 the new surface provides a little bit more exciting opportunities to pass whether its a restart or a long tire run
6427356 you can get up into the outside groove or go in high and come across the middle and go low easier you can change your line around and then of course the new car hereditarily is tight
6427357 so its very difficult to get the car to turn but you struggle with that all the time you have to adjust and change your line and with the five wins i have had there it has been different every time whether it was flat out speed or a little bit of strategy every time you have to adjust to the changing circumstances
6427358 since bristol has been repaved the racing is not the same but they did a nice job of redoing it
6427359 for the fans i know its not the racing that theyre used to but for the drivers the new track is a lot of fun to drive
6427360 its stressful when you are racing for points it makes it tough
6427361 on the other hand its a lot of fun its very physical and very competitive it is an emotionally draining race as well as being physically draining add comment
6427362 there have continued to be some absolutely brilliant performances by team gb athletes
6427363 it has been another outstanding day and a great gold medal on the track by christine who ran a fantastic race
6427364 this proves everyone wrong in all the things they have been saying about her it has been a very difficult few years for her and for the whole family
6427365 she has proved herself to the whole world she proved herself at the world championships and now she has done it at the olympics i am so proud of her
6427366 if we have to find more money for a particular aspect of the programme then savings will have to be effected elsewhere and everybody involved in the programme understands that
6427367 its the most unbelievable feeling you cross the line and all the pressure and expectation evaporates and its like nothing else youve ever felt
6427368 thats why the emotions come out at the end it just erupts out of you
6427369 its not bad for a wee boy who got his first bmx bike in a jumble sale at the age of seven
6427370 i think weve all been joyously watching the olympics to win at cycling sailing and now on the track today and yet another set of great gold medals today
6427371 either youre mad at someone or someone else is mad at you a lot of the time youll see a couple of guys beating on each other in front of you and you just know that theyre having a little disagreement its all part of racing at bristol
6427372 the best thing you can do at bristol is control youre temper
6427373 of course thats easier said than done theres just not much room to pass so a lot of the time you might have to bump a guy a little to nudge him out of the way youre rubbing up against people almost every lap and theyre doing the same to you
6427374 i saw an ad on television the other day for the race
6427375 its the one where the guy takes a bunch of die cast cars and throws them into a dryer thats what racing at bristol is like youve got 43 cars on a small track going really fast its a recipe for disaster or fun depending on which way you look at it
6427376 these figures should act as a wake up call to anyone employing it professionals
6427377 people management has not been an area of focus for many in the industry but the possibility of unhappy employees willing to leave their employer at the drop of a hat should help to highlight the issue
6427378 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6427379 i am really looking forward to my first nationwide race
6427380 ive never raced at bristol so my main goal is to go out and just qualify first and foremost once in the race i plan to be patient race smart and capitalize on my short track racing experience

6427385 maybe i envisioned myself being a cup driver four years ago
6427386 but twists of fate and sometimes you dont make your own roads you just make them as smooth as you can i had an opportunity to go work at robert yates and got an opportunity to have an exposure to a lot of different people and it kept you learning at a very fast pace
6427387 as far as what hes going through and his adjustments hes obviously a top caliber driver from the irl side but theres some different things to learn and theres different ways cup guys go racing
6427388 hes certainly done a great job of getting up to speed with that hopefully i can help carry that along with at least a sense of understanding what his job entails
6427389 obviously we need time to build our team together and having the opportunity to get started with them this season
6427390 this is a decision the company wanted to make its better to do it now and give us all a chance to work together so we an focus better on what we need to do next year to get ourselves in a position where were not worried about the top 35 and where were racing for top 15s and top 10s
6427391 there will be a little bit of a learning curve between us
6427392 i am excited about the opportunity to work with him because he is open minded he is willing to listen and hes got some good intensity about making the car go fast and thats fun to work with
6427393 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can

6427467 we proberen de oorzaak nog te achterhalen het probleem leeft vooral in arendonk balen geel hoogstraten en ravels we vonden 477 adressen terug die hun herinnering nog niet hebben betaald en mogelijk de brieven nog niet hebben ontvangen we sturen hen een tweede herinnering maar annuleren de administratieve kosten twee weken lang ledigen we alsnog de containers die geblokkeerd werden wegens ontoereikend saldo
6427468 de hoge brandstofprijzen in combinatie met technologische doorbraken en dalende kosten zullen in het voordeel van hernieuwbare energiebronnen spelen
6427469 de investeringen in hernieuwbare energie stegen in 2006 met 43 procent tegenover 2005
6427470 hoewel de omstandigheden er goed zijn hadden ze het gevoel op een enorme voorraad olie en gas te zitten die nooit zou opraken ze gingen dan ook niet op zoek naar alternatieven
6427471 bij de acht resterende containers plaatsten we glasbollen zo beperken we de hinder voor de antwerpenaars

6427477 reincarnating the lines of europe and russias spheres of influence
6427478 no legal or moral argument to obstruct a peacekeeping force on georgian ground georgia is a sovereign state
6427479 the violation of the territorial integrity of a sovereign state and the destabilisation of democratic governments must not become the hallmark of a russian foreign policy aiming at restoring the former soviet union
6427480 more favourable treatment of russia over georgia and other states
6427481 ideally the priorities should have been set the other way round therefore it is now even more important that the eu soon concludes a free trade agreement with georgia to give its citizens a perspective
6427482 how could saakashvili be so incredibly stupid to walk straight into the trap set for him by mr putin
6427483 the russian response was certainly out of scale but it appears to be overlooked that the initial attack was ordered by georgias president saakashvili
6427484 russias action in georgia unacceptable eu must not proceed with business as usual
6427485 ze zijn tijdens de ruzie nog van bestuurder gewisseld en die heeft vervolgens de verkeersregelaar moedwillig aangereden
6427486 it is surprising that after all these years of accession negotiations bucharest did not understand that what the european commission needs is not public relations but results in the fight against corruption and now more than ever before

6427493 a fair return for the public on research funded with taxpayers money
6427494 peer reviewed journals play an irreplaceable role in authenticating articles through registration certification dissemination and editorial improvement
6427495 for our member publishers making access to research articles free at any point after or even upon publication presupposes a means of recovering revenues that allow the journal to exist
6427496 the embargo periods foreseen in the context of the commissions open access pilot six to 12 months after initial publication provide a safeguard for the investment made by scientific publishers
6427497 this approach assumes that an article has little value after its embargo period for the vast majority of journals this is a dangerous and fallacious assumption

6427507 im not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer
6427508 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
6427509 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
6427510 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
6427511 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers

6427574 in addition increases in the frequency of spanking are associated with increased odds of abuse and mothers who report spanking on the buttocks with an object such as a belt or a switch are nine times more likely to report abuse compared to mothers who report no spanking with an object
6427575 this study demonstrated for the first time that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
6427576 striking a child with an object is unacceptable and may be dangerous
6427577 depuis mercredi nous recevons de nombreux soutiens de m decins mais galement de la population les patients sinsurgent galement car ils ne trouvent pas normal de mettre les soins m dicaux en p ril cause de conflits administratifs

6427588 like saddam was slyly taking credit for something hed never been able to take credit for

6427590 we cannot come all the way to you in the united states but individual arabs may reach you
6427591 their appointment is in the morning and indeed the morning is near
6427592 we do know that nichols bombs did not work before his philippine stay
6427593 i just believe the clintons did everything in their power to hide the fact that saddam was waging a terrorist war against us for eight years
6427594 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6427595 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6427596 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6427597 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6427598 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6427599 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
6427600 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
6427601 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
6427602 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
6427603 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
6427604 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
6427605 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
6427606 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
6427607 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
6427608 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
6427609 the more we understand the better we can treat it and the better for everyone
6427610 queremos as melhores id ias para criar projetos em pequena e grande escala que beneficiem os nova iorquinos

6427622 our larger surveillance installations often require wireless because burying cable is impractical or cost prohibitive qorvus was strongly recommended to us by another mainland cctv integrator and i have been really impressed with the cost savings ease of installation wireless range and amazing performance weve been able to offer our customers using the qorvus technology
6427623 when youve done as many large scale cctv installations as we have you really value things like long term reliability responsive real time technical support and especially the wireless bandwidth to handle all those video streams without drop outs qorvus gives us all of that and much more
6427624 weve been exceptionally pleased with keener technologies and qorvus systems performance as vendors and definitely look forward to a continued relationship at our existing ports and at our planned new service locations
6427625 we couldnt be happier with the fantastic professional job that keener technologies has been doing in bringing our industrial cctv and wireless networking technologies to the hawaiian islands we always enjoy new challenges and ive been delighted with the results especially given the hostile industrial marine environment we faced at the ports of honolulu and maui

6427627 a mammoth network of spaghetti like gas filaments around a black hole
6427628 as the black hole sucks in gas from its surroundings it powers jets of matter that produce bubbles of energetic particles in the surrounding cluster gas as these bubbles grow and rise cooled gas from ngc 1275s core gets drawn into long tendrils in their wake like the strings that trail behind balloons

6427632 at the moment i am speaking to you i have never been so aware of what the solitude of a head of state could be in the face of the decisions he has to take
6427633 i want to ensure your colleagues are never in such a situation i want all the lessons to be drawn from what happened
6427634 drawing the consequences in terms of equipment on the military escorting of our operations and of the missions that are conducted in afghanistan
6427635 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy so people are very shocked and upset
6427636 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved 9 gcses
6427637 ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6427638 family members came in and found out about his results but not his parents because they were too upset
6427639 the family is shocked and devastated his tutor said to me he never would have expected ahmed to be involved in this sort of incident
6427640 within the context of the school there is almost no issue to do with gangs because we try and create the hackney free community
6427641 clearly there are a lot of issues going on locally and nationally but they hardly impact on the school at all
6427642 but suddenly we have had this dreadful tragedy possibly as a result of gang activity
6427643 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives
6427644 apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6427645 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6427646 this caused the victim and his friends to leave the area the victim was separated from his friends
6427647 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors trying to escape
6427648 he reached the seventh floor when he could no longer carry on after this point he fell to his death
6427649 the other group involved are described as black male youths some were wearing hooded tops others were wearing bandanas and were riding pedal cycles
6427650 i am appealing to anyone who witnessed the victim fall from the tower block and anyone who witnessed events prior to him fall to please contact police
6427651 you dont want it to end this way but its all we could do
6427652 a prova foi boa a chuva diminuiu o ritmo das equipes mas a gente andou bem

6427654 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6427655 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6427656 then i went to grab it and there was nothing
6427657 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6427658 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care

6427663 we have a great tradition of sprinters and we wanted to show what we could do here
6427664 the start was bad and the end wasnt that great either but im grateful for the silver
6427665 todos os times a partir de agora v o querer derrotar o gr mio do contr rio eles n o v o parar de se distanciar
6427666 many of our design customers are rendering product images and want to see things move and operate

6427870 but he doesnt try to pass himself off as anything but the chocolate peddler that he is i dont think any hearts have ever been broken by the easter bunny
6427871 julie i havent stopped thinking about you all day you crawled into my head last night and all ive thought about is how to get a repeat performance

6427878 naturally it is disappointing that elphinstone and west barns are earmarked for closure
6427879 i hope we can now focus on a meaningful six week consultation period and ensure that everyone is fully informed regarding how services will continue to be delivered in east lothian
6427880 this is a case where profit has proved to be king and the needs of the local population have been cynically and arrogantly ignored
6427881 ms moffat has blindly supported prime minister gordon browns government not thinking about the consequences of the continued erosion of our public services
6427882 reducing the hours of these post offices tantamount to closure will cause great difficulty to those who rely on the services available at branches particularly the elderly and disabled
6427883 this wholesale downgrading of the rural post office network in east lothian will come as a body blow to the communities affected
6427884 i am extremely unhappy with the way this entire process has been conducted
6427885 the community council will be carrying out a consultation with the villagers to gauge their reaction to the loss of their postal service before deciding on our next step
6427886 its a concern to ourselves that theres a fairly limited service available in elphinstone and our primary worry is that this may well have an adverse effect on the shop facilities housed in the same building as the post office that are currently in place
6427887 there has been quite a response i dont think anybody wants it to close as it means quite a lot to the village
6427888 theres a lot of people who rely on the post office and find it difficult to get to dunbar the nearest postal facilities to the village
6427889 i think its very regrettable that we are going to lose this service and im not happy about it but i think we have to face the reality of the situation
6427890 obviously we are disappointed at the news as the post office is a part of the village even though its not a particularly commercial aspect
6427891 however as long as we can still access a post office in gifford we feel that it will not really be a great inconvenience for a lot of people as gifford is quite accessible for garvald residents
6427892 i think that the general reaction is one of relief that the proposals are not nearly as bad as we had feared
6427893 i and gifford community council again takes the opportunity to urge our people to use the services of the businesses in the village to ensure their continuation in other words use it or lose it
6427894 we are going to consult with community councils and local people about these proposals with a view to putting forward positive alternative plans to the post office for the retention of viable services in the affected areas
6427895 taking the decision to close any post office branch is always very difficult and we know will cause concern to many of our customers
6427896 we want to ensure that everyone who uses relies on or has any concern with post office services is both fully aware of the proposed changes and able to give views on them

6427902 these offences have had a devastating impact on both victims
6427903 they were placed in foster care because of neglect and mistreatment at a very young age only to find that they were even less safe in their new home
6427904 after extensive social work intervention it was decided to place the children into permanent care away from their family
6427905 during their time in foster care they had little by way of toys or personal possessions were noted to be poorly clothed and were regularly placed in a box room as punishment
6427906 over the years their behaviour deteriorated both at home and at school but this was put down to their difficulties from early childhood rather than any current issues
6427907 both victims tried to block out the abuse by the accused and although they were both aware of what was happening to the other they did not discuss it
6427908 as the abuse of both commenced when they were very young the accused taught them what to do and they did not realise that this was not normal behaviour until they were much older
6427909 they had no one whom they could tell about the abuse as they knew no adults who they could trust both feared what would happen if they told anyone and were scared of the accused
6427910 both described feeling relieved that someone now knew about what had happened to them and believed them
6427911 these are serious matters that you have pled guilty to
6427912 i think we have underestimated the anger in moscow over the increasing nato involvement in russias backyard
6427913 were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital
6427914 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6427915 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6427916 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6427917 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6427918 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6427919 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6427920 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6427921 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6427922 we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6427923 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6427924 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6427925 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6427926 and as we said from the begininng there is no hidden agenda here
6427927 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6427928 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6427954 in the end president pervez musharraf went if not quietly with remarkably little strife
6427955 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
6427956 endeavoring to cause prospective defendants to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony
6427957 there is a cloud over the vice president and that cloud remains because the defendant libby obstructed justice
6427958 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed

6427962 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties
6427963 president bush underwrote mr musharrafs dictatorship but it said nothing of the example bush himself has set in such matters including rigging elections as musharraf did

6427989 bj has had trouble pasting into the reply box therefore evolution must be a myth
6427990 sunderland formally and in detail interviewed five leading fossil experts from the worlds major fossil museums face to face in a formal scientific discussion they not only confirm but also enhance what creation scientists such as dr duane gish have been saying all along for an example see panel sunderland relentlessly takes the reader on an excursion with the experts to every single major transition the net result is devastating australian anti creationist palaeontologist michael archer is still insisting that evolutionary transition is adequately documented in the fossils the best of the best in the evolutionary fossil camp claim otherwise in their own words
6427991 none of the five museum officials whom luther sunderland interviewed could offer a single example of a transitional series of fossilized organisms that would document the transformation of one basically different type to another dr eldredge curator of invertebrate palaeontology at the american museum said that the categories of families and above could not be connected while dr raup curator of geology at the field museum of natural history in chicago said that a dozen or so large groups could not be connected with each other but dr patterson a senior palaeontologist and editor of a prestigious journal at the british museum of natural history spoke most freely about the absence of transitional forms

6428060 this is a great step forward for triathlon and it is exciting for triathlon to be moving in this direction
6428061 for us the athletes this is phenomenal the benefit of live tv is it creates a proper season people will know when to watch and when to tune into triathlon
6428062 it is similar to fi racing where the top athletes are battling head to head using the hamburg world cup model is ideal as having 100 000 spectators and tv makes it easier for us to market ourselves and as it snowballs the top athletes will want to come
6428063 this new series will provide our athletes with a stage to showcase triathlon to the world
6428064 with the success of the beijing olympic triathlon we feel there is no better time to announce our future direction no one has done this in our sport before and we are proud to be leading triathlon into a new era

6428066 nortels r amp d and incubation teams are focused on creating revolutionary communications experiences to improve the way businesses interact with their employees partners and customers and web alive will be one very tangible example of that focus
6428067 people are no longer satisfied with existing collaboration tools or with static web sites supported only by a telephone contact center as the main point of interaction they want to discuss potential purchases with others exchange ideas make business proposals and fluidly interact with others in real time
6428068 additionally web alive will offer security not available with other virtual environments today because it is integrated with corporate enterprise systems and software
6428069 if that is true then the peaceful decade of the 1990s the talk of the end of history and the triumph of liberal ideals may be written off as the good old days

6428080 these people were my friends and co workers and we were sort of united in this quest for cool stuff
6428081 the marketing department had never played a video game marketing thought the programmers were lazy the programmers thought marketing was stupid we didnt like them they didnt like us
6428082 warner put a lot of money into the company which certainly helped pay for marketing and manufacturing the games and computers

6428085 one of our main challenges is locating the right person in our organisation to answer a customer query in a timely manner and then being able to contact them directly
6428086 this was underlined by a recent report that showed 20 percent of our contact centre agents time was spent looking for the right person in our organization to handle specific customer queries what we needed was a technology solution that would leverage our prior investment in a company wide videoconferencing system with new capability to unify voice video and customer information and provide personalised customer contact with improved customer service
6428087 nortel impressed us with the direct software integration between its communication network and microsofts office communications server software providing specific information about each of our expert resources available in real time to all of our branches
6428088 this gives us an incredibly powerful platform for connecting our people with our customers in a variety of different ways through audio video text and im and ensures that regardless of where our customers are located we have the resources available to serve them
6428089 were already looking past the initial implementation to the next phase of the project which will extend the reach of our video enabled unified communications services to our customers through the web
6428090 this will give customers direct access to our consultants through the video conferencing system presenting them with a new way of communicating directly with our staff without having to leave their homes
6428091 nortel and microsofts alliance gives them a clear time to market advantage thats well ahead of what any of their competitors could muster
6428092 it was also obvious that we were speaking the same language when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint through energy efficient technology and cutting back on unnecessary travel and it was also an easy sell to my cfo the operational savings weve calculated as a result of implementing this technology are substantial delivering significant customer service enhancement more efficiently will have lasting benefits on both our top and bottom line
6428093 nortels solution is helping necu overcome the challenges of one to one communication in an organisation that is spread across multiple branches some in remote rural areas
6428094 this unified communications approach will help necu stand out from the crowd as people look for different ways of collaborating with each other and their service organisations using multiple web enabled devices in todays era of hyperconnectivity when anything that can be connected to the network is being connected
6428095 a key goal of nortel has always been to use technology to replicate the richness of a real world communications experience
6428096 the acquisition of diamondware strengthens nortels position in the converging telecommunications and it landscapes and gives us another building block to create the ultimate communications experience for our customers
6428097 diamondwares 3d voice technology will help give nortels customers a more natural and immersive communication experience whether theyre using it for traditional telephony and conferencing applications mobile unified communications or for web 2 0 virtual world environments
6428098 having had first hand exposure to both diamondware and web alive nortels web 2 0 virtual conferencing platform the natural synergies are clear
6428099 these are complex technologies that diamondware has been quietly mastering and will help nortel establish market leadership in what i see being the next wave of interactive communications

6428122 many middle income families in bristol who already are struggling with record high gasoline prices and rising electricity costs will be facing real financial hardship because of sharp increases in the cost of home heating oil said fitzgerald who attended the news conference on tuesday
6428123 im hoping aid for the neediest among us as well as for middle income families will be approved on friday
6428124 the proposals that were unveiled by house republican leader larry cafero and senate republican leader john mckinney at tuesdays news conference were offered in a bipartisan spirit and are intended to make the heating cost proposals that will be considered friday more comprehensive and compassionate
6428125 many middle class families whose incomes make them ineligible for current state and federal heating assistance programs will be hard pressed to find the extra money needed to keep their families warm this winter without some help from the state
6428126 small businesses which provide most of the jobs in the greater bristol area and elsewhere in the state also are having trouble staying afloat in todays economy substantially higher energy prices are increasing the cost of doing business in connecticut and forcing consumers to cut back on their spending small business owners are increasingly being forced to make some difficult choices in order to survive including layoffs and hiring freezes the republican proposal to increase the electricity sales tax exemption for businesses would give them badly needed breathing room and help preserve jobs
6428127 bristol residents and families throughout the state will be best served if the state legislature acts in a bipartisan manner and votes on all of the proposals that will be offered during the special session based on their merits not on who proposes them
6428128 if these proposals are not adopted during fridays special session i will make enacting them one of my top priorities for the 2009 legislative session if the people of the 77th district elect me to be their voice at the state capitol in hartford

6428202 it would be an extreme taxing of the resources that we have here locally

6428206 ready to tax ready to spend not ready to lead
6428207 we have a once in a generation chance to bring meaningful and lasting change to our country by electing barack obama president and sending a stronger democratic majority to the senate
6428208 we have a candidate who might not be a candidate

6428210 she talked very passionately about her reasons why she is in public service
6428211 and she said anyone out there who thinks they are doing me a favor by voting for mccain is not doing me a favor she said she and bill clinton are working very hard for obama and following the convention they are going to be working even harder

6428214 i know there has also been some talk about former vice president al gore
6428215 im just hoping obama doesnt pick evan bayh because he is more of an unknown
6428216 there is going to be a lot of emphasis at this convention about reaching out to the needs of our younger constituents and getting them engaged in the process
6428217 for me it is really about the difference between a contemporary modern leader with obama and his platform of hope inspiration and change compared to john mccain who will be more of the same
6428218 sarasota county is on the map for being one of the counties that can go from a red county to a blue county

6428238 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak
6428239 all else equal people would think that in a stable commodity market and a negative financial market people have more faith in the commodity place
6428240 if the dollar does fall off a lot of these guys foreign investors are able to consume more and buy more on a pure dollar per dollar basis
6428241 running back to gold running back to oil so it seems we are seeing some of the running back to safe haven

6428244 the reason why gas supplies are so tight is because refineries are not making any demand is not there

6428297 bovendien is sp fractievoorzitter remine alberts niet gevraagd om een weekje op de winkel te passen terwijl zij wel het recht daartoe heeft
6428298 met alle respect voor eric van der burg kennelijk vindt het college dat
6428299 bovendien liet de sper weten dat het langstzittende raadslid sp fractievoorzitter remine alberts gepasseerd is
6428300 en ik geloof inderdaad ook dat het belangrijkste nieuws vorige week was dat het college er niet was
6428301 als jullie nu meestemmen met onze motie x stemmen wij met jullie mee met motie y ook al staan beiden niet achter de moties de ze steunen kies in gewoon die klub die me in de tk het meest aanspreekt zoals 99 van de stemmer dat doen
6428302 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6428303 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6428304 i have a 25 year pro life record thats my commitment to you
6428305 for me the goal right now should be and this is where we can find common ground
6428306 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6428307 for those of us in the pro life community this is a great struggle ive come down on the side of stem cell research but im wildly optimistic that skin cell research will make this debate an academic one

6428311 mensen mogen best kritiek op mij of op mijn partij hebben en daar wil ik ook graag op ingaan waar ik geen zin in heb is reageren op kritiek van iemand die zich niet bekend wil maken terwijl ik gewoon open en bloot laat zien wie ik ben
6428312 binnenkort in dit theater waarschijnlijk dus ook gezever over mij
6428313 inmiddels weet ik wie zij is daarom heb ik haar reactie ook geplaatst
6428314 mensen mogen best kritiek op mij of op mijn partij hebben en daar wil ik ook graag op ingaan waar ik geen zin in heb is reageren op kritiek van iemand die zich niet bekend wil maken terwijl ik gewoon open en bloot laat zien wie ik ben
6428315 nou ben ik er niet het type naar om helemaal niet te reageren maar ik laat me niet dicteren
6428316 als je iemand als anja meulenbelt afbeeldt als alcoholist kijk zelf maar
6428317 het is een zeer belangrijk grondrecht voor onze democratie ook het kritische tegengeluid moet te horen zijn ook onwelgevallige zaken moeten aan de kaak kunnen worden gesteld en ook met satire moet een hoop kunnen worden gezegd of uitgebeeld discussie scherpt de mening
6428318 dat laatste is nog altijd een stok om ons mee te slaan
6428319 wat ik niet op prijs stel is grof en discriminerend taalgebruik
6428320 ik heb haar geprobeerd de ruimte te geven maar ze misbruikt die
6428321 voor mij bewijst het dat sonja een onsmakelijk type is dat tot alles in staat is om de door haar verafschuwde sp af te branden
6428322 achteraf gezien had ik mijn woorden bovenstaand blog wat zorgvuldiger moeten kiezen maar ik haal niets weg het geeft weer hoe ik me toen voelde benieuwd wat ze hier weer van bakt ik lach me een ongeluk

6428327 er staan heel wat zeer critische uitspraken gericht tot sonja en anderen die haar mening soms vaak delen

6428340 de uitspraak heeft naar de inschatting van de gemeente geen gevolgen voor de be indiging en terugvordering van de bijstandsuitkeringen

6428348 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6428349 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6428350 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6428351 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6428352 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6428353 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6428354 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6428355 he will be holding talks with senior officials from chinasinternational oil companies
6428356 they will speak about improving cooperation in the energysector chinese help for iran in improving oilfield recoveryrates the sale of liquefied natural gas lng to china andchinas presence in the south pars gas field

6428358 there is strong interest for sammys services at this stage we are considering our options and obviously we are looking at getting him a deal that will make him happy
6428359 santos has shown interest in getting the player down to cape town
6428360 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6428361 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6428362 i cannot reveal the name of the company but our negotiations with the potential sponsor are now at an advanced stage
6428363 we have already drafted the fixtures and will be releasing it to the media soon
6428364 the new devices which have an improved thermal resistance are offered alongside our established lower current rated devices as a higher performance option
6428365 the increased current rating allows for the design of more compact systems where an operational current rating would have required a larger package device to have been used thereby reducing material usage weight and system cost
6428366 our hope now lies on commercial houses if they fail our other hope is the slfa president nahim khadi who is expected back in the country from england this weekend
6428367 i think he would be aborting his own campaign because that is such a critical issue to so many republican voters and the republican brand is already in trouble
6428368 if he doesnt change the platform then hes being the same kind of hypocrite that he accused bush of being in 2000
6428369 mega is acting as a facilitator of the project as part of our mandate to attract new investment into the province
6428370 we are still in the process of finding suitable investors to start the project
6428371 the facility will probably be built to international standards and will be able to host national and international meetings like the one in durban
6428372 not about ego self aggrandizement getting their names in the press but our focus on whats best for the american people i think people will see that im not afraid to have folks around me who complement my strengths and who are independent
6428373 or a surprise whose name has not been circulating on the pundits short lists
6428374 heading into their conventions neck and neck in the presidential race with voters focused overwhelmingly on economic issues but convinced that the candidates are not paying enough attention to their priorities
6428375 missouri has sided with the winner in every presidential election over the past century with the exception of 1956 in the past five elections the republican candidate won an average of 46 5 percent of the vote and the democratic candidate won 46 1 percent making missouri the closest state during that time period
6428376 the tax policy center a research group run by the brookings institution and the urban institute has done the most detailed analysis of the obama and mccain tax plans and it has published a series of fascinating tables
6428377 for the bottom 80 percent of the population those households making 118 000 or less mccains various tax cuts would mean a net savings of about 200 a year on average obamas proposals would bring 900 a year in savings
6428378 weve got to have somebody whos going to think of the interests of the constituency instead of the interests of the party
6428379 i will use whatever i need to protect the interests of my state my country and the military
6428380 i hope everybody regardless of party admires this man he is a model of what we expect and want of a public official
6428381 i think that character is always an issue in any campaign
6428382 have a press conference like this one and answer your questions
6428383 what is the purpose of that because i cleared up the situation that was a year ago and its been all cleared up so why is she so hung up on the 2004 and 2006 elections
6428384 if i had changed jobs midstream meaning if i was a real estate agent and then i became a college professor i think that would be a valid argument
6428385 i was elected as a college professor thats what i do
6428386 you want to gain knowledge from a person whos been there and done it my qualifications i think stack up pretty well there
6428387 the bottom line is the numbers have never added up
6428388 at a minimum youd have to have some kind of a massive tax increase
6428389 i dont think you can forecast the amount of replacement revenue that will be required

6428394 international business is growing we expect the share of international operations to be bigger as we see a decline in fixed line business activity
6428395 our biggest challenges are in our fixed line activities we do see a downward trend
6428396 fixed line is no longer about making phone calls its about offering additional value to customers
6428397 there are still some major hurdles to be resolved before investing in a network like that we need to know what terms thered be to opening up the network to competitors we also have to know how we can realize cost savings out of these investments
6428398 the tm506 not only signifies sony ericssons expanding u s portfolio of handsets but more importantly that we have forged a strong and promising relationship with t mobile
6428399 with the launch of the tm506 with t mobile sony ericsson is positioned to offer more choice of mobile handsets for a broader range of u s consumer segments at a variety of price points
6428400 t mobile continues its 3g network deployment across the country and were pleased to leverage sony ericssons 3g handset experience to help deliver the benefits of our next generation network to our customers
6428401 the sony ericsson tm506 is a compelling feature rich phone with a vibrant display that our customers will enjoy using to connect with the important people in their lives
6428402 he saw them when they were arguing and pushing and shoving
6428403 he didnt see the guy shoot him what he did see was the guy fall
6428404 he shot the guy in the chest and casually walked away as if nothing had happened
6428405 you cant make outgoing phone calls but they can receive incoming phone calls
6428406 she said dad this is the kind of stuff that makes you scared to go to school
6428407 our kids should be able to go to school and get an education without worrying about violence in the school
6428408 there has to be more education with the parents theres a lack of discipline from what im seeing theres a lack of discipline in the homes
6428409 back in the day if i got in trouble at school i was going to get in trouble at school and i was going to get in trouble at home
6428410 she said dad this is the kind of stuff that makes you scared to go to school
6428411 to all the people in california and new york who sent money so we in washington can more easily kill ourselves i think we have to say thanks but no thanks
6428412 we believe physician assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the role of physicians as healers
6428413 patients put their trust in physicians and that bond of trust would be irrevocably harmed by the provisions of this dangerous initiative
6428414 i am free to play again and thanks to the support given to me by the club especially the ceo larry brookstone and the entire management
6428415 the person that amazed me most with his support is the coach miguel gamondi being a new coach at our club it would have been easy for him to ignore me and carry on with the rest of his players but he stood by me encouraging me all the way
6428416 i feel very lucky and honoured to be a member of the platinum stars family and all i want is to play football again fight hard for my place and payback the team with a trophy performance every time i take the field when i get a chance
6428417 estou muito feliz e particularmente excitado com a exibi o portuguesa movimentamos muito bem a bola e conseguimos criar muitas oportunidades
6428418 esta equipe foi importante para a sele o porque permitiu fazer um bom jogo treino e conhecer os jogadores al m de saber do qu eles precisam estamos em condi es para a pr xima fase do trabalho
6428419 im not so sure the governor would be happy waiting that long
6428420 we believe the standards will be an enormous jump start when you have ambitious goals
6428421 but those numbers are not the kind of numbers that are going to bring exciting industry to florida
6428422 let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism
6428423 i am questioning his judgment i am questioning his judgment senator obama has made it clear that he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6428424 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone that is going to make us want to stay home
6428425 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities
6428426 i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6428427 ill wake up every day in that white house thinking about those people in martinsville
6428428 for their leadership role on their campuses it just seems like they didnt do enough homework to look at the science on this
6428429 im an alumnus of dickinson college and cant believe they signed on to this initiative
6428430 they are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it very disappointing
6428431 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
6428432 if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might
6428433 its a very serious problem on college campuses and it just seems to get worse and worse
6428434 if theyre over there in iraq and have been shot at they may as well be able to have a beer when they get back home
6428435 the political popularity of federal highway money far outweighs the popularity of letting 18 year olds drink
6428436 in college youre free for the first time ever there are no rules
6428437 in high school there are rules and maybe its better to start drinking when there are rules
6428438 a lot of people get a real thrill out of the fact its illegal that causes them to drink more
6428439 we sealed the deal this morning stars bought him outright since he was still under contract to wits for another year and there was another club interested in the player
6428440 i am glad that we have a player of moleyanes calibre in our team we signed him as a free agent after he brought his clearance with him from fc ak where i believe his contract had expired
6428441 we have now closed our books for now and will not be signing anyone unless of course we find someone special really special we still have one foreign space open and have gift kampamba training but the coach has yet to decide on him
6428442 i had made all the arrangements with chiefs but when i returned from the holidays i had this invitation for trials with antalyaspor i had said it before that when a move to an overseas club transpired i would take it so i took it
6428443 life is good here in turkey but what is bugging me is the work permit if i do get my papers soon i will sign a contract for two years because that is what they have promised me
6428444 i joined alpha media group with the intention of assembling a world class executive team able to build upon the companys great brands with stephen and glenn now on board we have the right team in place to accomplish those goals and it is time for me to step back from day to day operations
6428445 nosso time sofreu mas jogou com vontade e venceu sob os olhares de um p blico incr vel

6428450 this is a public health crisis and we need control mechanisms in place
6428451 florida did once accidentally release a list of aids patients
6428452 we expected today to be about gcse results and what you then find is one of the youngsters who has worked very hard for their gcses has been the victim of this tragedy
6428453 ahmeds only been here a year ive spoken to his family this morning and they are proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6428454 the victim was with a group of friends on the 13th floor of a tower block when they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block
6428455 he climbed onto the outside of the tower block via an open balcony and then climbed down several floors to escape
6428456 the other group involved are described as black male youths
6428457 it definitely is a little different ive offered to have other people go with me but no ones taken me up on it
6428458 its not only cheap to camp you really experience the city more
6428459 for me camping at the convention is just a place to sleep
6428460 im happy to support senator mccain it would be great if he chose mitt romney as his running mate but we probably wont know that until the convention
6428461 you get to see a lot of people not just from massachusetts but from all over the country
6428462 her attitude is go ahead and do it but she has no interest in camping
6428463 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain senator mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6428464 what he refused to do on behalf of the democratic ticket
6428465 now willing to do on behalf of the republican party
6428466 hes going to iraq but hes already decided his position hes not going to listen to general david petraeus hes not going to listen to our troops i think thats not the kind of leadership we need in the oval office
6428467 senator lieberman has always been there for senator reid even on close votes except for iraq
6428468 we face a very real threat in global terror threats from radical islam nuclear iran
6428469 the coalition of republicans and independents and conservative democrats that ultimately will elect john mccain in the fall
6428470 there was phenomenal excitement when gore picked lieberman in 2000
6428471 it was an extraordinary moment in american jewish history but now that is ancient history
6428472 michigan is clearly in play but neither party seems to recognize that in terms of speakers at the convention
6428473 you would think both parties would be making a more concerted effort toward michigan
6428474 its very important for me to get a chance to talk about creating good paying jobs
6428475 who knows more about how important that is than someone from michigan
6428476 is a work in progress that could change in coming days sen obama is totally committed to michigan i think youll see that reflected at the convention
6428477 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
6428478 valuable because not everyone sits in front of a computer or a television
6428479 at getting votes on election day and communicating the messages that we feel are important to our supporters
6428480 text messaging is really powerful if i have a text message i can forward that text message to over 100 people in my cell phone list
6428481 its going to be read by every single person have you ever not read a text message
6428482 ms taylor is at home and happy and busier than ever
6428483 shes living her life shes been having dinner with friends shes working
6428484 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6428485 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6428486 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6428487 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6428488 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6428489 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6428490 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6428491 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6428492 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6428493 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6428494 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6428495 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6428496 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6428497 on ne peut que se f liciter des efforts de la f d ration
6428498 mais il faudrait aussi se demander si lactuelle recherche du degr z ro de m dicaments est une bonne chose pour les chevaux
6428499 de hoge brandstofprijzen in combinatie met technologische doorbraken en dalende kosten zullen in het voordeel van hernieuwbare energiebronnen spelen
6428500 de investeringen in hernieuwbare energie stegen in 2006 met 43 procent tegenover 2005
6428501 hoewel de omstandigheden er goed zijn hadden ze het gevoel op een enorme voorraad olie en gas te zitten die nooit zou opraken ze gingen dan ook niet op zoek naar alternatieven
6428502 to be publisher here in l a you need a local and i am a local
6428503 the average journalist in los angeles does about 51 pages a year but the average journalist in hartford or baltimore does over 300 pages a year and then when you get the individuals you will find out that you can eliminate a fair number of people while eliminating not very much content
6428504 my focus is not to look at this thing i dont know anything about job cuts i dont and i think thats all in the realm of the ceo
6428505 making the los angeles times a different kind of property one that thinks differently tries out new products puts together new distribution partnerships something the new publisher brings in his experience all makes it a more desirable property if and when a buyer emerges
6428506 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6428507 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6428508 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6428509 i would have liked to see it go much slower
6428510 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6428511 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6428512 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6428513 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6428514 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6428515 some of our provinces are running out of money to provide primary care im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6428516 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6428517 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6428518 when you get a letter saying this is what you need to do to protect your girls of course you do it
6428519 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer
6428520 i understand that the information i provide will be used by merck or those working on behalf of merck for market research purposes
6428521 to make sure they are providing accurate information in accordance with f d a approved labeling and to make sure dissemination of information is always appropriate
6428522 hpv is a very important health issue for college students
6428523 we are a poor nonprofit and ive been working on this issue for years
6428524 it is a very easy step that we can take to prevent a sometimes deadly but certainly serious form of cancer
6428525 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6428526 well worry about whether boosters are needed down the road
6428527 gardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks
6428528 her parents are scientists they know better than to assume gardasil caused her disease
6428529 you inevitably find adverse events that you wouldnt have suspected
6428530 cervical cancer is a worthwhile disease to prevent in a country that has the resources
6428531 are you really going to say a girl cant start school because she hasnt had this vaccine
6428532 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6428533 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 complete inventory of all e mails
6428534 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6428535 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly 10 i can only take you so seriously
6428536 reflect mccains vision of an america in pursuit of peace and seen as a beacon of goodwill and hope throughout the world
6428537 were focused on the storm and the health safety and welfare of floridians
6428538 those tea leaves can be shuffled at a moments notice
6428539 its all designed just to keep everyone guessing and speculating generating more coverage
6428540 i honor his service i dont honor his policies i dont honor his politics
6428541 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6428542 you think you can win by taking the higher ground i worry about you
6428543 im skinny but im tough we will hit back with the truth
6428544 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6428545 sen obama got a little testy on this issue he said i was questioning his patriotism let me be clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6428546 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6428547 im convinced that enocean can tap this enormous market potential with its technology for energy efficient solutions you might say enocean technology is the quasi foundation for smart green buildings
6428548 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good
6428549 the recent stories about amy going into rehab near blakes prison are not true
6428550 if the devil wears prada were a reality show it would be good afternoon bbcrazies
6428551 one of the stones in section 60 has sunk and a family member has requested that it be raised today
6428552 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family and she knows how disappointed her father and i are i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6428553 a half mile ocean swim an 18 mile out and back bike course and a 4 mile out and back run course
6428554 she couldnt understand why everyone is talking about that swimmer
6428555 she couldnt come up with michael phelps name and then she yammered on about how she was the one training for a triathlon just six months after giving birth and how that was the big story right now not the swimmer

6428560 i was crying when i was born because i knew right there and then that i was born with the wrong sexual organ
6428561 i endured nine months of conception and i was praying for a vagina all that time so you would imagine my horror when i found out that somebody made a mistake and gave me a dick on my birthday
6428562 falamos com o milan mas ainda estamos na fase inicial das negocia es
6428563 its our understanding that hes arrived in bangkok he will either try to go somewhere else or come back to the uk
6428564 ahmeds only been here a year the great achievement is he achieved 9 gcses ive spoken to his family this morning and they are most proud of the fact that he got a c in maths and a c in science he also got two other c grades
6428565 ive heard that he saw a gang chasing someone else and he thought they were carrying knives apparently when he saw the knives he started to run towards the flats and the gang chased him
6428566 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6428567 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6428568 he learns so much because he has physical contact all the time
6428569 nonprofits are just trying to keep their head above water the real story is increasing demand people are losing jobs stress levels are up violence will increase people are going to go crazy
6428570 i dont think youve even seen the ramifications of whats going to face us in the upcoming year
6428571 for every person who comes into the program there are probably three or four more who need it
6428572 there are a lot of people who turn us away because they think were a policing agency
6428573 de sp is niet enkel voor de verkiezingen ge nteresseerd in jouw mening maar altijd en overal
6428574 een vitale democratie kan niet zonder actief betrokken burgers en openbaar debat over onze gezamenlijke toekomst
6428575 de vrijheid van meningsuiting is absoluut ze is een groot en belangrijk goed n ze is er niet alleen voor gelijkgestemden in een democratische rechtsstaat geniet ook de tegenstander die vrijheid
6428576 ik werd uitgescholden voor verrader mensen uit de landelijke partijtop weigerden mij de hand te schudden of keken de andere kant op als ik langsliep
6428577 hoewel de landelijke sp het beeld uitdraagt dat je kritisch mag zijn merk ik dat ik toch werd afgerekend op mijn steun aan toine
6428578 ze dragen nu eenmaal ook het meeste af dus mogen ze ook veel declareren
6428579 waar andere volksvertegenwoordigers hun onkosten alleen tot een bepaalde limiet krijgen vergoed gelden voor spers geen maxima
6428580 de voortschrijdende verschraling van de democratie binnen de socialistische partij de toenemende werkdruk en een te lage financi le beloning zijn drie andere redenen die mij tot dit besluit doen brengen
6428581 wat een flinke dame dat zij het toch nog zo lang heeft volgehouden als sp statenlid want helaas sinds de schellen mij van de ogen zijn gevallen kan ik mij als simpel voorheen tamelijk actief lid maar al te goed voorstellen dat het een moeilijke tijd voor haar moet zijn geweest
6428582 aan jou aan sonja aan elizabeh aan toine aan henk aan duzgun jullie verwijt ik dat je niet strijdt voor democratie binnen de sp maar dat je strijdt tegen de sp en waar de sp voor staat
6428583 eigen rechter spelen moet natuurlijk te allen tijde voorkomen worden
6428584 als je iets wilt veranderen lukt dat niet door op te stappen maar door te blijven en te blijven praten
6428585 aan jou aan sonja aan elizabeh aan toine aan henk aan duzgun jullie verwijt ik dat je niet strijdt voor democratie binnen de sp maar dat je strijdt tegen de sp en waar de sp voor staat
6428586 met opbouwende kritiek bedoel ik probeer door praten voorstellen voor verbetering erdoor te krjgen zonder altijd alleen maar kritiek te hebben
6428587 halsstarrig zijn ook alle ex sp leden die hun zetel niet terug geven als ze eruit stappen in de meeste gevallen zijn ze niet met voorkeur gekozen maar gewoon omdat ze nummer zoveel waren op de kieslijst het is dus niet hun zetel maar de zetel van de sp waarop zij mochten zitten
6428588 als kiezer heb ik me afgevraagd wil ik dat mensen die z leiding geven aan n van de grootste partijen van ons land uiteindelijk k z leiding kunnen gaan geven aan ons land mijn conclusie was en is nee dat wil ik niet
6428589 aan jou aan sonja aan elizabeh aan toine aan henk aan duzgun jullie verwijt ik dat je niet strijdt voor democratie binnen de sp maar dat je strijdt tegen de sp en waar de sp voor staat
6428590 dat zul je echt zelf moeten doen door steeds te blijven vragen
6428591 ik werd uitgescholden voor verrader mensen uit de landelijke partijtop weigerden mij de hand te schudden of keken de andere kant op als ik langsliep
6428592 volgens mij is er niets mis met de juridische gang van zaken rond de afdrachtregeling daar is al meerdere malen juridisch onderzoek gedaan door de tk gemeenten en diverse staten
6428593 als je weigert te tekenen betekent dat je politieke dood
6428594 een besluit van een orgaan van een rechtspersoon dat in strijd is met de wet of de statuten is nietig tenzij uit de wet iets anders voortvloeit
6428595 een besluit van een orgaan van een rechtspersoon is onverminderd het elders in de wet omtrent de mogelijkheid van een vernietiging bepaalde vernietigbaar a wegens strijd met wettelijke of statutaire bepalingen die het tot stand komen van besluiten regelen b wegens strijd met de redelijkheid en de billijkheid die door artikel 8 worden ge ist zie ook art 12 boek 3 bw c wegens strijd met een reglement
6428596 een rechtshandeling is vernietigbaar wanneer zij door bedreiging door bedrog of misbruik van omstandigheden is tot stand gekomen
6428597 door de cessie verwordt de volksvertegenwoordiger tot een werknemer van de partij die maandelijks maar afwachten of hij zijn geld krijgt zo ontstaat een verhouding tussen partij en volksvertegenwoordiger die in strijd is met het vrij mandaat om die reden is de cessie ongeldig
6428598 een onwenselijk aspect van die partijorganisatie is dat de sp de staat provincies en gemeenten de bezoldiging van haar volksvertegenwoordigers rechtstreeks aan zichzelf laat uitbetalen deze gewoonte is in strijd met het vrij mandaat en zou daarom gestaakt moeten worden
6428599 door de cessie verwordt de volksvertegenwoordiger tot een werknemer van de partij die maandelijks maar afwachten of hij zijn geld krijgt zo ontstaat een verhouding tussen partij en volksvertegenwoordiger
6428600 overigens kiest de sp volksvertegenwoordiger zelf voor de betalingsregeling die hij zij wil doen
6428601 de sp stelt in haar eigen overeenkomsten waar ook de sp aan moet voldoen
6428602 de redevoeringen van bovengenoemde lijken mij vrij partijdig maar dat hoeft niet maar kan ook getuigen van onjuiste niet complete analyse van de gegevens
6428603 leden van de vereniging welke namens de vereniging zitting hebben of hebben gehad in openbare lichamen dragen de hen uit hoofde van die functie toekomende geldelijke vergoeding af aan de vereniging waartegenover de vereniging hen de garantie geeft dat zij geen financieel nadeel zullen ondervinden van de uitoefening van deze functie
6428604 deze gewoonte is in strijd met het vrij mandaat en zou daarom gestaakt moeten worden
6428605 zo ontstaat een verhouding tussen partij en volksvertegenwoordiger die in strijd is met het vrij mandaat om die reden is de cessie ongeldig
6428606 het vrij mandaat houdt in dat de staatsrechtelijke bevoegdheden van een volksvertegenwoordiger aan deze volksvertegenwoordiger persoonlijk en niet aan zijn fractie partij of een ander zijn toegekend het mondelinge en schriftelijke vragenrecht het recht om over moties of wetvoorstellen te stemmen en het recht om vrijwillig afstand te doen van zijn zetel komen onvervreemdbaar aan de volksvertegenwoordiger zelf toe
6428607 zo stapte ali lazrak in 2004 uit de sp fractie in de tweede kamer bij het verlaten van zijn fractie kon hij vanwege zijn vrije mandaat zijn zetel gewoon behouden zodat hij tot ergernis van de sp een eenmansfractie in de tweede kamer kon vormen
6428608 stel je eens voor jij kunt een baan krijgen bij de overheid vervolgens stelt je afdelingschef voor jou een contract op dat hij jouw volledige loon krijgt van de overheid op zijn rekening krijgt gestort en dat hij daarvan de helft aan jou uitkeert en niet alleen dat hij wil ook de belastingvoordelen terugontvangen
6428609 afdrachtregeling volgens nl gemeenten moet gewoon aan worden voldaan zie eerdere bijlage
6428610 de sgp nam de redenering van de rechtsgeleerden over en leed liever honger dan zich in een omstreden positie te manoeuvreren
6428611 en als laatste de vraag is of de wetsartikelen behandelende de
6428612 het ene behandelt hoe de partijraad bij bestuursverkiezingen een bindende voordracht van het congres kan verwerpen en het andere regelt de onschendbaarheid van de politieke top binnen het partijbestuur de politieke top wiens aanwezigheid als bestuurslid weer statutair is geregeld allemaal waarschijnlijk heel rechtsgeldig maar daarentegen met zekerheid uitermate ondemocratisch
6428613 onder datzelfde vrije mandaat valt ook het stemmen zonder last uit e e a valt te concluderen dat het wurgcontract van de sp met haar werknemers en partijkasvullers niet rechtsgeldig is en dus ordinaire handjeklap en dus achterkamertjespolitiek
6428614 en ook dat alle afdrachtenaren er blijkbaar geen democratische principes op nahouden ook komen zodoende door dat filter alleen maar volgzame types in de partij
6428615 je moet er niet aan denken dat dat een land zou moeten gaan besturen
6428616 je weet nooit van tevoren of iets uberhaupt kan dus het zou waanzin zijn als besluiten op het congres kosten wat het kost moeten worden opgevolgd
6428617 het 1 betekent wel consequenties voor het ander en die zijn geheel rechtsgeldig
6428618 overigens snap ik die achterkamertjepolitiek ook niet helemaal het is volgens mij algemeen bekend
6428619 wanneer de partijen of fracties deze regelingen willen benutten om kamerleden tegen hun zin in het gareel te krijgen dan kunnen die zich met succes beroepen op het grondwettelijke lastverbod in de praktijk blijkt echter dat de fractieleden behoorlijk volgzaam zijn of dit nu uit loyaliteit voorkomt of door de dreiging van sancties zo blijkt uit de weinige beschikbare gegevens over afwijkend stemgedrag in de tweede kamer
6428620 omdat ze zich aan wetten en regels houden juridisch en ethisch doen ze niets fout
6428621 een heel lang stuk sjaak waarin je uitgebreid bespreekt en toegeeft dat sp verenigingsregelgeving bij geschil ondergeschikt is aan datgene wat de wet erover zegt
6428622 je hebt lang gedraaid en gekronkeld maar uiteindelijk zeg je zij het in andere bewoordingen hetzelfde als sonja in 87
6428623 wie bepaald of iets niet haalbaar is en hoe zou jij het vinden als de bevolking van een stad een zwerver die zijn eigen partijtje heeft opgericht en een onzinnig nooit haalbaar partijprogramma voorstaat is trouwens niet eens hypothetisch genoeg stemmen krijgt om een raadszetel te kunnen claimen door het college vergelijkbaar met de partijraad want die is ook niet gekozen geweigerd zou worden
6428624 volgens mij zijn dat de nadelen van een democratie waar we mee moeten leren leven en maar hopen dat over het algemeen het mensdom rationeel kiest en denkt
6428625 als het congres unaniem een bindende voordracht voor een bestuurslid afgeeft is het niet aan de partijraad om dat weg te wuiven
6428626 voelt een lid zich tekort gedaan door verenigingswetgeving dan kan hij zijn recht zoeken in de wetgeving
6428627 vind hij daar zijn gelijk dan betekent dat dus dat de wetgeving zwaarder weegt dan de verenigingsregels die op dat punt dan ook worden beschouwd als niet te bestaan
6428628 ondertussen mag de sp gewoon doorgaan met het handhaven en toepassen van zijn regeltjes tot de volgende opstaat en zijn recht ergens anders gaat zoeken
6428629 alleen verdraai jij de feiten door te stellen dat het vrije mandaat niet ter discussie staat maar je alleen je lidmaatschap verliest als je het met de regelgeving niet eens bent dat is duidelijk en ook een beetje kinderachtig
6428630 de sp regelgeving voordracht van het congres zelfs een bindende is op dat punt te vergelijken met een raadgevend referendum de veiligheidsklep is er van te voren al ingebouwd en wordt bediend door het hoogste orgaan binnen de partij de partijraad en hoe die in elkaar zit weten we ook
6428631 gelukkig dat het gros van de bevolking redelijk zelfstandig en goed opgeleid is die prikken er wel doorheen als ze zich er eens in gaan verdiepen
6428632 uitspraken meningen en zienswijzen zoals die van schutgens b v wil hij helemaal niet lezen waarom niet ook daar krijg ik geen zinnig antwoord op is klaarblijkelijk overtuigt van zijn eigen partijvisie en wil niet de kans lopen dat hij gaat twijfelen
6428633 hoeveel van dergelijke types lopen er rond binnen de sp of bekleden vertegenwoordigende functies
6428634 moet de partij blij zijn met dergelijke types binnen zijn kader
6428635 het feit dat wij hier en anderen mischien wel ergens anders zo druk over het democratisch gehalte van de sp praten is gelegen in het feit dat dgr bij herhaling in de media te kennen heeft gegeven dat de sp de meest democratische partij van nederland is
6428636 de sp is democratischer omdat de leden meer invloed hebben in uitvoering van het politieke programma en bestuur
6428637 ook in het recht kun je allerlei regels rekenkundig aan elkaar verbinden maar de constructie van het burgerlijk wetboek en de rechtsfilosofie maakt dat het rechtssysteem dusdanig in elkaar zit dat je niet zomaar een aantal regeltjes wetten aan elkaar kan koppelen om je gelijk te halen
6428638 ik zou antipode willen voorstellen om naar de rechter te gaan en het aan haar voor te leggen en sjaak willen adviseren geen energie te steken in mensen die niet voor het debat willen gaan maar alleen hun gelijk willen halen koste wat kost

6428667 we have more behavioral kinds of things like do you access your account during the week or during the weekends
6428668 all those things go into the model for you so that we can predict what you might do next theres no single profile theres no single indicator theres no rule if you will its all very complex multi dimensional prediction of things that you might do and then were comparing the new activity to how likely we think that would be you versus how likely we think that activity might be someone else

6428715 the circumstances in the lives of these individuals that precipitate the anxiety or depression or exacerbate those conditions are as unique as there are individuals on this campus
6428716 there are different dynamics in their ability to relate to the campus and others on campus their family dynamics their academic struggles or failure or success in making connections or building a social network
6428717 college students sometimes have more choices and pressures and the feeling that they have to be perfect
6428718 they want to succeed and they want relationships to work
6428719 in addition to screening for depression and anxiety disorders when we meet with students in counseling one of the things we assess for is whether substance abuse is affecting them sometimes binge drinking or drug use contributes to academic struggles or is part of a students mood problem
6428720 some students slide into a binge drinking lifestyle they arent paying attention to how much they drink or the consequences of their drinking other students may drink in order to deal with untreated depression or anxiety including social anxiety
6428721 invading privacy is one of the most common reasons for individuals who are in a position to help for not reaching out and offering that assistance
6428722 the truth is if the individual has been giving signals that they are in trouble and in need of help they are typically appreciative of someone intervening in a way that can help them find some relief for their pain
6428723 without being too aggressive about it look for the cues and respond with a fairly benign response such as you havent been your old self or is there something you want to talk about give a stimulus like that and if the person is truly in need and trusts you they will likely disclose what is going on for them then its important for you to know whats available to help them
6428724 some parents are very tuned in to their students and have a relationship where they can talk about issues and help them get into services
6428725 in those situations the role parents play is very important its tricky because it is at a time in life when students are branching out on their own and often want to be independent balancing offering support and getting students in for needed services as well as encouraging them to take care of themselves is important
6428726 sometimes just talking to a roommate or friend in a meaningful way helps relieve things or even resolve it
6428727 there may however be some more entrenched circumstances where professional help might be in order thats the point at which an individual can be aware of the counseling center or know where to look for what help might be available
6428728 sometimes a dark themed paper is just the topic of choice as a creative effort
6428729 in certain other cases it is a more obvious statement from an individual who is troubled or potentially at risk i think if a faculty member has any doubt they can certainly bring it to the attention of me or my staff because there are some things we might be able to pick up from the background and information that would suggest the student is at risk we can consult with a faculty member about determining the nature of the risk and how to address that with the individual
6428730 behaviors involving substance abuse and eating disorders are serving a coping function
6428731 there is something the student is getting from the behavior and that makes it harder for them to want to give it up on the one hand they know its not good to be binge drinking or binging and purging but on the other they think it helps with the anxiety they are feeling when we see students about other issues we try to connect the condition and behaviors with their consequences to try to increase motivation to work on their problems
6428732 we review treatment choices and decide with the student what is the best plan
6428733 i was never really on trial i went there to finalise negotiations and put pen to paper after i had seen the set up at the club however i didnt sign for them in the end because they ended up offering me only about 30 percent of what they initially promised
6428734 when i arrived they said i should accept the lower salary and sign for a season they said when they gained promotion to the top league they would increase my salary
6428735 but i couldnt accept their offer israel is far away and i have a family to look after it is better to be paid that kind of money when you playing in africa and closer to your family
6428736 there is a nigerian player at the club who is also leaving because he had money differences with the club after he picked up a career threatening injury there
6428737 las palabras del obispo li shan dijo el vocero vaticano manifiestan que todos los cat licos chinos aman y respetan al papa reconocen su autoridad y estar an contentos de encontrarlo y ste es un aspecto muy positivo y alentador
6428738 la entrevista del obispo li shan seg n lombardi puede ser considerada una de las se ales con las cuales de parte china responde a la apertura manifestada por el papa en su carta a los chinos de hace un a o para intentar una normalizaci n de las relaciones entre china y el vaticano

6428752 i believe we are seeing the beginning of movements like that again right here in america and that we are poised on the edge of what might become a revival that will bring about big changes in the world historically social reform often requires spiritual revival and thats what church historians always say about real revival that it changes things in the society not just in peoples inner lives i believe that what we are seeing now may be the beginning of a new revival a revival for justice
6428753 and there are those who simply believe that by definition god is unknowable to our limited fallible human minds and souls

6428768 alright guys its official as of sat 10th of may at 15 49 gmt im giving up pivot completely i might animate again in it if peter ever makes a new version the reason im quitting is stated thus pivot has stayed the same for too long ive had this conversation with countless people on msn which has only served to reaffirm my lack of interest in animating in pivot any more making something in pivot thats ground breaking now takes far too much time for far too little gain whereas programs like flash and photoshop offer new challenges at least to me long story short pivot is gay lol so anyway heres a little taste of what im working on with flash and ps at the moment click here ill also be doing writing as well but i wont show you guys that because its rather vociferous
6428769 you are trying to make our country a christian nation
6428770 i came downstairs and caught one crapping on the sofa and the other in the corner of the room it was an unpoetic moment i just completely lost all control
6428771 they were messing about in the house and i was having a bad day and i just lost it
6428772 i was holding them under the water in the bathroom
6428773 i was trying to keep the place tidy and they were s ing on the sofas and stuff and i just lost my cool completely
6428774 in the couple of months leading up to what happened i went through a great amount of stress and frustration due to hard work and it was the first time i was living by myself
6428775 i put so much pressure on myself to try to make everything perfect i really lost the plot very badly
6428776 i had just quit my job and i had been falling out with friends and everything seemed to be going wrong
6428777 it was something would never dream of doing and im very sorry for it
6428778 this was a prolonged attack you tortured those cats and caused them serious injuries one had rattling lungs we take on board you are seeing a counsellor for stress and anger management but this is so serious a custodial sentence of 12 months would be appropriate

6428787 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6428788 this is a case of conversion from christianity to islam so we can say there is pressure especially from fundamentalist groups
6428789 they are giving them misinformation regarding their parents saying if you return to your parents they will kill you
6428790 there is no example in islamic history of minor girls who converted to islam without permission or the presence of their legal guardian
6428791 women do not have full capacity to give testimony in court how is it possible to accept the statement they have embraced islam
6428792 it will not be fruitful for us because saba herself has claimed she is married

6428800 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
6428801 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation
6428802 then there are small cap value index funds and large cap growth funds
6428803 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
6428804 a random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past actions
6428805 on wall street the term random walk is an obscenity
6428806 i wrote in the first edition that a blindfolded chimpanzee throwing darts at the wall street journal could select a portfolio that would do as well as the experts
6428807 through the past thirty years more than two thirds of professional portfolio managers have been outperformed by the unmanaged s amp p 500 index
6428808 all too many investors are lazy and careless a terrifying combination when greed gets control of the market and everyone wants to cash in on the latest craze or fad
6428809 it is not really hard to make money in the market
6428810 with index funds you know exactly what you are getting and the investment process is made incredibly simple
6428811 the most important decision you will probably ever make concerns the balancing of asset categories stocks bonds real estate money market securities etc at different stages of your life
6428812 according to roger ibbotson more than 90 of an investors total return is determined by the asset categories that are selected and their overall proportional representation
6428813 in the 1990s the ratio of buy to sell recommendations climbed to 100 to 1 particularly by brokerage firms with large investment banking businesses
6428814 stock investors can do no better than simply buying and holding a fund that owns a representative sample of all the stocks in the market
6428815 i am convinced that no one will be successful in using technical methods to get above average returns in the stock market
6428816 simply buying and holding a diversified portfolio suited to your objectives will enable you to save on investment expense brokerage charges and taxes
6428817 every investor must decide the trade off he or she is willing to make between eating well and sleeping well
6428818 again and again yesterdays star fund has proven to be todays disaster
6428819 the laws of chance do operate and they can explain some amazing success stories
6428820 it turns out that the portfolio with the least risk 1970 2002 had 24 foreign securities and 76 u s securities
6428821 what worked in the past does not necessarily work in the future
6428822 i strongly suggest you invest some of your assets in reits
6428823 the current inventory of gold is some 50 times its annual industrial requirement
6428824 beta as it is usually measured is not a substitute for brains
6428825 there is never going to be a handsome genie who will appear and solve all our investment problems
6428826 buying and holding a broad based market index fund is still the only game in town
6428827 any truly repetitive and exploitable pattern that can be discovered in the stock market and can be arbitraged away will self destruct
6428828 given enough time and massaging of data series it is possible to tease almost any pattern out of most data sets
6428829 clearly buying a portfolio of small firms is hardly a surefire technique to enable an investor to earn abnormally high risk adjusted returns
6428830 over a period running back to the 1930s it does not appear that investors could actually have realized higher rates of return from mutual funds specializing in value stocks
6428831 i am convinced that many studies have been flawed by the phenomenon of survivorship bias
6428832 the more profitable any return predictability appears to be the less likely it is to survive
6428833 i have yet to see any compelling evidence that past stock prices can be used to predict future stock prices
6428834 never buy anything from someone who is out of breath
6428835 the decision of which ira is best for you and whether to convert can be a tough call
6428836 for investors who are very risk averse i favor gnma funds
6428837 own your own home if you can possibly afford it
6428838 if your expected investment period is only for a decade or less no one can predict the returns you will receive with any degree of accuracy
6428839 there aint no such thing as a free lunch higher risk is the price one pays for more generous returns
6428840 switching your investment around in a futile attempt to time the market will only involve extra commissions for your broker extra taxes for the government and poorer net performance
6428841 dollar cost averaging can reduce the risks of investing in stocks and bonds
6428842 dont think that dollar cost averaging will solve all of your problems
6428843 what goes down must come back up but this does not necessarily hold for individual stocks just for the market in general
6428844 the key to whether any recommended asset allocation works for you is whether you are able to sleep at night
6428845 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation
6428846 i have become increasingly convinced that the past records of mutual fund managers are essentially worthless in predicting future success
6428847 luck may be 99 percent responsible for the success of the very few people who have beaten the averages
6428848 the mutual fund industry has developed a system of charging expenses to investors that is as complicated as irs income tax regulations and equally unpleasant
6428849 i have often said that the two best things that have happened to the mutual fund industry are the arrival of jack bogle of vanguard and don phillips of morningstar
6428850 aon consultings replacement ratio study shows the impact on workers who are not saving enough for retirement

6428862 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements

6428871 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6428872 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6428873 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6428874 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6428875 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6428876 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians

6428915 i wish i would have had three great balls were played and all i had to do was put the ball in the back of the net
6428916 they were better they came on the field ready to play they were aggressive they made plays when they needed to make plays they got an early lead and after that it was just a matter of how many we were going to concede on the night
6428917 basically we didnt play very well and it didnt go our way we have to move on we have a game on saturday we have to prepare for we need a result thats all there is to say
6428918 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6428919 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6428920 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6428921 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6428922 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6428923 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid
6428924 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6428925 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6428926 the autoimmune epidemic by donna jackson nakazawa is an astounding book
6428927 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6428928 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6428929 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6428930 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
6428931 there are drugs on the market for oa treatment but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
6428932 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
6428933 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
6428934 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
6428935 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signaling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6428936 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives furthermore since mice engineered to have less smurf1 expression develop thicker bones future drugs that shut down smurf1 may be also useful against more common forms of osteoporosis simply by changing the dose of course this is early stage work with many obstacles ahead but it is exciting nonetheless
6428937 our over all hypothesis is that in inflammatory diseases like ra the function of a group of enzymes like smurf1 gets turned on to cause proteasome degradation of key regulator proteins leading to bone loss
6428938 the real future solution will involve a treatment that specifically addresses each of these
6428939 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6428940 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed
6428941 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6428942 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6428943 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6428944 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6428948 problems with the use and sizing of graduated compression stockings are common throughout the country and this study is one of the first to systematically analyze the problems and recommend ways to improve practice
6428949 based on the study findings we recommend that knee length stockings be the standard length used and that the education of nurses and patients about the proper use of stockings be improved
6428950 a lot can be done to optimize the benefits of graduated compression stockings and minimize adverse effects
6428951 knee length stockings have many practical advantages over thigh length in that they lower the risk of problems and health care costs the improper use and sizing of these stockings and the deficiencies in patient education are important health care issues

6428957 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6428958 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6428959 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6428960 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6428961 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect

6428965 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6428966 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6428967 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6428968 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin

6428971 despite media coverage of alcohol related problems at sporting events there has been surprisingly little published research addressing alcohol use sales or problems at professional sport stadiums in the u s
6428972 this is the first study that we know of that looked systematically at the likelihood of illegal alcohol sales at professional sport stadiums across a larger number of stadiums
6428973 alcohol problems at sports stadiums received considerable press attention in the early 1980s as there were several incidents involving violence in the stadiums and drinking driving incidents stemming from intoxicated fans leaving sporting events
6428974 as a result the national highway traffic safety administration developed a responsible beverage service rbs training program for alcohol servers in stadium venues
6428975 many sports stadiums are known to condone alcohol related rowdy behavior that can easily lead to violence as well as a likely location to begin drinking driving incidents
6428976 nearly one out of five youth who appeared under age 21 could purchase alcohol without age identification at the 16 professional hockey football basketball and baseball stadiums in the u s that we assessed
6428977 approximately three out of four fans who appeared obviously intoxicated could easily purchase alcohol at these professional sporting events what this indicates to me is that we have had some success in emphasizing the importance of not selling alcohol to underage people the likelihood of alcohol establishments selling alcohol to underage youth was 50 to 99 percent across communities during the early 1990s however we still need to get the likelihood of sales to underage youth even lower across all venues and we have significantly more work to do to address sales to obviously intoxicated patrons
6428978 a 74 percent violation rate is simply unacceptable and demonstrates that even basic steps to insure compliance with the law are not being taken second the study confirms what prevention specialists have long suspected that alcohol sales in the stands as opposed to the concessions create high risk for illegal sales
6428979 one reason may be that when alcohol is sold in the stands it may be more difficult for the servers to hear or to see the customer to assess their age and level of intoxication
6428980 the servers may feel pressure to make the sale quickly in the stands to get to all of the customers and to get out of the way of fans who are trying to watch the game giving the server less time to do the proper assessment also we have found that alcohol sales are less likely when managers are present the servers in the stands may feel that they are not being watched as closely by managers compared to the servers located in the booths
6428981 we have found here in california that banning alcohol at beaches has had very positive effects not only in terms of reducing alcohol related violence and rowdiness at the beaches but also for local businesses that initially opposed the bans
6428982 instead of reducing the number of beachgoers as was feared it actually increased use of the beaches and increased sales in nearby businesses with the reduction in intoxicated beachgoers people put off by the disruption started coming in greater numbers particularly families i believe the same phenomenon will occur at sports stadiums
6428983 illegal alcohol sales affect more people than just those who are served the alcohol
6428984 as youth and adults become more intoxicated they may cause disruptions get into arguments or injure other fans attending the games after leaving the events they may damage property surrounding the stadiums or get behind the wheel and crash into other fans or individuals in the community this really is a larger problem that needs to be addressed by every community that houses a professional sport stadium
6428985 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
6428986 our results are the best prediction we can make with the information available now but it will be critical to update the analysis as we learn more about the long term vaccine effects
6428987 they are lying how can i disrupt slama it is the international federation who wants every discipline to get an identity

6428989 its over i would rather have the marbergs receive community service but this actually might deter them from any further pranks getting out of hand
6428990 a lot of people do come in and say wheres the bird in the newspaper its very social now its a little pudgy thing
6428991 some republicans will do interviews on the sets of television networks operating in the pepsi center meaning they and the staff escorting them will have access to the site

6429000 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6429001 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6429002 thanks to the men of vision at the namibia rugby union under the often controversial leadership of dirk conradie who saw it fit to restore the soured relationship between mtc and nru in the interest of the game
6429003 we demonstrate that commitment today with this sendoff of the national under 19 rugby team to represent us in tunis
6429004 our only wish is that all these efforts are sped up so that we can see the fruits of our labour soonest
6429005 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6429006 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6429007 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6429008 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6429009 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6429010 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6429011 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6429012 one just because i think it really captures where i was going with the whole issue of balancing market sensibilities with moral sentiment one of my favorite quotes is you know that famous robert f kennedy quote about the measure of our g d p
6429013 well ill send it to you because its one of the most beautiful of his speeches
6429014 counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them
6429015 the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play
6429016 the fact that people here exchange more things than before
6429017 no longer insures that most families will benefit from its growth
6429018 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
6429019 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
6429020 and that these markets are created by different actors in different times and places often by performing theories about how the world should work
6429021 security threats both online and offline have increased dramatically over the last few years and with 16 year olds hacking into network servers and mainframes we believe we cannot afford to ignore potential security risks even when we already have advanced security systems in place
6429022 we handle a wide variety of outsourced processes such as telemarketing customer support records retrieval accounting amp finance and many others all of which involve the sharing of confidential data and information either related to clients or their customers we very well understand the importance of ensuring the security of confidential data and information and its the same reason why we have decided to upgrade our security systems
6429023 for offline threats we have installed the latest biometric security systems that are virtually impossible to tamper with
6429024 as for online security threats we have installed advanced network monitoring systems that keep a log of each and every activity and of every individual unit connected to the network
6429025 we have also installed special software systems that can automatically detect a security breach based on the parameters provided and set the alarm bells ringing in our network security department security threats may also arise from outside sources and keeping that in mind we have also installed the most advanced firewall and anti virus systems on our network servers all these together are helping us sustain our clean record and also in making our offshore outsourcing center one of the most secure in the industry

6429032 reactive oxygen species lead to oxidative stress in the body which can also cause dna damage we were able to gather clear evidence of a short term increase in certain indicators for oxidative stress during the competition and have already published these results however now we were also able to demonstrate that despite this increase no notable and persistent damage was caused to the athletes dna this is a surprising result which initially appears to contradict the data gathered in similar studies
6429033 the comparable studies analysed different biomarkers for predominantly short lived dna damage our study focused primarily on damage to dna that was subsequently evident in daughter cells following cell division and could therefore be of long term detriment to the body however we can sound the all clear in this respect our study clearly shows that in this case extreme competitive sport did not result in any increase in dna damage

6429037 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6429038 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6429039 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6429040 the negotiators have taken this very very far but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6429041 obviously the american forces are here coalition forces are here at the invitation of the iraqi government
6429042 what were trying to do is put together an agreement that protects our people respects iraqs sovereignty
6429043 but the goal is to have iraqi forces responsible for the security of iraq
6429044 that is the goal and that has been the goal from the beginning
6429045 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6429046 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6429047 really we are very very close to closing this agreement
6429048 and as we said from the beginning there is no hidden agenda here
6429049 but really we are redoubling our efforts to bring this to a successful conclusion
6429050 we as the sadr movement denounce this dubious visit and such timing we reaffirm our stance of rejecting the long term agreement we demand the iraqi government and on the highest levels not to sign this unjust agreement and we demand the withdrawal of the government as soon as possible

6429054 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6429055 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6429068 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6429080 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6429081 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6429082 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6429083 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6429084 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6429085 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what stands for and believes in

6429101 most physicians in the united states have financial relationships with industry ranging from the acceptance of meals to the receipt of large sums of money for consulting speaking or conducting research
6429102 consumers should absolutely know where their doctor is coming from
6429103 doctors think they wont be influenced by these financial relationships but the research shows that they are
6429104 lets say your investment counselor went on a trip to aruba paid for by a certain company
6429105 then he comes home and recommends you invest in that company wouldnt you be concerned
6429106 look around for hints that your doctor sees a lot of drug reps
6429107 and if you see an extremely attractive impeccably dressed polite person with a briefcase in the waiting room watch out thats most likely a drug rep
6429108 ask the doctor whats the scientific evidence for prescribing that particular drug over another one they must have a scientific reason especially if its a high price brand name drug instead of a generic
6429109 there are circumstances where you want to take this extra step and there are other times where you really dont want to bother

6429122 since the regulators are asleep at the wheel ive introduced legislation to ban bpa in all food and beverage containers and will continue to work to ensure that it is enacted into law
6429123 there is clear credible evidence in the growing number of scientific studies that link bisphenol a to the very health effects we see on the rise today
6429124 the federal governments failure to prevent harm for american citizens is unacceptable when will government learn to err on the side of caution instead of risk equations

6429142 i was trying to do too much on the mound the guys who came in after me brian tallet and all of them they just put the ball over the plate and they put it in play i was trying to do too much on the mound and trying to get them all out myself instead of having the team behind me make plays for me

6429148 will enable consumers to engage in a variety of experiences such as watching videos tracking their favorite stocks or sports teams interacting with friends or staying current on news and information
6429149 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6429150 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6429151 i think its dangerous to view the science through the lens of whether it will help advance a policy proposal in the public arena yes they are probably correct to observe that medium term cooling of apparently non anthropogenic origin will make it harder to persuade the public to take immediate action they are also correct to observe that the long term warming trend is still real despite its coexistence with other cyclical factors at the end of the day if you keep adding a heat absorbing substance to a system receiving thermal radiation eventually youll get a system that is overall warmer at least when averaged over the time scale of cyclical effects
6429152 its fair to say that the latest college rankings from u s news and world report due out aug 22 will be more widely read than the higher education act signed last week by president bush college bound students often use the magazines annual rankings to find the best schools to apply to unfortunately the rankings mainly measure prestige and inputs such as sat scores and fail to satisfy a demand to know which schools deliver on the quality of education achieved by graduates as congress sought to renew the higher education act the bush administration and some in congress wanted government to hold colleges accountable for such learning outcomes billions of taxpayer dollars are spent on these institutions or are given in student loans and yet taxpayers know next to nothing about their return on this investment
6429153 indoctrination itself is not illegitimate in fact it is an intrinsic part of child rearing out of love and concern parents explicitly or implicitly formulate desired outcomes for the young lives they have created parents generally hope their children will adhere to their own traditions and belief systems which they attempt to inculcate the question parents must face is who will do the indoctrinating schooling is an adjunct to child rearing the schooling options available force parents to make decisions regarding the level of autonomy they wish to exercise they retain the greatest control over their childrens developing beliefs by schooling them at home an alternative is to enroll their children in an institution where they are certain the indoctrination conforms to their own values such as a religious school when parents send a child to a tax funded school they sacrifice their autonomy to alien interests

6429168 we are looking for ideas of how londons olympic park can become not just a great place to live work and visit but a place that retains a flavour of the extra ordinary a place with the wow factor a place of magic

6429174 the south african consumer is under severe stress and has therefore cut back frequency of purchase of luxury premium media brand entities such as fhm and heat during the previously measured quarter
6429175 importantly we believe this winter slump is showing signs of abating somewhat as weve been recording very strong sales for fhm and stable circulation for heat subsequent to this quarter
6429176 at ucm we always only claim actual actively purchased single copy newsstand and subscription sales circulation categories such as bulk sales free copies or others are ignored by ucm as they do not represent actively purchased copies our belief is that in the market categories that we operate in single copy actively purchased circulation is coveted by our premium advertisers
6429177 high cover price premium and frequent magazines such as heat are obviously more exposed to a lower frequency of purchase habit by consumers
6429178 but if our recent experience holds true for the rest of the next quarter we could see improvement in frequency of purchase consumer behaviour going into spring

6429558 ive told everyone over and over again that they should be comfortable disagreeing with me but other than some polite alternatives no one seems to have the courage to speak up
6429559 we all know that when the discussion ends were going to do it her way so why bother wasting our time debating
6429560 the ceos mind was made up and that speaking up was unwise
6429561 otherwise overconfident executives sometimes overestimate the career risk of speaking up and meaningfully underestimate the risk of staying silent
6429562 i have seldom seen people hurt their careers by speaking up and appropriately articulating a well thought out contrary position however i have seen many bitter and confused people who stalled their careers by playing it safe

6429591 d do you think the others while come back for us
6429592 i dont know but we have to think about ourselves for now were running low on food and supplies another day or two and well be completely out of food and water
6429593 the fires dimming im stirring the coals around to keep it going
6429594 please dont be mad at me im sorry i pretended to be someone else
6429595 this is why i didnt want to be found out
6429596 i i know but i just dont want to be treated as a kid now im tough and i can do fine on my own if i need to i dont need others giving me things or asking if i need anything
6429597 so i thought that if i changed into someone older someone your age you wouldnt treat me differently and i would be more useful to the group
6429598 if i stayed as myself when we crashed i was sure that i would be a hindrance to the group slowing everyone else down because they would be so worried about me because of my true age
6429599 i first discovered my ability to change when we were trying to escape from tv tokyo
6429600 hey sweetie your father and i will be working pretty late tonight so i prepared your favorite dish spaghetti and meatballs youll just have to warm it in the microwave oven for a few minutes and take it out be careful not to burn yourself on the plate o well probably be home around 1 00 a m or later dont stay up too late and be sure to get up early to make it to your c ute haha little group tomorrow morning love mom
6429601 come on mom im not a little kid anymore its like youre writing to a little child
6429602 you and dad work so late all the time im usually stuck cooking for myself anyway and doing the dishes and washing the table and doing the laundry and folding it afterwards im practically all grown up as it is
6429603 i was at work and overheard something on the radio go to our room and turn on the tv right now
6429604 i just picked up your mother and were on our way home right now
6429605 maimi honey listen to mommy were on our way right now hang in there
6429606 honey you have to listen to me you have to run you have to get away from the house and get to your friends
6429607 yes sweetie you have to get back to your friends no matter what
6429608 nothing sweetie now listen up open the top drawer of our dresser and look for a white envelope inside the white envelope is over 100 000 yen i want you to take it and run as far away from tokyo as you can
6429609 no sweetie you have to go on without us at this rate we cant make it to you
6429610 i know you are were all scared but you have to do this we know you can
6429611 run maimi run and dont look back dont come back for anything save yourself
6429612 maimi you have to save yourself i know you can do it weve seen how much youve grown up and matured far beyond your years
6429613 go maimi go now run and keep on running you have to
6429614 uh yeah im fine just took a spill thats all
6429615 i mean yeah bro just lost control of my horse for a second nothing to worry about
6429616 and thats how i first discovered my ability to morph into other people
6429617 i see so how why not tell any of us even when you already know that were also mutants
6429618 well i saw it as an advantage i could change into someone older and not have to worry about anyone treating me like a scared little kid
6429619 with all youve been through i think youve proven that you can take care of yourself if you need to
6429620 so how far do your powers go can you only copy peoples appearance
6429621 no ive copied other s m a t girls appearances and found i could also mimic some of their powers but theyre much weaker in comparison
6429622 cool wait so you can change into anyone you see
6429623 yes i can make an even better copy if i make physical contact with the person im copying
6429624 i had to think of how i would reassure big that nothing happened with pac
6429625 i hadnt been completely innocent while i was in los angeles id had sex occasionally with

6429630 at telapprise we have always taken customer service very seriously listening to our customers about the telecom issues they face daily over the last year we conducted a series of informal research discussions and the results have strongly influenced the new website navigation and content
6429631 most companies are overwhelmed by the number of choices in purchasing and managing telecom equipment and services
6429632 given the importance of our website as a vehicle for two way communication with our customers it made sense to provide more resources and information to help them sort through their options

6429641 it was a very hard fought game and for us a hard earned three points
6429642 the win is based more on the determination of our team sometimes its necessary to win games in that way it was a game where we relied on the effort team spirit and the mentality of the group
6429643 our experienced players have made the point to the team that qualifying is always difficult away from home
6429644 you have to expect games to be very tough we have played some tough games in the last year but none of them are qualifiers to experience it and to win in that fashion is good for the group
6429645 we knew it wasnt going to be easy one way or another
6429646 we just stuck together it was a great team effort the forwards did a great job of chasing down and the midfield held strong and the defense cleaned it up after that
6429647 theres a lot of other stuff that goes on in that moment with the movement of the other guys on the team
6429648 it was a great service and i was able to get on the end of it we work on stuff like this with gooch clint dempsey brian ching and michael bradley they make good runs and cause confusion in there so i was able to get free
6429649 the name change to telapprise from accucom builds on our already strong market position

6429661 all the indications are that near field communication technology is now set for rapid acceptance and explosive growth
6429662 but basic questions over the business case for nfc remain and there are sharp differences of opinion on how the market will develop
6429663 in many ways nfc shares similarities with the early days of the smart card industry particularly with the electronic purse
6429664 everyone thought cash would be redundant by now and wed all be using electronic money instead
6429665 but the business issues were very complex and in the end consumer demand wasnt strong enough to overcome the commercial barriers
6429666 with nfc though it is different consumers love using nfc and its that consumer demand that is set to drive adoption forward as service providers see the opportunity to use nfc as a competitive differentiator
6429667 jerry yudelson has been a national leader in advancing the business case for green building and green development we hope that our audience will leave with the conviction that green building is good business and something they should be promoting
6429668 having a keynote speaker of jerrys caliber highlights the importance of taking action on the green building imperative we think this conference will greatly accelerate the green building movement in southern california
6429669 this is a huge milestone adding these stores increases our distribution by over 500 and xeko is now able to reach even more fans across the country
6429670 we know that to effect lasting positive change for our planet we must engage children the next generation of eco leaders
6429671 there are some great deals to be made here in the cape fear beach communities
6429672 with both waterfront and beachfront properties available it s a good time to start investigating these opportunities
6429673 at the chuckie goodnight foundation our focus is to teach the children about being kind and respectful of earth
6429674 it is the responsibility of all of us to help restore the health of our planet so that future generations may have a legacy
6429675 it was important to us to create a website that was not only highly informative but also appealing to children in order to generate true excitement about helping earth
6429676 we are confident that the interactive features on the website will inspire much enthusiasm
6429677 air is mixed with the fuel inside the rotor blade that leads to the combustion chamber at the tip of the blade where it passes an ignition system
6429678 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6429679 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6429680 one my daughter uses as a toy shes pretending she has a cell phone
6429681 so people tend to say hey ive got five phones my family isnt using anymore
6429682 its very simple we take any phone we ask our customers to bring them in and drop them off at the store so they can either be recycled appropriately or they can be refurbished for reuse
6429683 they can bring in their cell phones ink cartridges batteries if they have mp3s what they will do is go back to customer service they will tag it and well send it out to a company and they will recycle it from there
6429684 one of them is over 10 years i just look at them you know
6429685 take and hold commitments of 1 billion or more are still quite a lot there will be pressure from the senior banks to launch the deal to a wider syndication
6429686 calling for effective and fervent end time intercessors turning situations around through fasting and prayer
6429687 we can still do something we can stop the devil from taking advantage of the situation and make people think these are the end times
6429688 god is looking for effective and zealous intercessors that know that he wants them to pray so that their families communities nations and the world at large can be blessed through their outcry to god
6429689 everyone is a product of intercession and everyone must go back to being an intercessor
6429690 whatever your calling you are called to be a prayer warrior
6429691 we cant let the perfect be the enemy of the good
6429692 this drive is going to get me to a very nice place
6429693 please i like you but i dont want you in my garden
6429694 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
6429695 one suitable feedstock for this could be giant bamboo which has a high heating value and which has been developed in south africa
6429696 for the intermediate and longer term we should decentralise energy production and look at setting up agri villages entire villages are returning to providing their own food and energy needs with a farming system that allows them to grow the most efficient energy feed stocks such as bamboo sweet sorghum etc
6429697 these systems would help us to dispose of waste and address the electricity crisis
6429698 plants could be set up in every city within the next two to five years and would contribute to locally produced electricity
6429699 with all the developments above identified and acted upon the current energy crisis could be solved within four to five years in way that is green and as an added benefit create a whole new industry
6429700 my name is chloe saunders and my life will never be the same again
6429701 all i wanted was to make friends meet boys and keep on being ordinary i dont even know what that means anymore it all started on the day that i saw my first ghost and the ghost saw me
6429702 now there are ghosts everywhere and they wont leave me alone to top it all off i somehow got myself locked up in lyle house a special home for troubled teens yet the home isnt what it seems dont tell anyone but i think there might be more to my housemates than meets the eye the question is whose side are they on its up to me to figure out the dangerous secrets behind lyle house before its skeletons come back to haunt me
6429703 thats when i fired him but it had taken me two years to do it two years of agonizing over my decision only later did i learn that this same agent did the same thing to a far more prominent internationally bestselling author to the tune of millions of dollars so as a victim i was in good company
6429704 the first question describe yourself in a single word as you are right now second question describe the person you want to be the point these words are the beginning an end of the story what comes in between how do you get from where you are to where you want to be
6429705 this same rule applies to published writers they are not an exception
6429706 yes many booksellers like to support local authors but heres the thing keeping books on the shelves that do not sell uses valuable real estate for no gain which in bookseller terms means
6429707 dr mcnair talks about her literacy project newsletter and african american childrens literature

6429711 personally i trust our designers and their vision and love working with them on cover designs in some cases i have an idea of what i want the cover to look like but oftentimes ill wait and see what the designer comes up with first so as not to taint their creativity
6429712 most agents will jump on the opportunity to consider a proposal that is currently under consideration with a major house be wary though because
6429713 picture books can be used with reluctant readers and visual learners they can be paired with novels or nonfiction works in history lessons they can initiate art and design projects draw on art historical connections and critical thinking strategies and rekindle the personal experience with literature
6429714 the world that crissa jean chappell experiences is far from ordinary we hear cuban tree frogs she hears puppies barking we see a classroom with circular windows she sees a ship we smell an orchid she smells maple syrup eggs and bacon
6429715 hope feels so fragile sometimes in the publishing world whether an editor or agent likes your manuscript is so subjective they can be having a bad day when your query lands on their desk or in box or the subject matter might be something that turns them off or touches something they dont want to look at
6429716 i think this is a three way street an author shouldnt be expected to buy a gift for her author or her agent an agent shouldnt be expected to buy a gift for an author or an editor these are things we should do if we want to
6429717 then one day in the 1950s he met langston hughes in harlem he didnt look to me like a writer because he wasnt white remembers myers now 70 years old

6429720 the structure is so unusual that you need a dummy to refine and polish your text it can tell you which section of text is too long let you look at pacing of the story across the pages help you spot needless repetitions and much more
6429721 if you enter a contest and an editor requests your work or if you are a nonfiction author who has been approached by an editor go ahead and send the material otherwise if you really want an agent it might be wise to hold off

6429743 the investor class is buying back oil as a hedge because the value of the dollar is weak

6429815 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6429816 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6429817 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6429818 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6429819 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6429820 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6429821 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture us agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6429822 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6429823 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan

6429842 if we seek to understand american foreign policy in terms of a rational engagement with international problems or even as an effective means of projecting power we are looking in the wrong place the governments interests have always been provincial it seeks to appease lobbyists shift public opinion at crucial stages of the political cycle accommodate crazy christian fantasies and pander to television companies run by eccentric billionaires the us does not really have a foreign policy it has a series of domestic policies which it projects beyond its borders that they threaten the world with 57 varieties of destruction is of no concern to the current administration the only question of interest is who gets paid and what the political kickbacks will be

6429868 the first part of this course was very tricky but weve come out of it rather well prior to setting out from hong kong the most optimistic forecasts gave us 8 days to reach the sunda strait in the end we covered the 2 000 miles of this initial section in 6 days 16 hours its very satisfying particularly as the weather didnt really favour us dishing out what felt like some rather interminable days sailing close hauled and a rather long passage across the equator
6429869 the sely tradewinds are well and truly here weve got 22 to 25 knots of breeze which is enabling us to drive gitana 13 at speeds close to 25 30 knots the seas are building gradually and the atmosphere is wetter on deck now the sailors on watch have swapped their t shirts for foulies which are better suited to these new sailing conditions everything seems to be in place to enable us to pass the reunion islands at a steady pace some big surf awaits
6429870 the sely tradewinds are well established in the indian ocean these highly favourable winds will enable lionel lemonchois and his crew to maintain an average speed of around 25 knots throughout the first half of this ocean crossing this regular tradewind air flow is currently being produced by two vast zones of high pressure the first close to australia and the second close to africa these two systems are shifting slightly eastwards as they fill in and the second zone of high pressure will settle between the kerguelen and reunion islands and stretch right across the breadth of the indian ocean on saturday 23rd august a fine and slightly favourable ssely swell is accompanying the maxi catamaran so gitana 13 should make fairly rapid progress over the next four days following on from that theyll have to line themselves up nicely in order to negotiate several passages of fronts to the south of madagascar prior to reaching the cape of good hope the second half of the crossing wont be as direct and close hauled sailing will prevail once more in increasingly big seas as they approach the african continent

6429898 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6429899 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6429929 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6429930 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6429931 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6429932 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6429933 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6429934 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6429935 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6429936 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6429937 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6429938 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6429939 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6429940 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6429941 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6429942 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6429943 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6429944 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6429945 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6429954 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6429955 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6429956 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6429957 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6429958 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6429959 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6429960 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6429961 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6429962 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6429963 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6429964 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6429965 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6429966 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6429967 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6429968 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6429969 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6429970 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6429971 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6429972 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6429973 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6429974 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6429975 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6429976 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6429977 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6429978 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6429979 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6429980 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6429983 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6429984 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6429985 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6429986 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6429987 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6429988 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural

6429990 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6429991 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6429992 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6429993 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6429995 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6429996 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
