700000 we think the lobbying of politicians and the chancellor was helpful and i also believe that going into nationalisation saved the company
700001 however we can now look to the future it is important to focus on that from both a commercial and morale point of view
700002 one of the things we found out about northern rock was how much people in the region looked at it as though it was their business it is a big part of the north east
700003 it is part of the regional culture the regional mps recognised that was the case as much as the value of the company job losses had to be kept to a minimum
700004 i think the rest of the country did not quite realise how important it was to the region
700005 the case of northern rock has been overshadowed by what has come afterwards
700006 if the facts dont fit the theory change the facts
700007 im going to write a script next i do have an idea im always getting these mad ideas

700024 oh my sister said she let a friend borrow them
700025 what theyre not hers to give out how long ago
700026 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
700027 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
700028 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
700029 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
700030 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
700031 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
700032 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
700033 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
700034 la nueva estimaci n no representa un aumento real del n mero de nuevas infecciones sino que refleja nuestra capacidad para medir con mayor precisi n la incidencia del vih y garantizar una mejor comprensi n de la epidemia
700035 esta nueva imagen pone de manifiesto que el vih es y ha sido peor de lo que pens bamos anteriormente y pone de relieve los retos para enfrentar esta enfermedad
700036 llegar a todas las personas infectadas con el vih y aquellos en situaci n de riesgo con programas de prevenci n eficaces

700040 id be lying if i said i thought it would happen like it has here in the past year
700041 i was on the verge of not wanting to play here any more dealing with the fans and not winning i was like all right ill get through with my contract and ill see what happens but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
700042 but now were on the verge of something special we had a good year last year and this is definitely a football town and its turning back around this is a fun place to play when youre winning
700043 he would play this baseball video game and say you know dad your stuffs not very good
700044 he asked why are the yankees always so good every video game we get theyve got the best team i explained to him that they spend a lot of money on players if a player is really good they try to trade for him usually they have kind of an all star team
700045 about two months later i was signing autographs he said dead serious why would anyone want your autograph he said youre not any good youre just average
700046 i said ive been pitching in the big leagues about 10 years ive done this and that he said dad if you were any good the yankees would have traded for you

700050 the u m players always have said how much they enjoy heroes for kids and the strength and conditioning coach mike barwis said he wants to work with us on this next year

700053 i am working on a killer dive in training it has been going well but the coaches arent sure if we will use it in the competition we will have to wait and see
700054 its a complex dive there are a lot of things going on but it has been going well in training
700055 its all about getting a good technical start the start is the key and the hardest thing to pull off
700056 all the pieces are there for me to win another gold but it will come down to who is on their mental game on the day
700057 this will be my last olympic games and i have set myself the target of making it my best ever
700058 it was a dream for me in sydney it was my first games and i won a gold medal was just amazing
700059 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
700060 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organisation after he was done playing
700061 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
700062 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
700063 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
700064 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
700065 besides there are more important things going on like the upcoming presidential election get out and vote it would be great to see history made this time around like seeing americas first african american president go obama
700066 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
700067 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
700068 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
700069 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
700070 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
700071 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
700072 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
700073 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
700074 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it
700075 at the end of the day were talking about human rights
700076 and people should understand that human rights and peoples lives are in jeopardy were not talking about contracts here were not talking about money were talking about peoples lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract

700082 walks at the wrong time errors a lot of errors physical and mental errors a lot of opportunities for the opposition most of the time weve been scored upon first
700083 with so many young guys they need to hear it from a player
700084 its the hardest decision i ever had to make but also the easiest
700085 if its a spotlight thing you want it to be for a game winner or something like that you dont want it to be for a mistake you make the three of us thrive to be pretty quiet and not a lot to talk about which means were doing our job
700086 i had power which i hadnt had in previous years
700087 i never usually have touchbacks in week 17 i saw some good results from the workouts so i definitely stuck to it
700088 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
700089 it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
700090 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
700091 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
700092 when it was just wet everybodys deal went fine competitors and our stuff alike
700093 i think it was just making sure that the standing water was gone there were some areas that the drainage didnt keep up with the precipitation
700094 we have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
700095 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain
700096 i couldnt see 5 feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution
700097 when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
700098 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
700099 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
700100 i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it
700101 it felt really slow and the car was slipping around
700102 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept on the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important
700103 as old as they are theyre a little hard so there was zero grip out there
700104 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
700105 we just did the best we could with what we had to work with
700106 it was a learning experience nascar did what it had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
700107 well take the input from the teams that were there and see if theres something else that we could do that we dont know we needed to do
700108 valves survival horror game left 4 dead is coming to ps3 but ea will be taking on development duties in house
700109 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
700110 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform
700111 if you were doing a whole lot of simulation you can in theory get more performance out of the cell processor than out of the two other dual thread processors on the 360 but thats a big in theory
700112 the fact that blu ray won the format wars on there is a huge feather in sonys cap and then we wind up with cases like what were seeing right now where having all the extra space on the blu ray may be a useful thing for us above the fact that the hardwares not quite as good in terms of what it can do with the processing
700113 thats why any time that people make comments one way or the other about the consoles its easy to leave aside of the fact that its the best that its ever been in any generation in terms of support capabilities and all that
700114 were developing on the pc but we have 360 controllers on all the pcs
700115 what you can say really quite clearly and not get into too much argument about it is that the 360 is much easier to develop for its easier to get the performance out of it that it can deliver and the rasterizer the gpu side is generally faster than what the ps3 has
700116 you could design a game where the ps3 would be the superior platform but youd have to go out of your way to do it if youre doing a game like people just want to do games now the 360s the better platform

700144 if its what it takes to get her back engaged in school then thats great its really really good

700146 theres an informal conference held at the school where some of the agencies get together along with the school and discuss what the issues are
700147 we dont want to prosecute parents for not having their kids at school but we also want them to buy in to the process to get their kids ultimately re engaged back in to school
700148 shes not a bad kid its just she hadnt been turning up to school

700166 la reestructuraci n de pdvsa busca adecuarla a los acuerdos con las transnacionales en el marco de las empresas mixtas
700167 la reestructuraci n de nuestra principal industria anunciada por el gobierno por boca del ministro presidente de pdvsa apunta a colocar a la empresa a tono con las pol ticas de acuerdos con transnacionales mediante la f rmula de empresas mixtas que lesionan gravemente la soberan a del pa s
700168 sin duda que pdvsa necesita una reestructuraci n profunda para ponerla realmente a tono con el proceso revolucionario y con los intereses de sus trabajadores y el pueblo venezolano es falso que pdvsa sea del pueblo como dice el slogan gubernamental por el contrario hoy la principal fuente de recursos con que cuenta el pa s se encuentra dirigida por una tecnoburocracia que se viste de rojo rojito pero que todos los d as humilla a los trabajadores abusa del poder y desoye los reclamos laborales una burocracia que repite los viejos m todos del pasado puntofijista que utiliza para su provecho los bienes de la empresa que ha convertido el ingreso a pdvsa en un privilegio de familia tal como hac an los gerentes y merit cratas de la iv rep blica hoy nuestra principal industria es dirigida por una caterva de sinverg enzas e incapaces que est n haciendo ca da y mesa limpia con los recursos de todo el pueblo creando una situaci n de alto riesgo debido al deterioro de las condiciones de higiene y seguridad industrial
700169 la propuesta de reestructuraci n de pdvsa que el gobierno est planteando es un tema de much sima importancia que debe ser conocido y abordado en profundidad por los trabajadores petroleros y por todos los venezolanos por la gran importancia que tiene el tema petrolero para la econom a del pa s una reestructuraci n del modelo de gesti n de pdvsa es un asunto estrat gico que no puede quedar en manos exclusivamente de un peque o sanedr n de 7 supercomisionados mucho menos si esta comisi n es nombrada por la misma tecnoburocracia roja rojita que desatiende los reclamos de los trabajadores y lleva al descalabro a nuestra m s importante empresa eso ser a como poner a un zamuro a cuidar carne por otra parte desde mi punto de vista queda claro que no se trata de modificar la gesti n interna de la empresa a favor de los trabajadores por el contrario lo que se busca es adecuar pdvsa a los acuerdos con el empresariado y con las transnacionales que hoy se benefician de las llamadas empresas mixtas esta reestructuraci n debe ser vista en el marco del acto del pasado 11 de junio con la alta burgues a nacional tambi n debe ser considerada en el contexto de las afirmaciones recientemente formuladas por el ministro ram rez a una revista chilena en las que tild a los trabajadores venezolanos de conservadores y privilegiados o por el cuestionamiento que en d as pasados hizo el presidente ch vez al contrato de los trabajadores de vtv declaraciones en las que ofendi la dignidad de un humilde camar grafo de esa empresa
700170 la reestructuraci n que se est proponiendo persigue colocar de forma m s clara el conjunto de la gesti n y la organizaci n interna de pdvsa al servicio de los acuerdos de empresas mixtas con las transnacionales entre otras cosas busca disminuir el papel de los sindicatos y limitar el derecho a la contrataci n colectiva en aras de la paz social entre trabajadores y patronos por ello las mesas de di logo que fueron una conquista arrancada a la gerencia con la lucha y la movilizaci n de los trabajadores para tratar de resolver sus principales problemas ahora el gobierno las reivindica como suyas y trata de utilizarlas para sustituir a las organizaciones sindicales incluso poniendo en riesgo el derecho a la contrataci n colectiva ya que se pretender a eliminarlo progresivamente y que sea en las mesas de di logo o por normativa interna donde se establecer an las reivindicaciones de los trabajadores y esto no lo decimos en abstracto ya el presidente ch vez cuestion el contrato colectivo de una empresa estatal como vtv lo que significa una violaci n a la autonom a de los sindicatos y un cuestionamiento directo al derecho de los trabajadores a negociar de forma independiente del patrono en este caso el gobierno sus condiciones de trabajo
700171 esto que decimos se puede apreciar con toda nitidez actualmente en el proceso para elegir a la directiva de la futpv en el que el gobierno y la gerencia de pdvsa intervienen de forma grosera pasando por encima de los trabajadores y de la autonom a sindical tratando desesperadamente de unir a por lo menos cuatro sectores de la burocracia roja rojita que hoy se encuentran divididos en torno a prebendas y privilegios que nada tienen que ver con las necesidades de los trabajadores
700172 y por otra parte cuando o mos al ministro ram rez hablar de reestructuraci n de pdvsa no podemos dejar de pensar que muy probablemente ese nuevo modelo de gesti n en pdvsa tendr a como objetivo terminar con los supuestos y fantasiosos privilegios que tienen los trabajadores conservadores y acr ticos venezolanos entre ellos el derecho a contratar libremente y a organizarse sindicalmente de forma independiente y aut noma

700210 if youre keeping score at home so far our war in iraq has created a police state in that country and socialism in spain so no democracies yet but were really getting close
700211 the congress of the united states has always been an institution that has been mockable
700212 well in the house of representatives we have sent that bill over and over again to the senate with it hitting a brick wall over there but i do feel good about the things we have done other than that but
700213 so on the war you think congress has dropped the ball
700214 not the house of representatives in the house we have sent a timeline a goal whatever we thought they could accept pass and send to the president
700215 why cant the house of representatives put a little bit of pressure on the senate in the hierarchy of balance of power are you the little sibling
700216 no the speaker has awesome power for our house but its a bicameral legislature and in the senate a simple majority doesnt matter 60 votes are not
700217 but we had harry reid over here senator harry reid came on the program and sat across from me can i tell you something it was crazy six minute interview he was asleep for four of the minutes he left and i just kept asking questions to the chair
700218 ive never seen anything like it was he is he is he just sad or what happened cant you put more pressure on him more publicly are there ways
700219 no its not him its the sixty you need sixty votes so he gets the democratic votes and that is a majority but you still need nine more votes that is why this election is so important i mean the the idea we we have been able to accomplish a lot we passed our energy bill the minimum wage first time in ten years
700220 couldnt you take stronger uh in terms of the war
700221 well we did that we did that this last time and we sent the bill over with no funding and conditions for how we would stay there the bill came back from the senate with the funding and no conditions on how we stay there we need
700222 we do need a new president i would say that let me ask you this
700223 our election in 86 we thought the president would listen to the will of the american people it was very clear they wanted an end to the war
700224 2006 now that was step one 2008 we get a democratic president we bring the war to an end and return to a position of leadership in the world
700225 is congress as it is made up today obsolete is is with a powerful president is congress a sort of a vestigial unless it has 60 votes in the senate and a huge majority in the house of representatives
700226 will you exercise that type lets say barack obama is fortunate enough to win the presidency
700227 or or i dont want to play favorites here or hillary clinton lets say that either one of them is fortunate enough to do that are you saying that the democrats will exercise more and more stringent oversight over a democratic president than the republican congress did over president bush
700228 no rubber stamp and in terms of the in terms of the for example domestic surveillance no president democrat or republican should have the power that this president unintelligible so it isnt and the congress of the united states has to assert its prerogatives and this republican congress has been a rubber stamp
700229 he told me on the way home the most important thing in my life are my sons
700230 he was a wonderful son and a wonderful father im so sorry this had to happen
700231 there was just a disagreement and things got out of hand
700232 i think david was just trying to scare him and something happened that wasnt supposed to happen i dont think he meant to do this

700256 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
700257 the international community is being watched not only by iran but also by irans neighbors and when the international community shows hesitation this is being perceived as weakness
700258 we live in a neighborhood in which whether you beat the bully or join it
700259 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table this is what we need to do today

700270 its not threatening any structures over night it got within about 500 meters of a trailer but there was a swamp between the structure and the blaze and crews hit that area really hard to keep the trailer safe it is not near any structures right now
700271 it was originally burning on some bad ground on a hill that was very hard to access and fight on crews worked overnight to bring it down off the hill to an area they can access better
700272 it has grown from when it was reported first saturday night it started off as about 10 hectares and is now around 30 however instead of having to fight it on bad ground by bringing it to us we can get our heavy equipment on it a lot easier
700273 we have a fresh crew on it this morning including two helicopters we will likely be ordering in another crew later today we dont have an estimate on to how much of the blaze is contained but we are making good progress
700274 at this point if we get high winds that could be a concern because the area is so dry the entire south okanagan hasnt had much rainfall lately

700280 thats the key thing stir up that fire make sure its good and cold because unfortunately we are still finding a number of campfires out there that are not being attended or people have left the site and the fires are still warm or hot in some cases
700281 sometime this rain although it can be a blessing for the fire hazard it also can be a curse because it gives folks a false sense of security while we did get some rain we are still at a high hazard and with just a little bit of sunny weather we can bounce back quickly from that moisture so we need people to remember we are still at a high hazard and there still is potential for fires to spread out there

700362 i have lived on pine grove for 18 years and the reason i moved here was because it is a lovely tree lined street
700363 this issue came up a few years ago and the council took the time to talk to us about the plans and they listened to our views
700364 we accept that some of the trees need pruning and some need chopping down because they are diseased or dying but we told the council they should replace them with new trees to preserve the character of the street there are no plans to do that
700365 this time we have been given a letter on thursday telling us that they are going to start removing the trees on monday that gave us only one working day to speak to people on the street and contact the council
700366 the footpaths can be uneven but we accept that because we are living on a nice tree lined street
700367 i could not believe it when i was given the letter on thursday the engineer i spoke to claimed that most of the residents support the scheme but most of the people i have spoken to are opposed to it
700368 following reports carried out by two arboriculturists one salford city council and one independent employed by residents it has been determined that a proportion of the trees are in a dangerously poor condition and require removal there were also some trees that would become unstable when the roots were pruned
700369 but salford councils urban vision highway services has decided the footpaths on pine grove have become uneven and dangerous because of the tree roots and should be cleared to make way for footway reconstruction

700468 eran grandes e incluso circulares pero no pude ver ning n detalle ya que estaban bastante lejos

700470 ven an hacia nosotros hab a unos 20 es dif cil decir qu tan alto o qu tan r pido iban pero era a un ritmo constante
700471 yo no hab a visto nada como esto antes yo pens qu es esto un ovni y a continuaci n me pate el sentido com n
700472 no pienso que nadie de nosotros creyera que era un ovni y alguien debi haber estado lanz ndolos
700473 yo estaba tan interesado en leer los informes de otras personas y me di cuenta que estaba viendo la misma cosa
700474 wow me siento todav a tembloroso me parece tener un sentido real de urgencia e inter s para comprender qu eran estas cosas
700475 hemos visto asombrados al menos 20 o tal vez 30 luces de color naranja en silencio pero flotando a prop sito a trav s del cielo
700476 nuestras conjeturas sobre lo que pueden ser incluyen globos de aire caliente planeadores y ultraligeros pero simplemente parec an estar demasiado alto y viajar demasiado r pido para serlo
700477 los primeros cinco estaban en una formaci n v y las luces en una de las parejas de atr s se apagaron y no pudimos verlas m s sin importar cu nto tensamos nuestros ojos
700478 empez a frenar por encima de nosotros y no estaba tan alta al menos no lo parec a
700479 a medida que empez a moverse sobre la casa mi marido entr por su c mara mi hija y yo fuimos a la puerta y de repente esta cosa comenz a moverse
700480 se subi a unos 40 grados y se fue directo hacia el cielo muy r pido todav a hab a bastante luz y se pudo ver el color naranja que se estaba reduciendo antes de que desapareciera entre las estrellas
700481 incluso ahora lo que todos presenciamos es tan dif cil de creer que no podemos dejar de pensar y hablar sobre ello
700482 si alguien me hubiera dicho lo mismo probablemente yo no le habr a cre do
700483 pero ya que hab a cuatro adultos perfectamente sobrios me permito a adir y dos nietos adolescentes que vieron el final de lo mismo no podemos dejarlo pasar
700484 mis perros ladran como locos a todo lo que vuela sobre la casa pero no hicieron ning n ruido
700485 no soy una persona que cree en los extraterrestres pero estoy absolutamente at nito por lo que vi
700486 el color era incre ble hab a un resplandor anaranjado a su alrededor como la llama de un fuego el ctrico nunca he visto nada igual

700576 if i were in canada i would be hopping mad about the lack of ability to crack down on these corrupt people who are involved in this trade and on the farmers who are growing the opium
700577 they are clearly financing the people who are attacking your troops attacking the british troops in helmand province and attacking the americans throughout as well
700578 his power base is in helmand and kandahar provinces thats where 70 to 80 per cent of the opium is grown and he does not want to crack down on the people there because he needs their support for re election
700579 look we cannot support your government anymore if youre protecting narco traffickers
700580 you karzai need to hit the trade at all levels
700581 we all agree with the fundamental need to deal with the problem
700582 i know that canada is prepared to set up and be part of the solution does it necessarily mean going out and burning crops or whatever the latest technique is im not sure about that
700583 it may well be better to focus on interdiction to break down the downstream supply chain that creates the value as opposed to alienating the farmers whose support you ultimately need as you build democracy in afghanistan

700691 we thought of this as our way of protecting those at greatest risk as more information develops about jalape os

700693 the accumulated data from all investigations indicate that jalape o peppers caused some illnesses but that they do not explain all illnesses
700694 our data give evidence for the first time for a strong paternal effect on iui intrauterine insemination outcome either on pregnancy rates but also on miscarriage rates
700695 we have known there was a paternal effect for a while but we didnt expect to find these kind of miscarriage rates
700696 until now gynaecologists only focused on maternal age and the message was to get pregnant before the age of 35 or 38 because afterwards it would be difficult
700697 but now the gynaecologists must also focus on paternal age and give this information to the couple
700698 it enabled me to see how much of an impact it made with even just a slight change in your diet such as having a bowl of ice cream or a fast food cheeseburger
700699 illnesses were linked to consumption of an item containing fresh tomatoes and fresh jalpeno peppers
700700 illnesses were linked to an item containing fresh jalapeno peppers and no other suspect item
700701 caused some illnesses but that they do not explain all illnesses
700702 at this time the fda is advising people in high risk populations such as elderly persons infants and people with impaired immune systems to avoid eating raw jalapeno and raw serrano peppers

700758 while there is plenty to be critical about in terms of the democratic party leadership we would not want people to see this as an anti democratic party protest
700759 the american people voted to restore integrity and honesty in washington d c
700760 if you fall into the orientation of trying to make the democrats be what they are not and never will be you will end up becoming more like what the democrats actually
700761 agreed that obama is part of the system and i agree we need revolution but unless that is around the corner we have to be realistic and support obama
700762 the bad news is well have summers like phoenix but with humidity

700766 which fast is the most meritorious after the fasts of ramadan
700767 messenger of allah i have seen you fasting in the month of shaban so frequently that i have never seen you fasting in any other month
700768 that shaban is a month between rajab and ramadan which is neglected by many people and it is a month in which an account of the deeds of human beings is presented before the lord of the universe so i wish that my deeds be presented at a time when i am in a state of fasting
700769 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam used to fast the whole of shaban i said to him messenger of allah is shaban your most favorite month for fasting he said in this month allah prescribes the list of the persons dying this year therefore i like that my death comes when i am in a state of fasting
700770 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam would sometimes begin to fast continuously until we thought he would not stop fasting and sometimes he used to stop fasting until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting a complete month except the month of ramadan and i have never seen him fasting in a month more frequently than he did in shaban
700771 i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting in a month so profusely as he did in the month of shaban he used to fast in that month leaving only a few days rather he used to fast almost the whole of the month
700772 i have never seen the messenger of allah fasting for two months continuously except in the months of shaban and ramadan
700773 do not fast after the first half of the month of shaban is gone
700774 do not precede the month of ramadan with one or two fasts
700775 once prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam performed the salah of the night tahajjud and made a very long sajdah until i feared that he had passed away
700776 allah almighty descends in a manner he best knows it in the night occurring in the middle of shaban and forgives a large number of people more than the number of the fibers on the sheep of the tribe kalb
700777 this is the middle night of shaban allah frees in it a large number of the people from fire more than the number of the hair growing on the sheep of the tribe kalb but he does not even look at a person who associates partners with allah or at a person who nourishes malice in his heart against someone or at a person who cuts off the ties of kinship or at a man who leaves his clothes extending beyond his ankles as a sign of pride or at a person who disobeys his parents or at a person who has a habit of drinking wine
700778 allah almighty looks upon all those created by him in the middle night of shaban and forgives all those created by him except the one who associates partners with him or the one who has malice in his heart against a muslim

700788 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on

700790 i cant imagine him being involved in a scheme to make money or to make a profit especially one that would put people at risk or even die
700791 thats not the bruce we knew he was sweet friendly i mean he was into grass recycling
700792 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
700793 he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
700794 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him

700828 by 1945 the american oss dedicated to supporting guerrilla warfare and resistance organization and the office of war information owi which disseminated us propaganda were developing independent contacts inside northern indochina as a result the oss increasingly endorsed the one truly effective resistance movement ho chi minhs viet minh coalition
700829 ho wanted american technical experts to help establish those few industries that viet nam was capable of supporting
700830 the french have fled the japanese have capitulated emperor bao dai has abdicated our people have broken the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for our nation for these reasons we members of the provisional government representing the whole of the vietnamese people declare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with france we repeal all international obligations that france has so far subscribed to on our behalf and we abolish all the special rights the french have unlawfully acquired in our territory we are convinced that the allied nations which at tehran and san francisco acknowledged the principles of self determination and equality of nations will not refuse to acknowledge the independence of viet nam for these reasons we members of the provisional government of the democratic republic of viet nam solemnly declare to the world that viet nam has the right to be a free and independent country and in fact it is so already the entire vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their spiritual and material forces to sacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their right to liberty and independence
700831 had filed a report on the deepening crisis in viet nam stating his opinion that the u
700832 actually the u s involvement in what later became known as the viet nam war began on the very day of the japanese surrender september 2 1945
700833 would take land anywhere in the world even if it were only a rock or a sandbar
700834 if all of that new material was being returned to the states
700835 in 1945 none of us had any idea that the first battles of the cold war were going to be fought by u s military units in those two regions beginning in 1950 and 1965 yet that is precisely what had been planned and it is precisely what happened who made that decision back in 1943 1945
700836 once in haiphong harbor this enormous shipment of arms was transferred under the direction of u s army major general gallagher who was supporting the oss and his associate ho chi minh gallagher had come from china to mop up the remnants of the defeated japanese army hos military commander colonel giap quickly moved this equipment into hiding until the day when it would be needed by 1954 that time had come
700837 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war with iran
700838 the one plan that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the strait of hormuz start a shoot up
700839 might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation
700840 look is it high school yeah are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
700841 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
700842 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
700843 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
700844 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
700845 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
700846 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic

700850 b c is trying to position itself in both camps its an inconsistency
700851 i think they the government hope that the people understand that politics is about making hard choices and sometimes one is forced to make choices that arent necessarily consistent with each other
700852 if we do get details of the cap and trade component alongside the carbon tax i think people will be prepared to live with the seeming contradictions
700853 we need to be talking to those industries we need to be talking about what they can do to deal with emissions issues and begin to address that while of course still trying to keep the economy buoyant
700854 theres got to be a discussion and it should be a public discussion where british columbians understand what the implications of this are
700855 its about finding the most cost effective and economically viable ways of reducing the carbon imprint that we all have across the system
700856 we have to move into the new century and into the new framework that asks us to think about our resources not waste them be thrifty with them use them to the maximum ability that we can
700857 day of hell for two young danes dressed as muslim women
700858 i was shocked at the numerous disgraceful comments and the huge wall of hostility we were confronted by when we were walking on the street people went beyond all the norms of respect and good behaviour
700859 it was shocking to see people behaving in such a shameful way it was worse than i had imagined i wanted to go straight home and change confronting so much hatred was unbearable
700860 our theory is that they are frightened by things which are unknown to them surveys show that 80 percent of danes have had no personal contact with ethnic minorities
700861 the experience on the bus shows that hostility and the creation of enemies are things which learned not something people are born with
700862 be just even if it is against your next of kin
700863 let not your hatred of some people induce you to be unjust be just that is nearer to piety

700875 perhaps the only thing more outrageous than exxonmobil making record profits while americans are paying record prices at the pump is the fact that senator mccain has proposed giving them an additional 1 2 billion tax break
700876 this bill will help michigan homeowners and communities avoid further foreclosures eliminate blight and create jobs
700877 these new tools will help protect our families from losing their homes in this tough economy
700878 a great idea thats born at the university of michigan that we want to turn into a good business the venture capitalists on coasts will come knocking and say we want you to move we want to keep those businesses here
700879 both of those are obviously well above the 8 percent rate of return which is sort of the watermark youre looking for
700880 the expectation is that the potential rates of return are generally speaking very good
700881 but were starting to build momentum and this is another great tool that we can use to bring to bear to sell michigan
700882 and with the expertise they have and how can they link us to other opportunities its a great retention tool

700910 the human spirit rejoices in single handedly outsmarting the state police
700911 from such ambiguous sentences how deformed the thoughts and actions of someone can become who for years has used their mother tongue for hiding thoughts rather than for expressing them

700933 its not fair its not right and i do not know a single redeeming value that wal mart is going to bring to our village
700934 given basker s estimates it is probably no surprise that the current slowdown is good news for wal mart but bad news for target
700935 to me wal mart is the epitome of everything that is bad in our country right now outsourcing of jobs to china low quality dangerous goods putting mom and pop stores out of business and making the entire country look like a homogenized genericana wasteland
700936 walmart is actively evil eviscerating middle class family stores evil workers rights violations shoddy pay dangerous products made for the poor ironically made by the poor of the third world evil they make a profit off of screwing people over

700973 more impoverished today than americans were in the 19th century
700974 i cannot describe to you what it is like to see a dead american soldier
700975 looking at photographs of the gravely wounded or dead is a profoundly affecting and emotional experience
700976 however i do feel that it is my duty as a journalist to see that a truthful account of the consequences of war is given
700977 it eased our minds a whole lot we would be less without it than we are
700978 but the first time i looked at it it would have killed me
700979 death and carnage are not the whole story of war there is also heroism and frustration success and setback camaraderie and on occasion atrocity but death and carnage are part of the story and to launder them out of our account of the war would be a disservice
700980 however i do feel that it is my duty as a journalist to see that a truthful account of the consequences of war is given
700981 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
700982 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
700983 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less
700984 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
700985 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home

700989 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
700990 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
700991 that a countrys desirability to visit was in inverse proportion to the welcome at border controls
700992 a lot of people were confined in a small area
700993 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
700994 elle tait lisse et fine comme une esquisse une femme pas assez dessin e la chair pas assez pleine
700995 cette effroyable limite entre le don et la m fiance entre la licence et la pr caution
700996 now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
700997 i think it takes away what obama considers to be an issue that works in his favor and also puts the focus more on the economy and energy prices where he wants to increase taxes during a recession and doesnt really have a plan to bring us to energy independence
700998 the more success we have in iraq and the more that casualties are down and the more troops were able to bring home the more it is a vindication of the surge strategy advocated by john mccain
700999 build sharply defined personalities for their brands and stick to those personalities year after year

701004 s c stata la nascita del mio secondo bambino una cosa bellissima da vedere e alla quale assistere poi arrivato questo prolungamento del contratto ormai linter la mia famiglia e sono molto contento di tutto questo
701005 compiere un sogno desidero chiudere la carriera qui mi auguro e spero possa essere cos non mi vedo proprio a indossare unaltra maglia e la mia famiglia qui si trova come fosse a casa linter mi ha aperto le porte quando ero uno sconosciuto sono arrivato a ventanni ed ero un giocatore tutto da scoprire per me era una sfida e la societ ha sempre avuto fiducia nei miei confronti soprattutto nei momenti di difficolt la squadra e la societ hanno sempre creduto nel lavoro e questa cosa finalmente sta pagando
701006 se il fisico lo permette si pu continuare limportante rendersi conto di essere utile per la squadra
701007 speriamo ci auguriamo tutti i successi possibili con gli sforzi che il presidente e la societ hanno fatto ripeto moratti merita un successo cos importante dopo tutto quello che ha fatto per far diventare linter una squadra forte lui sarebbe luomo pi felice di tutti se alzassimo quel trofeo
701008 credo che tutto dipenda dalla costanza dal lavoro e dal crederci sempre il dna dellinter deve essere questo per sempre
701009 inutile fare paragoni ora mancini ha vinto tantissimo con noi adesso arrivato mourinho che un tecnico molto capace e intelligente ha concetti chiari per la squadra stiamo lavorando duramente per arrivare agli appuntamenti che contano nel migliore dei modi la sua mano si sta gi vedendo
701010 credo che altre squadre si siano molto rinforzate ma noi rimaniamo un organico molto competitivo che lotter per tutti gli obiettivi che abbiamo a disposizione
701011 il milan ha fatto un acquisto importante ronaldinho un grande campione uno di quei giocatori che possono risolvere una partita in ogni momento la juventus una squadra molto tosta e vuole tornare ad alti livelli la roma vorr continuare il lavoro che sta facendo da alcuni anni la fiorentina ha un organico completo e un tecnico intelligente e vorr certamente dire la sua poi ci siamo noi che vogliamo difendere a tutti i costi lo scudetto sar un campionato bello ed equilibrato
701012 non contano solo per questo contano per preparare bene la supercoppa e arrivare al campionato nel migliore dei modi ci aspettano tre gare di altissimo livello questo ci permetter di arrivare alla giusta condizione e nel modo migliore
701013 il bayern monaco una squadra sempre difficile e tosta da battere iniziano il campionato settimana prossima e sono pi avanti di noi nella preparazione sar un test importante
701014 io metto sempre davanti il gruppo credo che i soccessi importanti arrivino sempre grazie a tutti
701015 su ibra speriamo che non abbia pi problemi e possa essere al cento per cento con noi e a dispsosizione del tecnico per affrontare questa stagione che sar molto dura per adri una specie di rivincita sua lo vedo con tanta voglia di dimostrare tutto il suo valore e di tornare il giocatore che tutti conosciamo me lo auguro perch un ragazzo per bene
701016 mi piacerebbe farne di pi ma se qualcuno mi dicesse che segno un solo gol cos importante e noi rivinciamo lo scudetto allora andr comunque bene
701017 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
701018 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
701019 hey man thought you might be interested in this ive been diggin around the local reggae scene and figuring out all the roots and origins and came up with this old dude from the south this song here is massive now as reggae and ska are catching on here this song in particular just caught on after 4 5 years of being only for the heads you wont understand obviously but its about a girl who left this guy and and hes moaning about how he didnt care that she took all his shit when she left but how could she take his bob marley cd collection and bag of weed when i first heard it i blew it off as a silly thai song but somehow its really grown on me his album is really good too

701072 theyre a very good side and theyve proven that to come third the first year they went to sydney in 2006 is a great achievement they combine well as a team and they are a credit to themselves and their school
701073 we began planning immediately after the previous show and that has paid dividends our focus was on getting people through the door and encouraging them to buy to support local artists and in turn boost the reach of our youth projects
701074 we had lots of people standing around and reading the information on it
701075 we also had mixed feelings from the club members about whether it should have been there or not but it generated some interest and it might have even got a few extra people through the doors
701076 i have been in negotiation with the owners of these commercial properties for at least three years
701077 now that we have negotiated to buy these properties we can start planning the third stage of the development and lodge an application with council in the future

701086 i was on the beach and saw someone trying to bring the guy in on a longboard

701161 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
701162 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
701163 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
701164 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff

701168 it is hypocritical to a point if bet just didnt do it as black that would be one thing but if youre going to showcase one gangster then showcase them all why is bet only stopping at the black gangster do only black gangsters go to prison

701181 i urge congressman rohrabacher to stand up against limiting womens access to birth control

701390 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbours
701391 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent

701394 its likely they will be the three appearances by the candidates this fall
701395 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
701396 obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
701397 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done

701428 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
701429 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics

701465 i think it is said that the archbishop of canterbury has placed himself so far on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the gospel on this issue
701466 anyone who thinks we will come to a definitive conclusion overnight doesnt understand the church in general and the anglican communion in particular

701485 violence reached a crescendo against the indian after the civil war and found a yet bloodier manifestation during the protracted conquest of the philippines from 1898 until well into the next decade when anywhere from 200 000 to 600 000 filipinos were killed in an orgy of racist slaughter that evoked much congratulation and approval

701505 how can such nice people meaning the anonymous members of the abu sayyaf at times do such horrible things

701511 like marcos schemes arroyos strategy to defeat the broad opposition to her regime intersects with the long standing counterinsurgency campaign being launched by her government in coordination with the us as the philippine equivalent of the war on terror
701512 a government that cannot protect citizens from lawless killings regardless of who are behind them loses the legitimacy to continue to govern
701513 in most situations the isolated killing of individuals will constitute a simple crime and not give rise to any governmental responsibility but once a pattern becomes clear and in the case of the philippines the pattern has been recognized by amnesty international governmental bodies church groups and so on in which the response of the government is clearly inadequate its responsibility under international human rights law becomes applicable through its inaction the government confers a degree of impunity upon the killers
701514 arrogance of us military forces all over the world for vicious crimes like rape but ultimately their impunity for international crimes against humanity the us does this not only by refusing to be bound or by ignoring international humanitarian law and useful mechanisms like the international criminal court but also foisting self serving bilateral agreements or twisting them to suit its purposes of worldwide political economic and military supremacy

701583 it is very possible that that there are causes better than those i have embraced but my cause is good and that is enough for me other causes will undoubtedly bring more profit more renown more honors more glories but the bamboo in growing on this soil comes to sustain nipa huts and not the heavy weights of european edifices as to honor fame or profit that i might have reaped i agree that all of this is tempting especially to a young man of flesh and bone like myself with so many weaknesses like anybody else but as nobody chooses the nationality nor the race to which he is born and as at birth the privileges or the disadvantages inherent in both are found already created i accept the cause of my country in the confidence that he who has made me a filipino will forgive the mistakes i may commit in view of our difficult situation and the defective education that we receive from the time we are born besides i do not aspire to eternal fame or renown i do not aspire to equal others whose conditions faculties and circumstances may be and are in reality different from mine my only desire is to do what is possible what is within my power what is most necessary i have glimpsed a little light and i believe i ought to show it to my countrymen without liberty an idea that is somewhat independent might be provocative and another that is affectionate might be considered as baseness or flattery and i can neither be provocative nor base nor a flatterer in order to speak luminously of politics and produce results it is necessary in my opinion to have ample liberty

701586 i visited the largest cities of america with their big buildings electric lights and magnificent conceptions undoubtedly america is a great country but it still has many defects there is no real civil liberty in some states the negro cannot marry a white woman nor a negress a white man because of their hatred for the chinese other asiatics like the japanese being confused with them are likewise disliked by the ignorant americans the customs are excessively strict however as they say rightly american offers a home too for the poor who like to work there was moreover much arbitrariness for example when we were in quarantine they placed us under quarantine in spite of the clearance given by the american consul of not having had a single case of illness aboard and of the telegram of the governor of hong kong declaring that port free from epidemic we were quarantined because there were on board 800 chinese and as elections were being held in san francisco the government wanted to boast that it was taking strict measures against the chinese to win votes and the peoples sympathy we were informed of the quarantine verbally without specific duration however on the same day of our arrival they unloaded 700 bales of silk without fumigating them the ships doctor went ashore many customs employees and an american doctor from the hospital for cholera victims came on board thus we were quarantined for about thirteen days afterwards passengers of the first class were allowed to land the japanese and chinese in the 2nd and 3rd classes remained in quarantine for an indefinite period it is thus in that way they got rid of about 200 actually 643 coolies according to zaide chinese letting them gradually off board

701635 at present the russian military is considering the possibility of establishing so called jump up bases in various regions of the world to provide refueling and maintenance support for the patrolling bombers
701636 would practically erase the time constraints for the russian bombers and make their presence near the u s borders almost permanent

701705 columnist bob herbert is right about mccains campaign trying to smear obama and running to a degree at least a negative campaign when reports surfaced that obama did not visit united states troops in germany allegedly because reporters were not going to accompany him on the trip the mccain campaign instantly responded portraying obama as a man who does not care about the troops and who only supports them when doing so is politically convenient that is nasty but it is not more nasty than what barack obama and his staffers are doing to john mccain they too are smearing they too are running a negative campaign they too try to make mccain look as bad as possible it is all part of the game there is one reason for the above politics they run negative campaigns because it works
701706 what does not have anything to do with the criticism and attacks leveled at obama however is his skin color it seems that liberals activists although especially african americans have trouble differentiating racism from politics as usual and even from normal fair criticism there is literally no reason to assume that mccain is running a racist campaign in fact in todays day in sic age running a racist campaign would be disastrous common sense dictates that one may have won elections back in the 1960s on such a racist platform but not in 2008 in 2008 polls show that americans are more likely to vote for a black man than for a woman they also show that mccain has more trouble convincing americans to vote for him because of his age than obama has because of his race additionally americans not only seem to have broken with the racist past of their country they even vehemently oppose racism of any kind sure there is still racism here and there and especially prejudices are alive and well but using racism for political purposes will only result in one losing elections

701711 when the cos made his renowned comments in 2004 suggesting that some he didnt say all and didnt mean all poor black folks could do more to help improve their own condition a number of black columnists took bill to task they were really mad at him one of them was eugene kane a columnist for the milwaukee journal sentinel kane and i are members of the trotter group an organization of black columnists named for the civil rights activist and columnist who gave president wilson headaches and no were not related at least we dont think we are kane wrote a scathing column about the cos remarks when bill visited milwaukee for the first of one of his many town meetings he made it a point to call kane and invite him to the meeting kane attended from what kane told me the two spent quite some time together in milwaukee as if they were old buddies i on the other hand had bills back from the old get go i said that no 1 the cos was right and that no 2 hed only said what i and other black conservatives had been saying for years bill came to baltimore for one of those town meetings i didnt get an invitation then didnt get a call didnt get a call or invitation this time either the cos went out of his way to butter up and try to appease black columnists who dissed him and gave the back of his hand to the ones who supported him
701712 believe me they were really ticked at the cos but as i sat there listening to the tar and feather cosby now tirade several thoughts occurred to me one was that nearly 70 percent of black households are fatherless another was that the cos aint the daddy of any children who live in those households supreme court justice clarence thomas numero uno on the list of black guys black folks are mad at isnt the daddy of any of those kids either is it possible that maybe just maybe if some of that black anger were directed at those missing daddies then maybe thered be more of them in the home im thoroughly convinced that if black americans would channel the anger weve wasted for the last 17 years on thomas and the last four on the cos at black criminals thered be crime free black communities throughout the land so while i should be angry with bill i wont be theres enough misplaced anger among black americans as it is if im going to be mad at somebody black believe me itll be somebody worth the rise in blood pressure like those poster kids for retroactive abortion who raped a haitian woman in west palm beach fla and then committed other acts this paper cant and wont print no i aint mad at bill but he really needs to holler at a brother sometime
701713 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
701714 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection

701716 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
701717 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed

701958 het is weliswaar niet voorspeld maar er lijkt toch een storm op te steken en geen kleine ook

701978 comcast was delaying subscribers downloads and gt blocking their uploads

701980 today the commission tells comcast to stop and to gt disclose to its subscribers how it is going to manage gt traffic on a going forward basis we therefore take gt another important step to ensure that all consumers have gt unfettered access to the internet
701981 we are disappointed in the commissions divided gt conclusion because we believe that our network gt management choices were reasonable wholly consistent gt with industry practices and that we did not block access gt to web sites or online applications including peer to gt peer services
701982 the commission gt did not intend for the internet policy statement to gt serve as rules
701983 commissions order raises gt significant due process concerns and a variety of gt substantive legal questions we are considering all our gt legal options and are disappointed that the commission gt rejected our attempts to settle this issue without gt further delays
701984 the fccs bipartisan decision to punish comcast is a gt major victory
701985 todays order makes it gt clear that there is nothing reasonable about restricting gt access to online content or technologies moving gt forward this bellwether case will send a strong signal gt to cable and phone companies that such violations will gt not be tolerated

702006 to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie

702051 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
702052 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
702053 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
702054 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
702055 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
702056 careful we may reinforce the stereotypes if we campaign for obama
702057 the character in this movie is a harvard student hes bright he reads books i could never be believable as that smart young guy

702062 if barack obama loses i really will feel sorry and sad for the state of america the world is watching and the world will judge us on that
702063 and im not voting for him simply because hes black the worst thing ever for black people would be to put someone in who wasnt capable but what he represents to a little kid in marcy projects in brooklyn new york right now is to make him feel like hes part of america we never felt like we were part of the american dream
702064 some people have to do better or theyll be some changes
702065 its not a threat or anything i dont want to and hope i dont have to but thats just the way it is
702066 whats going on right now is not good enough its been disappointing from day 1

702084 to be an internationalist you must first of all have an interest in the world
702085 a second requirement for being a true internationalist is to have ones own clear points of view and to be prepared to express them in a way that will carry weight with others
702086 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
702087 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
702088 i think the city is giving the protesters a forum to express their first amendment rights and inside of the xcel center we as in the republican party will be doing the same
702089 i really think that speaks to the real impact of the bush agenda
702090 the war affects lots of people in lots of different ways people really do see the war as connected to the domestic issues
702091 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
702092 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
702093 we compare the war in iraq with the growing war in colombia
702094 drivers have cashed in their savings bonds and 401ks to pay for operating a truck
702095 i think that theres lots of room for lots of different ways of doing things
702096 if certain groups choose to act out in ways that are breaking the law if they do so violently im opposed to it but at the same time i understand it

702110 the scottish government and any government with a principled stance should not be going near any firm with such associations even indirectly
702111 the government is opening itself up to significant and justified protest
702112 ordinary members of the public could refuse to have anything to do with the census a boycott is something to be considered it would be a legitimate step we cannot ignore our principles
702113 the scottish government was elected on a mandate that it had a human rights conscience and was different to labour now it seems the scottish government is already closing its eyes to what is going on overseas would we say it was ok if a firm connected to mugabe was hired to run our census it is unacceptable that they have been hired this will horrify most ordinary people it is unacceptable that the scottish government should be selling its soul to an organisation accused of torturing human beings
702114 the us government doesnt give a damn about peoples rights itll gather data in any way possible how can we be sure that the census information will not be handed over to the us government in the interests of homeland security
702115 allegations of improper conduct made against the parent company have been vehemently denied but in any event there is no link between these allegations and the work of caci uk
702116 the best and most competitively priced of the bids we received delivering best value for tax payers money
702117 this allegation was not substantiated by any evidence or proof
702118 and subsequent investigations by both caci and the us government could not confirm it no caci employee was ever depicted in the shocking and disturbing photos seen in the press
702119 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

702127 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
702128 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
702129 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
702130 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
702131 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
702132 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be
702133 they own the land and they can do what they want with it
702134 we need a business to keep people here not drive people away
702135 its a little difficult when you dont have direct contact with the landowners
702136 this is a significant change whether you like it or not
702137 we want to be a good neighbor and partner and were trying to find ways to do that
702138 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
702139 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
702140 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
702141 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
702142 we have to start teaching these young kids that are getting on the internet and writing these things to be careful about the words theyre using
702143 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
702144 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
702145 we will raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
702146 im running for this office because i want to make life better i dont think rep kilpatrick has done a good enough job
702147 anybody who goes to congress can bring home the dollars

702150 s epic domestic box office record of 600 million but maintaining the top spot three weeks in a row is an impressive feat especially in todays crowded marketplace back in 1998 james camerons film stayed at no 1 for 15 consecutive weeks
702151 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
702152 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
702153 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
702154 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
702155 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
702156 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
702157 hopefully with our data china can see the need to take a dramatic policy strategy to continue the good policies they conducted during the games
702158 we have all but won this thing when they once said that was impossible
702159 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
702160 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
702161 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
702162 theres not a lot of christian functions where people say whos bringing the beer
702163 but god intended us as the beer commercial says to live with gusto its just that we are not to leave god out of the discussion
702164 we are unshakably bible believing jesus loving christians who believe our job is reconciling people together to god and to each other and not drawing them apart
702165 i listened and i said no matter where you are on the issue thats wrong that was a breakthrough
702166 its not a matter of building walls or creating safe havens so we can feel better about ourselves
702167 its about creating an environment where we understand we are participating in the reconciling redemptive work of jesus
702168 god is our audience and our call is to serve and bring people to christ instead of creating division its creating commonality
702169 many are talking less about politics period and more about spiritual nurture in terms of feeding the hungry clothing the naked and being good stewards of gods creation
702170 we proclaim that jesus is our king and is teaching us how to live in the world on the flip side we strongly believe god is neither a republican or a democrat there is a new politic interested in both proclamational truth and social justice
702171 ive seen so many denominations draw lines in the sand
702172 we dont see that as a sin thats any worse than the other sins so youre welcome to worship with us knowing the direction were heading
702173 what were trying to do is say everybody come on in it gets chaotic but theres life here
702174 or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into christ jesus have been baptized into his death therefore we have been buried with him through baptism unto death so that as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of father so we too might walk in newness of life
702175 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
702176 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
702177 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
702178 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
702179 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts

702271 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
702272 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games

702370 es muss etwas an der schulter des reifens eingedrungen sein
702371 wir haben keine tr mmerteile in der lauffl che entdecken k nnen aber es besteht die m glichkeit eines schnitts in der seitenwand
702372 das bedeutet dass es eine sehr d nne schulterfl che nahe am boden gibt vielleicht hat ein stein die seitenwand ber hrt und so den plattfu ausgel st
702373 ohne den reifenschaden w re er der sieger gewesen aber es ist sehr gut wenn der teamkollege dann da ist
702374 er wird noch mehr rennen gewinnen in diesem jahr und in den jahren danach
702375 ich hatte einen schlechten start und kam nur als achter aus der ersten runde
702376 aber ich war sehr stark auf der bremse und konnte so einige piloten berholen am schluss sah ich dann kevin wahr vor mir der ist etwas nerv s geworden und hat sich immer umgedreht aber meine letzte runde war eine perfekte und ich konnte ihn auf der bremse berholen
702377 ich lag schon hintendran am j rg und habe dann in der zweiten runde die f hrung bernommen doch die jungs konnten mir lange folgen da wusste ich dass ich am ende zulegen muss wenn ich gewinnen will
702378 ich habe alles gegeben aber mehr als dranbleiben an bauer und teuchert war heute nicht drin
702379 ich konnte das tempo der beiden an der spitze heute nicht mitgehen sondern nur rang drei gegen werner verteidigen jetzt stehen noch vier rennen und 100 punkte aus es gibt kein pardon mehr ich will unbedingt noch einen sieg
702380 wir haben gedacht dass wir das motorrad ber den mittag verbessert haben aber das ging wohl nach hinten los da ich nicht so schnell aus den kurven herausbeschleunigen konnte wie im ersten lauf
702381 ich hatte im zweiten lauf von anfang an einen tick mehr luft nach hinten ich habe gleich gepusht aber ich war nicht ganz so schnell wie im ersten lauf die temperaturen waren wohl h her als am vormittag
702382 ich war in der falschen position und habe einige pl tze verloren
702383 diese frage stellen wir uns gerade im moment sieht es nicht danach aus dass es ein hitzeproblem war sondern ein problem anderer art
702384 ab dem samstag war es ein wochenende zum vergessen f r mich
702385 am start habe ich ein bisschen mehr reingehalten als normal
702386 jetzt m ssen wir analysieren warum der speed nicht gepasst hat
702387 ich wusste aus dem letzten jahr als ich selbst mit einem schnellen auto im mittelfeld fest hing dass es schwierig ist zu berholen
702388 ich wusste wenn er keinen fehler begehen w rde konnte kimi nicht vorbeikommen
702389 nach dem start haben wir eine unglaubliche performance gezeigt ich hatte das rennen unter kontrolle denn nach dem problem bei hamilton musste ich kein risiko mehr eingehen ich hatte 23 sekunden vorsprung auf heikki kovalainen
702390 der motorschaden ist ohne jede vorwarnung passiert wenn das rennen eigentlich schon gelaufen ist nur noch zwei runden zu fahren sind und pl tzlich der motor in rauch aufgeht ist das nat rlich kein tolles gef hl rennsport kann grausam sein
702391 das problem wird analysiert ich wei nicht was passiert ist aber es f hlte sich sehr seltsam an wir m ssen an der zuverl ssigkeit des autos weiterhin arbeiten
702392 es ist schrecklich ein rennen so zu verlieren es war aber auch f r mich kein tolles rennen
702393 solange einem langsameren auto festzustecken ist frustrierend und langweilig als ich endlich pushen konnte war das auto sehr gut aber insgesamt war es schon zu sp t
702394 als ich auf glock auflief hatte ich ein mechanisches problem im heckbereich also musste ich tempo rausnehmen es war ein entt uschendes wochenende aber zumindest habe ich mich mit einem annehmbaren ergebnis zur ckgemeldet

702396 ive heard that there is support growing for including coaches in consideration for the hall of fame in the future
702397 obviously im not going to be too objective about this but theres no question that two names immediately come to mind when you talk about great coaches of the last 25 years in terms of batting coaches you have charlie lau and in terms of pitching coaches you have dunc
702398 whenever over the years ive been asked where i might manage next i always answer that if you find out where dave duncan is coaching thats where ill be managing
702399 to me hes the complete pitching coach it doesnt matter if its a left hander or right hander young or old starter or reliever quiet guy or loud guy mechanics or preparation how to attack a hitter or how pitch to the defense the bottom line is that he does it all that he always has something that can help a pitcher improve
702400 working with dunc gives you confidence in what youre doing because you always know that hes worked out the best plan for you you never have to wonder about his advice because you know its always right on
702401 if you do the things dunc outlines for you you know you have the best chance for succeeding
702402 its a total thing its not just stuff with your delivery or going over scouting reports or pitch sequences its everything dunc prepares you to be at your best
702403 hes hit everything pitches at every location whether its because hes from here and he gets fired up to play us i dont know but hes been very very good against us
702404 i knew there was only about a 5 percent chance of getting it up and down from that bad lie but i still tried to hit a perfect shot today facing the same shot i would just take a bogey and move on
702405 all of a sudden ive got the lead on the seventh tee then i bogeyed three holes in a row and im behind again
702406 just the fact i had done it and knew how my body might react really helped
702407 you just believe you could do it again i played pretty well the first three days but not very good at all the last day i just scraped it around i finally started to hit the ball around the 12th hole and having gone through that a few times you have a sense of what you need to do to keep your emotions in control and rhythm in control and thats one of the reasons why i was able to get it back together the last six holes and started hitting some decent shots it was a great experience
702408 there are so many greens with an upper level hole location or a little ridge where it is so hard to get the ball anywhere near that location with an approach shot if you get real aggressive and knock it over the green youve got no chance to get it up and down the smart shots leave you 40 footers and some tough two putts its just a long hard golf course with greens that are brutally difficult

702439 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
702440 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting

702582 that goes against everything i have been taught to believe

702738 creeds are statements of faith that are true and authoritative insofar as they accurately reflect what scriptures teaches sic
702739 religious people differ widely as to the creeds by which they are governed but the bible itself is a creed the propriety fitness necessity and sufficiency of which every protestant creed known to me most solemnly affirms the scriptures affirm their own sufficiency ii tim 3 16 17 to this all believers in the bible assent in reference to the propriety and fitness of the creed approved and given in the bible there is unanimity it is only when we begin to introduce creeds not in the bible creeds of human ordering framing and adoption that trouble arises there is unanimity in reference to the bible as a creed the diversity arises when other creeds than the bible are proposed or adopted

702745 probably about 225 000 more people living with hiv in the usa than official figures have been reporting
702746 the country had roughly 56 300 new hiv infections in 2006 about a 40 percent increase from the 40 000 annual estimate used for the past dozen years the new figure is due to a better blood test and new statistical methods and not a worsening of the epidemic officials said
702747 reveals that the epidemic is and has been worse than previously estimated
702748 the new infection estimate is based on a blood test that for the first time can tell how recently an hiv infection occurred
702749 the new estimate relies on blood tests from 22 states where health officials have been using a new hiv testing method that can distinguish infections that occurred within the past five months from those that were older
702750 likened the new estimate to adding a good speedometer to a car scientists had a good general idea of where the epidemic was going this provides a better understanding of how fast its moving right now
702751 conducted a separate historical analysis that provides new insight into hiv incidence trends over time overall and for specific populations
702752 the new report found that infections are falling among heterosexuals and injection drug users
702753 the analysis also found that new infections among blacks are at a higher level than any other racial or ethnic group though they have been roughly stable with some fluctuation since the early 1990s
702754 a tribute to prevention efforts including nearly 200 syringe exchange programs now operating in 36 states despite a federal ban on funding for such projects
702755 also lamented the cdcs finding that infections continue to increase in gay and bisexual men who accounted for more than half of hiv infections in 2006 also more than a third of those with hiv are younger than 30
702756 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
702757 the higher estimate of annual new hiv infections does not mean that hiv prevention does not work what is failing is national leadership to fund and support sound scientifically effective hiv prevention programs
702758 the revised cdc figure represents an unacceptable level of new hiv infections for a preventable disease the revised estimate underlines the need for a national aids strategy with measurable outcomes reliance on evidence based programs and sufficient funding stopping the spread of hiv and treating all people living with hiv must be a high priority for our leaders and the american public
702759 is guided by a strategic plan clear benchmarks like the prevention of seven million h i v infections by 2010 and annual progress reports to congress
702760 federal law blocks federal funding for syringe exchange programs which the scientific literature has demonstrated clearly as an effective hiv prevention tool support for comprehensive sex education that helps keep young people healthy is neglected while the current administration supports pouring millions of dollars into abstinence only programs that have been proven to be ineffective

702764 given the seriousness of the issues given the fact that the decisions we make right now are going to help determine the future not just of the next generation but perhaps generations after that given the magnitude of our challenges when it comes to energy and health care and jobs and our foreign policy youd think wed been having serious conversations about solutions to our problems but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears
702765 is that really what this elections about is that what is worthy of the american people

702783 c nd am venit prima dat ne a pl cut foarte tare aceast cas i am nceput s c ut m posibilit i s o cump r m am descoperit c apar inea prim riei din biertan dar ni te romi locuiau n ea primarul era gata s ne o dea dar numai dac g seam o solu ie pentru romi a a c am g sit o cas pentru ei am cump rat o ei au devenit proprietarii acelei case ceea ce a fost un noroc pentru ei n au avut nicio problem n a accepta schimbul i apoi am cump rat noi casa de la prim rie am restaurat o i acum locuim n ea
702784 dup p rerea mea dac refaci o construc ie numai cu un pic de var a a cum este tradi ia tencuiala rezist pu in pentru c nu exist ciment care s lipeasc bine totul
702785 n general fac asta reconstruc ie dup tradi ie doar cei care au bani mul i
702786 nu cred c termopanul de exemplu d uneaz foarte tare dar e drept c aduce confort dar stric forma structural a caselor vechi ca s i mpaci pe to i cred c cel mai bine e s folose ti termopane dar cu rama de lemn i a a atingi dou scopuri deodat i confort i p strarea tradi iei
702787 cred c cea mai eficient ar fi o lege pentru renovarea caselor s se ti pentru c altfel nu vom convinge oamenii
702788 dac satul r m ne a a cum este i casele vor fi bine restaurate sunt sigur c din ce n ce mai mul i oameni vor dori s vad aceste locuri minunate de altfel eu de exemplu am cump rat n total apte case i mi a dori s le includ ntr un circuit turistic s nu ne bucur m de locurile astea doar noi i prietenii no tri din p cate oamenii care i restaureaz casele acum fac lucruri care sunt complet n afara arhitecturii tradi ionale obi nuite n afara schimb rii culorilor ei schimb propor iile ferestrelor folosesc termopan sau materiale care nu fac parte din stilul tradi ional i f c nd asta ruineaz satul vechi
702789 cred c primul pas este s dai un exemplu a a cum am f cut noi i l am f cut cu oameni din sat care au stat pe l ng noi doi sau trei ani i au n eles c t de important este i c t conteaz s refaci ntr un mod tradi ional chiar i cele mai mici detalii apoi s o faci la scar mai larg cred c da e nevoie de autorit i e nevoie de legi sau directive care vin de sus pentru c nu cred c altfel oamenii vor proceda corect de la sine
702790 i asum responsabilitatea pentru a face demersurile necesare pentru a conserva arhitectura istoric i tradi ional conform cerin elor europene i de a pune n valoare poten ialul turistic
702791 noi am promovat acest manifest mpreun cu giorgio ficcarelli de la uniunea european care a vorbit cu primarii i i a rugat s se al ture pentru c este nevoie de o autoritate n spatele acestei idei am f cut mpreun lista primarilor le am trimis scrisorile i i am convins s vin s semneze
702792 felul n care vrem s i ajut m pe oameni s restaureze corect casele va fi printr un fond i acesta va fi alimentat cu bani publici i priva i i vom da drumul prima dat n cop a mare
702793 pe oamenii care vor s i schimbe acoperi ul de exemplu i vom ajuta s pl teasc diferen a dintre un albastru oribil sau aluminiu i igla tradi ional

703195 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
703196 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
703197 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less

703218 nach dem start haben wir eine unglaubliche performance gezeigt ich hatte das rennen unter kontrolle denn nach dem problem bei hamilton musste ich kein risiko mehr eingehen ich hatte 23 sekunden vorsprung auf heikki kovalainen
703219 der motorschaden ist ohne jede vorwarnung passiert wenn das rennen eigentlich schon gelaufen ist nur noch zwei runden zu fahren sind und pl tzlich der motor in rauch aufgeht ist das nat rlich kein tolles gef hl rennsport kann grausam sein
703220 das problem wird analysiert ich wei nicht was passiert ist aber es f hlte sich sehr seltsam an wir m ssen an der zuverl ssigkeit des autos weiterhin arbeiten
703221 es ist schrecklich ein rennen so zu verlieren es war aber auch f r mich kein tolles rennen

703234 if i were in canada i would be hopping mad about the lack of ability to crack down on these corrupt people who are involved in this trade and on the farmers who are growing the opium
703235 they are clearly financing the people who are attacking your troops attacking the british troops in helmand province and attacking the americans throughout as well
703236 his power base is in helmand and kandahar provinces thats where 70 to 80 per cent of the opium is grown and he does not want to crack down on the people there because he needs their support for re election
703237 look we cannot support your government anymore if youre protecting narco traffickers
703238 you karzai need to hit the trade at all levels
703239 we all agree with the fundamental need to deal with the problem
703240 i know that canada is prepared to set up and be part of the solution does it necessarily mean going out and burning crops or whatever the latest technique is im not sure about that
703241 it may well be better to focus on interdiction to break down the downstream supply chain that creates the value as opposed to alienating the farmers whose support you ultimately need as you build democracy in afghanistan

703252 were not done yet because you never heard my side and we talking this way is very unprofessional
703253 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
703254 it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
703255 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
703256 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
703257 when it was just wet everybodys deal went fine competitors and our stuff alike
703258 i think it was just making sure that the standing water was gone there were some areas that the drainage didnt keep up with the precipitation
703259 we have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
703260 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain
703261 i couldnt see 5 feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution
703262 when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
703263 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
703264 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
703265 i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it
703266 it felt really slow and the car was slipping around
703267 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept on the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important
703268 as old as they are theyre a little hard so there was zero grip out there
703269 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
703270 we just did the best we could with what we had to work with
703271 it was a learning experience nascar did what it had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
703272 well take the input from the teams that were there and see if theres something else that we could do that we dont know we needed to do

703276 firstly you must be skint and on the dole anybody with a proper job or tied up with full time education will not have the time to devote to see it through being on the dole gives you a clearer perspective on how much of society is run having no money sharpens the wits forces you never to make the wrong decision there is no safety net to catch you when you fall

703280 it was an excuse to say a lot of things i wanted to say about how the industry worked it was an excuse to go out and say to people all they can say to themselves if you want to do something go and do it dont wait to be asked dont wait for a record company to come and want to sign you or a management company just go and do it also it was saying if you wanna have number one you can have it it wont make you rich it wont make you happy but you can have it

703310 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
703311 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
703312 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
703313 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

703327 its for us we are as emotional as our clients if we did not have that policy in place we very likely would be arguing among ourselves emotion is not in the process its preordained it means we do what people say they want to do sell high and buy low
703328 their own portfolios are down or their practice fees are down if you had an investment plan and either the adviser or you are making dramatic deviations from that policy thats a red flag
703329 the rational investor sells when things are expensive and buys when theyre cheap
703330 in a down market i can buy funds or securities that havent been this cheap in years

703335 the spinach scare a couple of years ago tomatoes and jalapenos more recently people are really thinking more about where their food is coming from what happens to it between the farm and their plate and csa gives them that really direct connection of knowing whos growing their food and where its coming from and how its being grown
703336 theres such a great array of people from whom sen obama can choose
703337 so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards
703338 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
703339 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
703340 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
703341 i dont know that wed get t shirts made that say it but we take pride in not leaking we take pride in not being a typical campaign
703342 when all the layers got peeled back they were actually leaking
703343 there is a feeling now that were going to win this thing and people are starting to talk about who is going to be what a few months from now
703344 the small team atmosphere has changed and that has caused some frictions on the inside
703345 based on the way were all sitting you cant tell where everybody fits in the hierarchy and thats a good thing
703346 but any who hoped we would finally speak with one voice or
703347 on its own it could mean that nothing matters enough to us to understand why some conflicts are unavoidable and very costly why some
703348 but any who hoped we would finally speak with one voice or
703349 on its own it could mean that nothing matters enough to us to understand why some conflicts are unavoidable and very costly why some
703350 the statement which follows cannot hope to capture the mood and experience of the lambeth conference 2008
703351 cold words are inadequate to express the quality and passion of the journey we have shared we have listened intently to one another we have laughed together and wept together we have discovered in our bible study and indaba groups the kind of friendship and fellowship which is life changing
703352 this statement represents a distillation of insights and opinions not from a single group but from 16 indaba groups and it therefore takes the form of a patchwork which no editorial process can make seamless without creating a garment that never existed
703353 in order to read this document with appreciation you must allow yourself to imagine that you are in a safe space with others whom you have come to love and whose opinions you have grown to respect at the deepest level only the reader can breathe love humor tears admiration urgency and imagination into this document so that it can truly live and so that the experiences that gave it birth can be seen to have animated our renewed relationships

703361 dicen que no as que quiero seguir jugando en esta divisi n por razones obvias las que expuse claramente a la gerencia
703362 ich lasse mich nicht festlegen wann wie und wo ich zuk nftig meine meinung u ern werde
703363 es geht doch nicht darum dass ich da mal irgendwo einen kommentar geschrieben habe zu dem ich auch jederzeit stehe sondern es geht in wahrheit um den kurs der spd
703364 die reformen die wir gemeinsam mit wolfgang clement durchgesetzt haben haben in der spd viele wunden gerissen die werden aber nicht rascher verheilen wenn clement die spd verlassen muss
703365 dass auf der n chsten ebene eine einvernehmliche l sung erreicht wird
703366 das ist ein reines ablenkungsman ver mit dem ziel sich wichtig zu machen und streit in die spd zu tragen
703367 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
703368 it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
703369 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
703370 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
703371 when it was just wet everybodys deal went fine competitors and our stuff alike
703372 i think it was just making sure that the standing water was gone there were some areas that the drainage didnt keep up with the precipitation
703373 we have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
703374 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain
703375 i couldnt see five feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution
703376 when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
703377 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
703378 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
703379 i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it
703380 it felt really slow and the car was slipping around
703381 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept on the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important
703382 as old as they are theyre a little hard so there was zero grip out there
703383 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
703384 we just did the best we could with what we had to work with
703385 it was a learning experience nascar did what it had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
703386 well take the input from the teams that were there and see if theres something else that we could do that we dont know we needed to do
703387 det k nns fantastiskt att vi kan f in det m let
703388 jag oroar mig f r hur det blir om vi f r barn

703395 many parents are looking for ways to disconnect their kids from the electronic media that keep them indoors and reconnect them with nature and with each other
703396 fishing is an inexpensive and very enjoyable way to accomplish that but lots of parents havent fished for years they can come to our clinics and brush up on fishing techniques or even learn from scratch right along with their kids
703397 theres such a great array of people from whom sen obama can choose
703398 so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards
703399 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
703400 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
703401 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
703402 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
703403 experience is what you get when you didnt get what you wanted
703404 how can i describe what my sister is going through losing a child after losing a mother we had to make her aware she couldnt cope with it she kept crying and crying and screaming and the family was there trying to support her and calm her down
703405 for weeks she had been unconscious and she only came round a week ago we hid my mothers death from her because we wanted to tell her when she got a bit better
703406 but when she heard alana was dead she was determined to see her mum and we had to tell her everything its good that she knows now but she will forget for a bit and then she remembers and starts crying again its going to take some time
703407 we are devastated with my mother dying and now my niece dying as well its a massive shock to us and all the community
703408 she was an innocent girl on holiday here she was getting to the age where she could start school she was just an honest little child who was so close to her mother how can i describe it this shouldnt have happened to her
703409 my father has lost his wife and his grandaughter my sister has lost her daughter and her mother and ive lost my mother and my niece i have this anger that as the older son i couldnt do anything if i was there in the house with my father and my brother we would have climbed in the fire to help
703410 when you win an election you win the majority and what is the power of the speaker to set the agenda the power of recognition and i am not giving the gavel away to anyone
703411 the fuselage of the plane rolled through our group and subsequently caused massive injuries to all involved
703412 my first reaction was to hit the ground and then after receiving minor injuries i went into rescue and help mode to aid my fellow paratroopers
703413 there was a split second delay to process what we were witnessing and then all of us picked a direction and ran
703414 my feet carried me along the line of mock doors when two seconds later i found myself on fire
703415 at some point i realized i had to drop and did my best to smother the flames i thought incorrectly
703416 i never knew who he was and had never seen him again until recently
703417 i came to his office because i needed his signature to get a bamc identification card
703418 since the day of the accident i have only been able to give a heartfelt thanks to all those folks who were involved with my health care
703419 to actually find one of the first responders is a rare gift
703420 hero and heroic are words that i would choose to describe sgt maj whelan a real hero doesnt know hes a hero and that will always be true
703421 a real hero is one who has to be told that he is one even though he doesnt believe it
703422 it scarred me to see my brothers killed in front of me and although i helped many that day to see how fragile life is made me feel helpless but also gave me a different perspective on the importance of being a good medic and more importantly a better human being
703423 i still wonder what if how could i have done things better they say what doesnt kill you makes you stronger thats a lie what doesnt kill you makes you more aware of how precious life is
703424 i have been told that im a hero before and i have a hard time accepting it
703425 i think all soldiers if put in that situation would hopefully react to save their brothers and sisters regardless of danger
703426 i never thought i would see any of the folks that i physically put hands on but to this day i have a hard time dealing with that day meeting and sharing with staff sgt scharmen has not only been a good experience but also a healing experience
703427 i was able to live that is the primary consequence as a result of living i was able to meet my wife jenny whom ive been married 12 years
703428 ive been able to serve honorably in different capacities within the army and just lately as a liaison helping soldiers in whatever way i can
703429 now i have benefitted again by thanking the man who made all this possible
703430 in the most searing dissection yet of philadelphias child welfare agency a grisly grand jury report yesterday found that a 14 year old girl rotted in her bed because of the systems brutal indifference
703431 one of the saddest lessons of history is this if weve been bamboozled long enough we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle
703432 i hate men base in deeds but wise in words
703433 we claim the privilege of worshiping almighty god according to the dictates of our own conscience and allow all men the same privilege let them worship how where or what they may
703434 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it
703435 jared and his brother came on to this continent from the confusion and the scattering at the tower tower of babel and lived here more than a thousand years and covered the whole continent from sea to sea with towns and cities
703436 as man is god once was as god is man may become
703437 we plead with them not to worry too much about whether they have a lot of conversions or whether they dont we want them to feel that they had a great experience that they served that they loved the people and learned a lot
703438 i saw a striking contrast in the progress of the indian people today the day of the lamanites is nigh for years they have been growing delightsome and they are now becoming white and delightsome as they were promised in this picture of twenty lamanite missionaries fifteen of the twenty were as light as anglos five were darker but equally delightsome the children in the home placement program in utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation
703439 now we are generous with the negro we are willing that the negro have the highest kind of education i would be willing to let every negro drive a cadillac if they could afford it i would be willing that they have all the advantages they can get out of life in the world but let them enjoy these things among themselves
703440 those who were less valiant in pre existence and who thereby had certain spiritual restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as the negroes
703441 the negroes are not equal with other races where the receipt of certain spiritual blessings are concerned but this inequality is not of mans origin it is the lords doing is based on his eternal laws of justice and grows out of the lack of spiritual valiance of those concerned in their first estate the mormon pre existence
703442 weve always counseled in the church for our mexican members to marry mexicans our japanese members to marry japanese our caucasians to marry caucasians our polynesian members to marry polynesians
703443 i can show you local church leaders or perhaps even general leaders who have married out of their race
703444 wed like to follow the rule first and then well take care of the exceptions
703445 i will remark with regard to slavery inasmuch as we believe in the bible inasmuch as we believe in the ordinances of god in the priesthood and order and decrees of god we must believe in slavery
703446 i am a firm believer in slavery those servants want to come here with their masters and they commence to whisper round their views upon the subject saying do you think its right
703447 when a master has a negro and uses him well he is much better off than when he is free as for masters knocking them down and whipping them and breaking the limbs of their servants i have as little opinion of that as any person can have but good wholesome servitude i know there is nothing better than that
703448 if there never was a prophet or apostle of jesus christ spoke it before i tell you this people that are commonly called negroes are the children of old cain i know they are
703449 again to the subject before us as to the negro men bearing rule not one of the children of old cain have one particle of right to bear rule in government affairs from first to last they have no business there this privilege was taken from them by their own transgressions and i cannot help it
703450 i am as much opposed to the principle of slavery as any man in the present acceptation or usage of the term it is abused
703451 therefore i will not consent for one moment to have an african dictate to me or my brethren with regard to church or state government no it is not right
703452 what the gentiles are doing we are consenting to do hes referring to the
703453 our individual personal testimonies are based on the witness of the spirit not on any combination or accumulation of historical facts if we are so grounded no alteration of historical facts can shake our testimonies
703454 now we have an interesting custom in the church departing missionaries are accorded a farewell in some wards this has become a problem between outgoing missionaries and returning missionaries most sacrament meetings are devoted to farewells and homecomings no one else in the church has a farewell when entering a particular service we never have a special farewell type meeting for a newly called bishop for a stake president for a relief society president for a general authority or anyone else of whom i can think why should we have missionary farewells the first presidency and the twelve after most prayerful and careful consideration have reached the decision that the present program of missionary farewells should be modified the departing missionary will be given opportunity to speak in a sacrament meeting for 15 or 20 minutes but parents and siblings will not be invited to do so there might be two or more departing missionaries who speak in the same service the meeting will be entirely in the hands of the bishop and will not be arranged by the family there will not be special music or anything of that kind
703455 we hope also that holding elaborate open houses after the sacrament meeting at which the missionary speaks will not prevail members of the family may wish to get together we have no objection to this however we ask that there be no public reception to which large numbers are invited
703456 satan is waging war directly at the heart of gods plan the family
703457 shouldnt it be do you have any interests outside of chess
703458 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
703459 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
703460 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
703461 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
703462 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision
703463 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
703464 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
703465 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
703466 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
703467 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
703468 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
703469 if he can contribute 15 25 plays in game situations that is great one guy we had out here was javon nanton that played just 15 plays a game and was a third down specialist he led the big east in sacks one year if he can do that then great but if not then he is our future
703470 we have a couple guys down since i played d end in high school coach made the decision i could make the move
703471 physically i feel good really i just got to use my technique and ill be fine ive put on 15 pounds since ive been here im up to 241 right now i got to use my speed my feet my technique when i take on a big guy im working with eric moncur hes teaching me pretty much steven wesley too theyre teaching me to be fast with my hands and how to move on the line without standing still
703472 im just focused on the things i got to do now
703473 and then the next two for a first and second team
703474 those guys have picked up their game fast brandon harris is a great defensive back who will help us a lot this year vaughn telemaque and ramon buchanon are ballers right there real ballers theyll help us out this year
703475 all the receivers are good they got their different styles laron is a big physical receiver thearon and kendall thompkins are slashy guys davon johnson and travis benjamin and tommy streeter will spread the field on you you have to watch how you cover them those guys are good
703476 vi har tr net h rdere fysisk end vi plejer i sommeropstarten og jeg tror at det g r udslaget det er n dvendigt for at vi kan arbejde h rdt som et hold som er vores styrke
703477 vi smed faktisk alt for mange lette bolde v k hele kampen igennem
703478 efter deres f ringsm l spillede vi en m gelendig kamp
703479 vi blev straffet og det er rgerligt at vi kunne falde s dybt

703586 which democracy do you speak of the musharrafs concept of it or bhuttos definition to many it is a symbol of immorality greed hypocrisies and totalitarianism of sorts because of how they view the way we live here in the west
703587 the people in the west are nothing but hypocrites it is their domination and oppression on other countries that has lead to this the poor and insecure leaders of the world cannot answer to the west and therefore have to conduct their duties against their own people to make the west happy
703588 you have them why are you trying to tell us we cannot have them
703589 i think that all the speculation is going to come to an end soon because at least were going to get choices before too long
703590 i talked to barack about it this week and you know what he did he just smiled
703591 rode around in a few circles and then ended up going south on 441
703592 a couple of times he drove on the wrong side of the road
703593 once that initial set of files gets copied you then go back into answering questions personally i dont like this sort of do some work then ask more questions then do more work thing
703594 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
703595 i had the courage and the judgment to say that i would rather lose a political campaign than lose a war it seems to me that senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
703596 what are you doing that prevents you from attracting a husband
703597 id bet it was my wednesday night ritualistic animal slaughters
703598 but after that we do play poker youd think theyd stick around for the coke and pretzels

703603 my surprise was as complete as yours as well as receiving her house and land your aunt was co owner of the willowcreek inn in oregon if you accept the inheritance you will take her place as co owner
703604 then it was your aunts wish that you sell your share and remove yourself from this place
703605 if you wish to retain ownership then i will walk you through the paperwork however if you decide that you would rather use the money from the sale of the property and buy yourself a decent life i will draw up the necessary papers for you it would be thoughtful if you would decide quickly i am a very busy and important man and have much to do this afternoon
703606 not unless it was another immaculate conception in which case i may be giving birth to the anti christ
703607 weve always got raccoons coming in the open doors looking for something to eat welcome to willowcreek

703618 serbias eu membership is the supreme national interest and this government will not give up on it
703619 serbia will never give up on its territorial integrity and sovereignty
703620 i am ready to take any risk for my policies which open up the perspective for the citizens of serbia
703621 what is important is that we keep inflation under control
703622 that is important for the sake of our economic future and for the sake of joining the european union
703623 pre election pledges must be fulfilled in a way any responsible government would do by maintaining macroeconomic stability
703624 the government and the central bank are obliged to coordinate policy to ensure the stability of the financial system
703625 while attuned to the worshipful presence of harley buffs it also recalls such great retail spaces as the galleria in milan
703626 this country doesnt need any more spectacles like the slow unfolding of fdas investigation of the recent salmonella outbreak the present system is not just a public health concern but an issue for producers feeling the economic impact of food safety scares
703627 this food safety bill gives fda the authority it needs to prevent and respond to food safety problems from requiring recalls to setting food safety standards for fresh produce to enhancing trace back and surveillance of food borne illness its a win win for producers and consumers
703628 when americans go to the grocery store the last thing on their mind should be the safety of the foods they are bringing home to serve their families
703629 the recent salmonella outbreak highlights the current vulnerability of our food supply and the need to modernize our food safety laws we cannot afford to wait until the next food borne illness outbreak or an intentional attack on our food supply occurs for congress to act on this bipartisan legislation to ensure the safety of our food and restore confidence in the quality of these products for american families

703638 the sources named in the publications have stated under oath that statements attributed to them in the articles were either not made by them were misquoted by the authors were misconstrued or the statements were taken out of context
703639 tonys short fiction has been published across the united states and japan his first two mysteries have attracted the attention of both award panels and literary critics
703640 tony has been in frequent demand as a guest on radio and college campuses to talk about writing the taliban and middle east culture
703641 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
703642 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
703643 we expect a contact between mr solana and mr jalili soon by phone
703644 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks and this is a clear message to the international community to continue with real and effective sanctions
703645 the international community is being watched not only by iran but also by irans neighbors and when the international community shows hesitation this is being perceived as weakness
703646 we live in a neighborhood in which whether you beat the bully or join it
703647 we need to understand that we need to act today in terms of sanctions sanctions can be effective as long as the iranians and the entire world understand that all the options are on the table this is what we need to do today
703648 we decided and promised to make all the efforts to reach a peace treaty until the end of the year we are making all the efforts to do so
703649 sinse your taking the car thurs and fri can i go out saturday
703650 happens to stop by to give her a little talking to
703651 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
703652 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
703653 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
703654 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
703655 theres such a great array of people from whom sen obama can choose
703656 so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards
703657 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
703658 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
703659 recent scientific studies have revealed shocking information about vitamin and mineral supplements
703660 compared to a base product or other appropriate reference product
703661 seems to me that saying the reduced calorie berry smoothie is better for you than the full calorie strawberry banana smoothie is like saying a light cigarette is healthier than a regular one
703662 i could see the baby was very pink so obviously badly burned
703663 he was so calm really really calm compared to what had happened to him
703664 we are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen anyone leaving the block around this time or any vehicle arriving or departing

703675 when you look at how people use technology embedded systems mobile computing mobile internet devices servers super computing in almost every aspect of technology linux is emerging as the dominant platform
703676 we are seeing this incredibly unique cross pollinization of innovation
703677 weve had a lot of hand wringing around fragmentation in the past
703678 how do you create applications for mobile and embedded linux how do you to go to market with linux systems how are they received by the eco system how do isvs actually make money with apps and how do operators roll out new services and deploy apps to support their business models
703679 there is no single platform that has a single code base that covers as many different kinds of applications and niches as linux does
703680 linux is expanding its presence in other workloads as it continues to hold down key success areas in web and infrastructure roles
703681 the linuxworld product excellence awards are considered the industry standard for innovation in the linux community
703682 every year we look forward to recognizing our exhibitors who truly affect this industry by developing products that represent the best technology available to users of linux and open source
703683 we are thrilled that ingres cafe has been named a finalist for a linuxworld product excellence award
703684 the ingres cafe community bundle takes the guesswork out of determining which set of components are required to build and deploy rich java applications with eclipse and ingres all with a simple three click install
703685 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
703686 im giving away the job that ive loved for five years and put my heart and soul into the job because my minds just told me to pack it in
703687 if i kept going i thought my career could come to an abrupt end i think this decision will hopefully prolong my career
703688 theres many people that i want to thank first of all i want to thank the players ive had the privilege of captaining
703689 its an honour to captain your country but to captain the good blokes ive had to captain as well i really want to thank all them
703690 all the england support staff throughout the five years theres been changes but every single one of them has given me 110 support numerous occasions of advice passed on plenty of their own knowledge and helped me in the job ive tried to do
703691 i would like to thank michael vaughan for his contribution he has been the been the most successful england has ever had
703692 he led england to new heights as a captain his performances with the bat on the 2002 03 ashes tour were some of the finest the sport has ever seen and he was undoubtedly the driving force to regaining the ashes in 2005
703693 that the global ocean has lost more than 90 of large predatory fishes
703694 the genetic species habitat and ecosystem diversity of the oceans is believed to exceed that of any other earth system
703695 throughout the worlds oceans food fishes once believed to be immeasurable in number are now recognized as greatly depleted and in some cases almost extinct a million vessels now fish the worlds oceans twice as many as there were twenty five years ago are there twice as many fish as before hardly
703696 freezing cod also changed the relationship of seafood companies to fishing ports frozen fish could be bought anywhere wherever the fish was cheapest and most plentiful with expanding markets local fleets could not keep up with the needs of the companies
703697 to three quarters of a ton and having a length of four meters
703698 the magnitude of the fishing harvest and the examples of major alterations to marine food webs by predator removal suggest that effects of fishing are ecologically substantial at large spatial scales
703699 overfishing and ecological extinction predate and precondition modern ecological investigations and the collapse of marine ecosystems in recent times raising the possibility that many more marine ecosystems may be vulnerable to collapse in the near future
703700 the use of antibiotics in salmon farming has been prevalent right from the beginning and their use in aquaculture globally has grown to such an extent that resistance is now threatening human health as well as other marine species
703701 the coastal and marine support areas needed for resource inputs and waste assimilation is
703702 short of human extinction there is no sense in which capitalism can be relied upon to permanently break down under the weight of its depletion and degradation of natural wealth
703703 time is everything man is nothing he is at the most times carcase
703704 its clear somebody has to win and somebody has to lose
703705 its not pretty at all because people say oh my god look how much money these guys are making while people are losing their homes and are complaining about the cost of eggs and sugar but so what we dont live in a society that is pretty all the time thats why its capitalism
703706 assessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity
703707 the ecological role of water column microbes in the sea
703708 out of sight and out of mind a new oceanic imperialism
703709 soybean industry looking for ways to make soy based food more palatable to farm raised fish
703710 transgenic fish and its application in basic and applied research
703711 our studies show that the prominent learning genes are not playing any role in purely behavioral learning our results suggest that pavlovian learning somehow suppresses behavioral learning
703712 to find this out one would need equivalent studies in mice or rats

703724 i am giving away the job i have loved for five years put my heart and soul into the job but my mind has told me to pack it in
703725 i feel if i kept going as captain my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career i am going to carry on playing i believe there are a lot more runs in me i hope this decision will help that
703726 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
703727 it is never too late to be what you might have been
703728 we work and we want to be paid for it
703729 the work fucks you up and you are not even paid properly for it
703730 the strike wont go on for too long they have to fulfil our demands we blockade the freight traffic of the whole country even of some of the neighbouring countries the big industrial areas depend on us
703731 last year they negotiated and signed a contract without asking us and the contract they are in process of negotiating for five months now but this time we are watching them closely
703732 to walk out is the only way to enforce our demands
703733 we are hundreds of strikers here they should come here and negotiate with us they have the space here to do that not behind our backs at some far away location
703734 it t really bother us if they don t report about us anyway what is important is that here everything keeps being at stand still in the end the country will take notice of the blockade
703735 at some point the management all left the table saying right we will meet again in front of the court we will check whether the strike is legal at all thats it for us now we dont want to waste our time they said that they have made plans for the weekend that they will take a trip to the delta of river danube go fishing
703736 do you know what guys on monday we will turn up and change our demands as well we will keep up the demand of a 700 hike but not 700 ron we talk about 700 euro
703737 if we had continued the strike for one or two more days they would have faltered and eventually given in to all our demands but what can you do there were only about fifty of us willing to continue the others got scared or maybe didnt believe any more that we could win
703738 we could have got more but in the last few days we were lacking cohesion too many were satisfied with the result
703739 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids epidemic
703740 eventually our plans are for the achievement system to become an account based system
703741 for now the points are just a wow character score as we graduate to that blizzard account system which is right on the horizon it will switch over to a blizzard level
703742 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing
703743 things like i have a horde and alliance character at maximum level or i have three max level characters
703744 for wow itll let us do a lot of really cool achievements and we can start doing those once achievements exist at the account level
703745 disciplinary techniques introduced for criminals become the model for other modern sites of control schools hospitals factories etc
703746 individuals are judged not by the intrinsic rightness or wrongness of their acts but by where their actions place them on a ranked scale that compares them to everyone else
703747 everywhere i go i hear the same thing wheres my fucking jet pack
703748 people will look back on this as a moment in history

703759 gracias a la iniciativa del consell est n empezando a llegar a l albufera especies como el correlimos com n el combatiente el archibebe com n y la agachadiza com n
703760 ha ofrecido en reiteradas ocasiones sin ser de su competencia cofinanciar la mejora y construcci n de los cuarteles de la guardia civil y las comisar as de la polic a nacional
703761 desde hace m s de un mes que les dejamos sobre la mesa una propuesta de convenio del que todav a no hemos obtenido una respuesta
703762 es la nica que tiene prevista una partida presupuestaria para este fin y la nica que tiene propuestas
703763 los presupuestos del consell para este a o incluyen una partida destinada al convenio de infraestructuras para la mejora de los cuarteles y comisar as y lejos de reducir un 11 6 por ciento los presupuestos en materia de seguridad como hace el gobierno central los hemos incrementado un 30 por ciento
703764 se ven obligados a cerrar por la noche por falta de efectivos
703765 somos un mill n de habitantes m s hemos pasado de ser la quinta autonom a en tasa de criminalidad a ser la tercera en este r nking a estar 17 5 puntos por encima de la media nacional en tasa de criminalidad y la segunda por la cola en esclarecimiento de delitos
703766 realidad una realidad que nos sorprende que el gobierno haya tardado tanto en ver
703767 resulta incre ble que a estas alturas el delegado del gobierno reconozca que los cambios sociales experimentados en la comunitat han desbordado sus previsiones
703768 reivindicar la participaci n del consell en la gesti n de los aeropuertos valencianos con un alto ndice de autonom a
703769 ha demostrado que no tiene un plan marcado y que gestiona a golpe de improvisaci n
703770 no tener las ideas claras al hacer las cosas a medias con un ocultismo y una falta de planificaci n a la que nos est acostumbrando
703771 sensible con las necesidades y con los intereses de comunidades como la valenciana y les explique de primera mano cu les son sus intenciones y su planteamiento de la misma manera que se va a reunir con los sindicatos para detallarles el plan anunciado en el consejo de ministros
703772 fundamental tener voz en las decisiones y tr mites que se desarrollen en los dos aeropuertos
703773 el nico que decida cu les son las prioridades de los aeropuertos valencianos
703774 cualquier cupo que ponga l mites a que el consell pueda participar en estas infraestructuras
703775 ya ha sufrido la marginaci n del gobierno de rodr guez zapatero en infraestructuras estrat gicas como el tren de alta velocidad o la inversi n en carreteras
703776 de nuevo no nos puede dejar al margen de unas infraestructuras esenciales para el presente y el futuro de la comunitat
703777 presupone tanto la voluntad de los inmigrantes de integrarse en la sociedad de acogida como la voluntad de la sociedad de acogida de aceptar e incluir a los inmigrantes
703778 hace mayor hincapi en el equilibrio entre derechos y deberes de los extranjeros en la comunitat
703779 han destacado el acierto de una ley que recoge un conjunto de medidas a favor de la integraci n y que no menoscaba ni los derechos ni los deberes de los inmigrantes
703780 han sido consultadas antes de la aprobaci n final por parte del consell
703781 involucrar a la sociedad valenciana en la toma de decisiones tal y como contempla la recientemente aprobada ley de participaci n ciudadana por les corts
703782 garantizar la plena ciudadan a a todos los inmigrantes residentes en la comunitat
703783 incluir en el proyecto de ley de presupuestos de la generalitat una partida espec fica destinada a la integraci n de los inmigrantes
703784 por un lado al aumento de la poblaci n extranjera en la comunitat
703785 por otro al inter s del consell por impulsar iniciativas que derivan de las directivas europeas en materia de integraci n

703793 of course arguing that men and women have different gender specific responses to global warming or the looming oil crash is a broad generalization and one that could very well prove unfounded however theres no question that the majority of women writing about peak oil are considerably more focused on what we can do now to make life better not just what we may have to do at some point down the road even if nothing happens if the polar ice caps cease to melt the smog in beijing just disappears one day and endangered species begin multiplying in vast numbers it hardly means all that tomato canning and cycling to work was a waste of time better then to keep track of all the peak oil news but remind people like savinar and kunstler that we need to be acting not just reacting
703794 excuse me have you seen a blowfish driving a sports car

703809 there should be two operators on board for the safety of everybody
703810 they waited for the ferry to move into the bank where they were able to drop the flaps and throw the anchor out
703811 this type of thing happening is very stressful and difficult on occasion but it does give the operators a chance to put all their emergency plans and contingency plans in place to see that everything works
703812 although the 21 vehicle ferry was out of action for about 24 hours the old settlement point ferry now at hibbard offering 15 cars took the pressure off the traffic flowing during the weekend

703856 i did track cycling to prove that bmx cyclists werent just people on kids bikes and to show that we are athletes
703857 the only regret i have is that i had such short notice here when i talked to council member ann kobayashi i had less than 3 hours to get everything together and i spent a good part of it trying to decide whether to do it or not
703858 i think theres an open question about that manoa seat i expect it will end up in court and there will need to be a decision made about who are real candidates and who arent
703859 i do think we need to move on enough debate on the process and that we should move on and debate the issues and ill let that be done by other people

703900 my marc left his mark on every life that he met
703901 my marc left his mark on every life that he met
703902 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
703903 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
703904 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
703905 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on
703906 especially since dry spores were not something that we prepared or worked with
703907 i cant imagine him being involved in a scheme to make money or to make a profit especially one that would put people at risk or even die
703908 thats not the bruce we knew he was sweet friendly i mean he was into grass recycling
703909 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
703910 he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
703911 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
703912 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war with iran
703913 the one plan that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the strait of hormuz start a shoot up
703914 might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans thats the kind of thats the level of stuff were talking about provocation
703915 look is it high school yeah are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
703916 was shot dead as he walked on the seashore in tartous the shooter managed to escape by sea
703917 there was no immediate comment from the syrian authorities on the reports
703918 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
703919 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
703920 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
703921 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
703922 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
703923 tell that musclebound git to pass on my best wishes
703924 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
703925 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
703926 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
703927 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
703928 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
703929 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
703930 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

703933 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive
703934 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
703935 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
703936 what sen obama said is what we want a president to say
703937 lets look at all of the options lets compare them and lets see what really does increase our supply protect our environment save our economy protect the consumer instead of a single shot thing that does none of the above
703938 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
703939 once closings started to happen we started to see more activity
703940 it was far brisker than any other pace we had seen
703941 it never held us up but it slowed things down
703942 if not for all the financial crisis and delays we would have sold the building out already
703943 we didnt find that we were losing buyers to other developments we were losing them because they couldnt close

703953 this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
703954 i feel i could have had a go at passing him massa but the damaged tyre halted my progress
703955 i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
703956 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication
703957 i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever
703958 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport we had given it our all but these things can happen now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level

703961 so all the people wanting to come to this conference were not able to because they were not able to get transit visas because they have hiv

703992 weve moved into a truly multipolar world where the power of relatively weaker states is suddenly much greater the middle east this year is but one example turkey brokers long dormant negotiations between syria and israel qatar brokered a negotiated truce between fiercely opposed factions in lebanon egypt seeks to broker negotiations between hamas and israel the palestinian authority has resumed negotiations with hamas and the pakistani government has entered into a de facto truce with the taliban inside the zones bordering afghanistan whats significant about each of these actions is that the u s opposed all of these negotiations and has simply been ignored without serious consequences for any of the actors

704007 if there were not very innocent souls to please god and make up for our offenses how many terrible punishments we would have to suffer
704008 god is quicker to forgive than a mother to snatch her child from the fire

704029 we should be embarrassed im not sure enough people are
704030 ive been disgusted the last two nights going back to the hotel
704031 we just looked like we got out pitched out hustled out managed thats embarrassing this is a good team were playing but were pretty good too
704032 this is a game about production if people cant play all out well put someone else in there who can
704033 this is not a threat im not upset but some things are not acceptable you cant keep putting the ball in peoples hands and not get production
704034 im getting a little tired of some of these performances weve got to do better they players feeling the heat can get mad at me til the cows come home but ive got people on my tail
704035 if i were my boss id be ticked off that can be a trickle down effect if i have to tell people im taking you out of the rotation thats what ill do
704036 i wont hesitate to do anything were pretty fair here id like to think but theres a difference between effort and production
704037 hustle should never be in question running a ball out running hard is a no brainer
704038 i think the owner has been absolutely impeccable absolutely unbelievable
704039 but i feel terrible ive always said if you play professional baseball for 162 games a season and if you lose its supposed to hurt a bit its supposed to bother you a little bit
704040 there has to be some kind of problem there if theres not youve got a problem
704041 because i think were too good to be playing like this and losing like this
704042 and thats my responsibility sooner or later you have to tell players and tell the media and if you cant handle that its your problem
704043 from the start of the season to this point has been more than disappointing ive been shocked by our performance
704044 weve got too many guys not producing and im not talking about one or two guys
704045 ive told this team on two or three occasions that i wouldnt trade this team for anyone else the white sox and twins first and second place clubs in the central division and i mean that with no disrespect to chicago or to the twins
704046 but weve had some performances that have been terrible ive been disgusted the last few nights the last few weeks we had situations where we should have dominated a game and we didnt come close
704047 youve got to step it up if you want to be in the hunt if not go home and come back next spring training ill bring up some kids to play
704048 if you dont want to grind it out then start your vacation early
704049 we started the work on monday morning june 30 i provided some site specific training to the crew on chemicals that we knew had been found at the apartment and then we mobilized to the site within the first few minutes i found two bottles of an unknown unlabeled material under the kitchen sink they were plastic bottles but the caps had been covered over with tape probably to make sure the bottles did not leak since the bottles were out of the way our five person crew continued working on setting everything up and began to move some of the bulk debris
704050 we suffer from hopeless romanticism well be taking donations and hey why dont we set up one of those walks for a cure
704051 wait isnt that from duece bigalow i hate that movie
704052 i told you i aint gonna die till i write my one millionth ficlet where is chakatreatmentson
704053 how long is that old serb gonna freeload off us
704054 i used to do drugs i still do but i used to also
704055 i used to have a crack problem but now i dont smoke it anymore hardly ever that much
704056 weve got a great opportunity here a chance to make our mark on a campaign for change a chance to be a constant reminder that we expect
704057 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
704058 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
704059 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
704060 a large number of spectators had gathered on a hill to see the race when lightning struck down twice among them about 2pm 2200 aest hans eng of the hedemark regional police said
704061 ninety one people have registered as having been affected by the lightning in some way at least 39 people have checked into different hospitals and others are crowding into medical centres he said
704062 yesterday evening abu mazen mr abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
704063 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
704064 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
704065 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
704066 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
704067 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
704068 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
704069 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
704070 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
704071 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
704072 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
704073 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
704074 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
704075 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
704076 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
704077 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact upon the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
704078 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished the position to specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago
704079 unfortunately for consumers this shift has come at the expense of competition with smaller regional participants building societies credit unions and non bank lenders losing market share or being pushed out entirely
704080 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times

704094 he felt ok looked a little rusty thats to be expected
704095 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
704096 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
704097 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch

704099 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
704100 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
704101 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
704102 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
704103 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
704104 in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
704105 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
704106 holbrooke strongly promised me that the hague tribunal would be history for karadzic if he withrdrew from politics forever
704107 it really sets forth with clarity various foreign policy ideals that we have as democrats it incorporates new ideas on education both k through 12 and higher education the platform on energy is very strong as is the connection between a new energy future and a new economic future for the country
704108 i think fairness in the selection of the nominee is always an issue to the democratic party but the process itself is congressional in nature and not part of this platform right now
704109 she has been saying nothing but very good things about senator obama and you know i think it is important that he reaches out to her frankly and to her supporters because she won almost 49 percent of the vote and i think she is important and 18 million people are important
704110 its time we stop just talking about family values and start pursuing policies that truly value families families are increasingly responsible for caring for children and aging relatives and its sic time for the government to meet them halfway
704111 its important that her voice and her overall policies are included and ive seen that over the last few days and its been important to clinton and her followers that you are seeing in this first draft of the platform very specific references to issues she has cared about
704112 we talk nuance word choice all the rest but the goals of a revitalized economy a strong military an emphasis on education and education for the 21st century leading into new types of jobs that we need to have
704113 these are shared values in the party and that is what is coming on to the platform

704119 across america boards of education are implementing student drug tests like they are handing out free candies they are not good candies either they are more like those hard candies from the wilson administration a grandmother would offer what makes these candies so unsatisfying is not that they violate natural rights but that they teach the wrong lessons in actuality under the correct circumstances student drug tests do not violate natural rights if all schools were privatized and children were not required by law to attend school drug tests would not initiate force in this circumstance an individual chooses to attend school he is not forced to
704120 today the need for knowledge is both instant and boundariless at learningmate its about enabling learning when you want it where you want it learningmate is all about solutions that takes learning beyond the four walls of the traditional classroom

704132 our people we believe that the way we do business is as important as the way we grow our tobacco thats why being earth friendly is a part of our everyday lives whether its using wind power to run our offices or contracting directly with organic farmers who grow tobacco using earth friendly practices were dedicated to reducing our footprint on the earth

704150 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
704151 what is taking place is causing unimaginable harm to the palestinian cause

704157 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so

704160 large scale use of ganja in jamaica dated from the importation of indentured indians
704161 we lost about five seconds and we think it is partly temperature
704162 when you get these high temperatures you get a bit of pressure coming out of the tank with the fuel we cant cool it that much and everyone was struggling toro rosso honda and williams had some issues
704163 we do as much as we can but sometimes it is temperamental we cant adjust the rigs ourselves they are standard piece of kit
704164 all we can identify so far is that the refuelling rig didnt go on exactly square so it was as simple as that
704165 there doesnt appear to be anything more than that and as a result we spilled about half a litre of fuel which was quickly put out

704169 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
704170 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
704171 we expect a contact between mr solana and mr jalili soon by phone
704172 have you done this to me havent i been the most perfect of sons to you or have i been a total arse

704175 i can see youre feeling better lad best get you on yer feet before you melt all over the floor
704176 you dont have a comb about your person i suppose
704177 this is the most enchanting entity that i have ever laid my eyes upon she is simply divine were i a more heroic type and not a dull brained geek i would sweep her from the ground and carry her away to some tiny edifice built high in the tallest of rhubarb trees
704178 i must apologize most fervently although i meant every word that i inadvertently spoke i feel i must retract them they are unbecoming especially when i speak so freely of someone i do not know
704179 fanangy panakan at your service kind sir cripes listen to me ive come over all posh
704180 youve been nose surfing on a sea of ka ka i had to hose you down
704181 thats right i slipped in some effluent upon the road
704182 its lucky i wasnt driving a go kart i could have had a nasty prang
704183 as it happens i do believe that it might have been the most serendipitous pile of poop that ive ever encountered now may i have my clothes back im feeling a little vulnerable
704184 you nearly took my claw varnish off with your teeth
704185 wait til its gone down in between times i can tell you all about the where house
704186 i dont mean to be impolite but surely after the disastrous johnny grainswallow expedition no one could either gather the funding or possess the temerity to launch another
704187 but north america held more interest for certain individuals than just super hamsters with psychedelic brains and the deadly disease hamsters arse no there was area ninety nine
704188 so there is such a place i mean its not all complete bollocks excuse my hamster french
704189 you mean they just walked in and took the stuff
704190 then the military tried to make weapons of mass destruction from it then they tried to reverse engineer it then they gave up and sold it to me for ten thousand rodentos
704191 you made this into some sort of theme park a fantasy palace you promised to take hamsters to impossible places and see wonderful ah thingys and wotsits
704192 all sorts of rodents rats mice gerbils i even took a cavy once no rabbits though too vicious even the tame ones what you can ride
704193 i got bus loads of em to start with but when i showed em all the wonders to be found in the artifacts of area ninety nine well most of em thought it was clever visual effects others thought theyd gone mad others went 11 completely off their heads and some even lost control of their bowels well of course i had to start administering sedatives didnt i then nobody believed in anything they saw they just thought theyd been on some kinda drug induced trip like you get from them mushrooms up at danglydong dell the business went tits up overnight didnt it
704194 so how do you make repayments on the ten thousand rodento loan
704195 but i get by with selling the odd trinket that i find here and there when i go exploring
704196 ya dont think i got all these area ninety nine artifacts sitting about on shelves gathering dust do ya
704197 theyve got to pay their way you know otherwise its the scrap dealer for em and i know at least one of em who wouldnt want that to happen

704229 en casa era yo la que cambiaba de idioma yo hac a el esfuerzo de cambiar el chip
704230 te acostumbras a hablar en un idioma con una persona era imposible por ejemplo hablar con mi madre en alem n
704231 mi abuela paterna se preocupaba mucho por si me liaba con los idiomas
704232 m s adelante cuando ya era m s mayor me compraba libros yo aprend el idioma de forma oral y leyendo por esto mi escritura no era muy buena

704234 me adapt en seguida con mis compa eros porque hablaba perfectamente el problema ven a a la hora de escribir
704235 adelant a mis compa eros el hecho de saber una lengua similar me dio mucha ventaja
704236 cuando estaba en alemania me daba verg enza hablar en mallorqu n delante de mis amigos porque me sent a diferente
704237 cuando mi madre me ven a a buscar a la escuela a veces yo le contestaba en alem n
704238 yo siempre tuve claro que mis hijos ten an que hablar dan s

704247 necesitamos un plan agropecuario nacional a largo plazo podemos empezar ahora o esperar al 2011
704248 nuestra identidad como pa s el ser nacional est inexorablemente ligado al campo a nuestra cultura y nuestros valores
704249 as cuando se ofende al campo se ofende al pueblo y cuando se ataca al campo se ataca a la argentina
704250 nuestros fundadores concibieron un pa s forjado en la preeminencia del di logo sobre la violencia de la libertad sobre la opresi n de la educaci n sobre la ignorancia
704251 la sociedad rural es hoy parte de una vanguardia transformadora
704252 estamos junto a quienes aspiran a integrar una naci n m s justa mejor constituida institucionalmente y m s democr tica en la b squeda de soluciones
704253 juntos hemos compartido esta gesta del campo y del pueblo argentino contra la arbitrariedad y la injusticia
704254 se ores esta ganadera es hist rica el campo est unido esta realidad est aqu para quedarse
704255 acudimos cada vez que nos convoc el gobierno y lo seguiremos haciendo pero seguiremos asistiendo en forma conjunta no aceptaremos m s intentos de disgregaci n

704258 las pol ticas de control de precios y de subsidios al consumo no s lo volvieron a demostrar su ineficacia sin beneficiar al consumidor sino que adem s ahuyentaron la posibilidad de inversi n y con ella una mayor producci n
704259 por no tener soluciones de fondo contra la inflaci n se manipulan los ndices de un instituto tan prestigioso como el indec perjudicando la credibilidad del pa s al consumidor al ama de casa no se la puede enga ar m s
704260 el gobierno parece actuar m s con un criterio de presi n que con vocaci n de aumentar la producci n
704261 en los ltimos tres meses se autoriz la exportaci n de apenas un tercio de los cupos acordados oportunamente con el gobierno son medidas perjudiciales que dan un tiro de gracia a este sector emblem tico
704262 la lecher a tambi n requiere una soluci n de fondo
704263 ahora no se cubren los costos de producci n as se cierran dos o tres tambos por d a
704264 el rey ya no es emperador en su reino es un proveedor de relatos entre otros un candidato m s en el mercado de las noticias los art fices del acontecimiento abren en la reuni n de redacci n los sobres de propuestas y deciden cu l es el mejor seg n sus propios criterios pero el acontecimiento son ellos
704265 el gran desaf o de la industria el campo y el sector financiero es profundizar el modelo para que agregando valor siga dando trabajo mejorando salarios e incorporando innovaci n y tecnolog a
704266 el secretario de comercio interior no define el rol de un gobierno y considero que es reduccionista la conjetura de que tal o cual persona sea la causante de tal o cual problema y la que decide su continuidad o no es la presidenta pero si alguien defiende es porque el otro fue atacado no creo que moreno haya sido atacado as que no tengo por qu defenderlo lo importante de cada funcionario es ver si se desempe a honestamente laboriosamente y eficazmente de acuerdo con lo que emana desde la presidencia
704267 volver a a impulsar la resoluci n 125 de retenciones m viles ya que por primera vez en la argentina las instituciones de la democracia nos pusimos a discutir en serio con posibilidad de ser sancionada una ley que por primera vez tocaba la redistribuci n del ingreso en la argentina
704268 el tema del indec fue manejado pol tica y medi ticamente y en los pa ses vecinos donde los salarios son menores a los de la argentina se registran precios de alimentos mayores y la inflaci n sin embargo da menos que en nuestro pa s
704269 con el debate de las retenciones m viles en el congreso tuvimos la oportunidad por primera vez de discutir c mo redistribuir rentas excepcionales y fue un salto de calidad institucional comparable con la discusi n realizada en la gesti n del ex presidente n stor kirchner sobre la derogaci n de las leyes de obediencia debida y punto final
704270 s lo firm tres renuncias en mi vida a la vicepresidencia en la c mara de diputados de santa cruz como senadora en 1997 y la tercera cuando sub como presidenta
704271 la argentina es un gran lugar para inversiones por ser altamente competitiva 13 000 millones de inversi n en la argentina son de origen extranjero
704272 comparto con el presidente lula da silva la convicci n de que la integraci n es una necesidad absoluta entre ambos pa ses y la llegada del mandatario con una delegaci n de 300 empresarios revela la importancia de la argentina como lugar de inversiones porque es altamente competitiva
704273 muchas veces hemos tratado en estos ltimos a os temas de redistribuci n con la plata del estado con la plata del estado todos son socialistas el tema es ser redistributivo con la renta extra y el problema es el modelo de la concentraci n de la riqueza en un mundo complicado cada vez m s y donde alimentos y energ a requieren de las autoridades y exigen instrumentos para afrontar esa realidad
704274 se estaban discutiendo los t rminos de intercambio y los grados de arancelamiento de importaci n y exportaci n de los pa ses emergentes y los productos industriales fue una discusi n de intereses y hay que ser pragm ticos para no te irlos de ideolog a y lo que ponen los pa ses desarrollados con mayor capital acumulado respecto de nosotros no son a buen negocio para los pa ses emergentes
704275 hemos avanzado mucho porque hay una participaci n plena en el sistema de contralor del gobierno con la aplicaci n de la constituci n nacional la auditor a general la sigen la comisi n revisora de cuentas el parlamento y ustedes los periodistas
704276 no hay un tipo de cambio presidencial sino que estamos ante un r gimen de administraci n por parte del banco central con autonom a que ha permitido acumulaci n de reservas y solidez al sistema financiero
704277 tiene que ser un instrumento de consenso para que todos se sientan representados y hemos mantenido m ltiples reuniones con distintas entidades la coalici n de los 21 puntos entidades art sticas hombres de la cultura para buscar pluralidad y diversidad y hay que preparar el marco regulatorio con la incorporaci n de la tecnolog a
704278 es un tema superado con la modificaci n de la legislaci n adem s nunca he firmado un decreto de necesidad y urgencia a pesar de que son instrumentos avalados desde 1994 por la constituci n nacional
704279 en 2003 dec an que el pusil mine era el ex presidente n stor kirchner y que la que daba las rdenes era yo pero el ex presidente y yo somos dos militantes pol ticos y tal vez resulte dif cil de comprender para la generaci n del posmodernismo pero no para los que nos formamos en un mundo en donde el compromiso pol tico era una actitud de vida
704280 la corte suprema deber a dar directrices de comportamiento para los jueces ya que se habla de c digos blandos y duros de modificaciones de las leyes pero los jueces tienen facultades para negar excarcelaciones teniendo en cuenta la peligrosidad del delincuente
704281 el club de par s nos quiso someter a un plan del fondo monetario internacional la deuda la vamos a abordar oportunamente con serenidad pero en cualquier proceso de renegociaci n es necesario el crecimiento para hacer posible esos compromisos
704282 no me corresponde adjetivar la decisi n del vicepresidente y hay que desdramatizarla porque adem s los roles de la presidenta y el vicepresidente est n perfectamente delimitados por la constituci n y yo tengo mucho respeto por las instituciones
704283 fue una controversia no por conciencia sino por intereses de sectores chicos pero muy poderosos en t rminos econ micos y lo que se ve finalmente es c mo se puede ser funcional a intereses que uno quiere defender y termina actuando en contra de los propios y sectores que se dicen progresistas votaron intereses diferentes
704284 nunca se vio desde el retorno la democracia un nivel de violencia de lockout patronal con cortes de rutas y la afectaci n de otras actividades econ micas y la violencia no fue por parte del gobierno sino por sectores que provocaron la suspensi n entera de turnos de fabrica la suba de precios por falta de mercader a y hasta escenas de pugilato
704285 la lecci n que pude sacar es que fui demasiado ingenua porque no contaba con el poder de sectores que si bien son peque os en n mero son muy fuertes en poder econ mico y creo que deber a haber en todos los sectores de la vida pol tica un gesto de calidad institucional no s lo en el gobierno los sectores que defienden sus propios intereses deber an decirlo a la hora de pedir el voto a la sociedad
704286 la construcci n del tren bala no significa un solo peso de erogaci n por parte del estado nacional sino que se realizar con un pr stamo financiado por bancos franceses el sistema ferroviario fue devastado es dif cil dar buena calidad de servicio con tarifas tan bajas
704287 es normal y serio como debe ser con todos los pa ses del mundo que un afroamericano como el senador barack obama sea candidato por uno de los partidos mayoritarios demuestra por parte del pueblo norteamericano una vitalidad sorprendente y admirable y una cabeza muy abierta
704288 cuando se dec a del hallazgo de una valija con 800 000 d lares para financiar mi campa a electoral respond a los emisarios de estados unidos sobre lo que cre a porque recuerdo los titulares que hablaban de 800 mil d lares para la campa a de la presidenta y respond a los estados unidos
704289 nunca hubo desde 2003 a la fecha un pronunciado crecimiento de la coparticipaci n federal a las provincias como ahora y ello se debi a que el modelo de crecimiento econ mico hizo crecer la recaudaci n y motiv que las provincias tuviesen mucho m s fondos
704290 en el mundo nos admiran por los juicios y castigos contra responsables de cr menes de lesa humanidad aunque preferir a que nos admirasen por otros temas y con los juicios estamos cumpliendo con una deuda con un modo de ver y de vivir que nos debe universalizar a partir de la condici n humana y no tenemos una mirada reduccionista en la defensa de los derechos humanos sea quien sea quien los cometa porque excede las ideolog as
704291 tenemos encuestas diferentes a la consultora poliarqu a diferentes a las publicadas hoy por el diario la naci n que tiene una l nea editorial muy cr tica a esta gesti n y a la anterior aunque no quiero polemizar sobre esta cuesti n
704292 le falt autocr tica a lo largo de toda la conferencia
704293 espero que las conferencias de prensa de cristina sean una rutina el presidente de la sociedad rural habl de la inflaci n es un gran problema
704294 celebro que haya retomado el di logo con la prensa pero lamento profundamente que no haya tenido autocr tica
704295 no hizo menci n ni a los cambios de funcionarios que la sociedad reclama como guillermo moreno ni a temas de tremenda actualidad como la inflaci n la grave situaci n de c rdoba o la realidad de aerol neas argentinas
704296 no fue seria la conferencia por parte de presidenta no tuvo definiciones y es grave que haya ratificado que no va a haber cambios en su gabinete y en su pol tica de gobierno
704297 me llam poderosamente la atenci n que nadie preguntara o que la presidenta omitiera hablar sobre el acto en la rural
704298 creo que la conferencia la arm la presidenta para arrebatarle la tapa de los diarios al campo
704299 a la presidenta le falt autocr tica y sus largos discursos impidieron que todos pudieran preguntar
704300 esta conferencia fue un caso de lo que en las clases de periodismo se ejemplifica con el perro que muerde al hombre no hubo noticia
704301 no hubo novedades no hay cambios de gabinete ni en el indec ni con moreno no dijo nada sobre un tema importante como es la seguridad no se han planteado una verdadera autocr tica de lo sucedido
704302 la idea de la conferencia de prensa me parece positiva pero sobre el tren bala dijo que era un pr stamo como si los pr stamos los pagaran los chinos
704303 s me pareci correcta la respuesta respecto a cobos fue una respuesta positiva
704304 la conferencia tuvo sabor a nada lo m s grave fue que se prohibi la repregunta a los periodistas
704305 que la presidenta contin e sin reconocer la inflaci n como uno de los principales problemas de la poblaci n en especial de los sectores m s pobres
704306 le resulta imposible plantear los actos de gobierno hacia el futuro sobre la soluci n de los verdaderos problemas de la gente como inflaci n inseguridad y la energ a no emite palabra
704307 pens bamos que era n stor pero no son los dos
704308 estamos en el peor de los mundos cristina no hace m s que ratificar lo peor de su gobierno a guillermo moreno y al tren bala
704309 a la vez niega la inflaci n la crisis energ tica y los problemas fiscales tampoco se hace cargo de la inseguridad
704310 cero autocr tica despu s de todo lo que pas no aprendieron nada
704311 el haber debutado con un instrumento de la democracia como es una conferencia de prensa hubiera podido ser un buen momento para la autocr tica en lugar de eso dijo que no cometi ning n error y sostuvo a funcionarios incompetentes no entender la ineficiencia de moreno jaime y de vido es un acto de soberbia imperdonable
704312 si ya no queda decreto de necesidad y urgencia por firmar
704313 la presidenta se hizo un lifting pol tico con la conferencia de prensa
704314 ese no era un proyecto de izquierda era para pagar obligaciones externas y lo reconoci kirchner en la uom por suerte nunca consultamos a cristina kirchner para decidir qu hacemos porque si no hubi ramos acompa ado la privatizaci n de ypf y todo lo que hizo el menemismo
704315 ah queda claro que no hay voluntad de redistribuir el ingreso si quiere ver el costado fiscal habr a que buscar un r gimen tributario m s progresivo
704316 hay una argentina que intenta seguir aferrada al pasado la sociedad rural dici ndoles a los presidentes qu tienen que hacer y un gobierno que pulsea medi ticamente pero no toma decisiones concretas en favor de los que menos tienen
704317 yo esperaba una autocr tica no la hubo sino una fuerte reafirmaci n de los errores que llevaron al conflicto con el campo
704318 detr s de lo dicho sobre el indec y de moreno est que no hay autocr tica sobre el manejo de la pol tica antiinflacionaria
704319 fue una buena idea la conferencia de prensa y ojal no sea un evento aislado sino que se convierta en una pr ctica normal
704320 nunca escuch un acto de arrogancia y soberbia equivalente cuando es capaz de decir que despu s de ocho meses har a de nuevo todo lo que hizo me doy cuenta de que estamos en un problema y grave
704321 basta escucharla para saber que nunca en su vida supo lo que era un ndice de precios ah me asust porque tal vez no es un problema de sinverg enzas sino de ignorancia
704322 cuando se refiere a los superpoderes dice que es una pr ctica com n y eso no es cierto ac cambiaron el 33 por ciento del ltimo presupuesto eso es una caricatura que desconoce las bases del r gimen constitucional
704323 al hablar del tren bala dijo que no nos va a costar nada porque pedimos plata prestada y qui n va a pagar esa deuda eso me pareci incre ble
704324 uno de los m s brillantes intendentes que tuvo la ciudad de buenos aires
704325 demostrar a teresa parodi el m s grande desprecio de los ciudadanos a quien nos ofendi nos atac y nos subestim apoyando la actitud patotera del kirchnerismo
704326 volver a a hacer todas y cada una de las cosas que hice
704327 queremos lanzar un anteproyecto de ley para que sea sometido a discusi n de los distintos sectores involucrados
704328 nunca se vio desde la recuperaci n de la democracia hasta ahora un nivel de virulencia de lockout patronal y cortes que impidieron el abastecimiento originaron suspensiones de f bricas y hasta escenas de pugilato sobre las rutas hubo escraches a legisladores y a sus familiares la virulencia no fue por parte del gobierno no hab a ning n funcionario cortando rutas de nuestro lado todo fue manejado institucionalmente evitando cualquier episodio de violencia
704329 cuando se sancion la actual ley de radiodifusi n durante la dictadura lo m s moderno que exist a en la argentina era la televisi n a color ni siquiera hab a fax la realidad requiere de un instrumento que d cuenta no s lo de las demandas de pluralidad y de actuaci n de todos los sectores culturales comunitarios p blicos y privados sino tambi n preparar el marco regulatorio para la incorporaci n de la tecnolog a tenemos que recurrir a una legislaci n comparada no vamos a inventar nada nuevo en un mundo donde ya se ha trabajado mucho
704330 estamos trabajando y hay much simos instrumentos la cgt ha planteado otros pero una asignaci n universal familiar o de cualquier tipo tiene que tener los recursos para ser pagada si no se convierte en un discurso demag gico que tanto han ayudado a descreer en la pol tica
704331 esto comienza a presionar sobre los precios internos porque se quiere tener un mayor excedente exportable por parte de aquellos que producen los alimentos para poder ganar m s dinero
704332 no podemos volver a ser un granero del mundo sin valor agregado tenemos que reindustrializar el pa s
704333 yo siempre digo que con la plata del estado todos son socialistas esos son fondos tributarios que el estado toma de todos sus contribuyentes los que tienen trabajo los que no los que tienen plata los que no el problema es ser un poco m s distributivo como lo hacen en otras sociedades m s modernas desarrolladas y progresistas all la renta de aquellos sectores que tienen un mayor nivel de rentabilidad se distribuye hacia los sectores que menos tienen
704334 tal vez la lecci n o la autocr tica que deber a hacerme es cierto grado de ingenuidad ante la afectaci n de lo que yo considero son privilegios
704335 esta es una discusi n que podr retardarse demorarse o fracasar en una instancia legislativa pero que necesariamente deber ser retomada como un instrumento de pol tica econ mica
704336 se ha disparado una discusi n que va a seguir porque el problema del modelo econ mico de la concentraci n de la riqueza de un mundo cada vez m s complicado por los alimentos y energ a va a exigir a las autoridades sea esta presidenta o el que venga instrumentos muy importantes
704337 estuviste tres veces en el sal n blanco compartiendo actos conmigo sobre el tema en discusi n y nunca me dijiste que estuvieras en de sacuerdo
704338 la integraci n es una necesidad para los dos pa ses
704339 la dirigencia de palermo confunde el cumplimiento de reglas con trabas controles con pol ticas arbitrarias siguen defendiendo la informalidad en el campo y los mecanismos de elusi n fiscal cuestionan la resoluci n 543 de la oncca porque ha sido la nica herramienta efectiva con la que pudimos r pidamente combatir la elusi n fiscal que les permite la ley de granos que dise mart nez de hoz para salvaguardar la especulaci n de las grandes exportadoras de cereales
704340 a para sos fiscales como m naco islas v rgenes e islas caim n
704341 sac su considerable miembro y sacudi ndolo le dijo esta es raz n esta
704342 no entiendo por qu uno habr a de odiar a gente a la que ni siquiera respeta
704343 porque hago preguntas como si fuera un ama de casa de des moines
704344 y tienen raz n dice thomas porque eso es lo que la naci n quiere saber y sa es la mejor forma que tenemos de contribuir al bien com n
704345 la identificaci n de los medios con el ciudadano y con un inter s general la de safecci n partidista la decreciente deferencia ante la clase pol tica el rol vigilante la personalizaci n o la reducci n de las categor as pol ticas a las reglas de la moral privada
704346 efectos sobre la salud del sistema pol tico y la gobernabilidad son controvertidos
704347 i believe declining water quality will be one of the biggest issues facing this country and the world in the coming years adequate supplies of clean water is critical for both human and wildlife populations
704348 ground and surface water resources are being threatened by excessive extraction chemical contamination nutrient loading and other forms of pollution the coastal and marine aquatic habitats are also under pressure from a variety of activities including shipping petroleum exploration and extraction over fishing and aquaculture
704349 poder podr a recuperar imagen pero tendr a que cambiar algo que no est cambiando en principio la actitud de estar en conflicto con una parte de la sociedad es algo que debe cambiar s o s la actitud de los kirchner se concentra en no rendirse triunfar cuando en realidad lo que pide la opini n p blica es que administre el consenso el otro aspecto clave es que avance en la macroeconom a en concreto la inflaci n y el crecimiento insisto la opini n p blica no pide que derroten a alguien sino que gestionen si la actitud no cambia tal vez remonten un poco pero no a los niveles anteriores
704350 hay mucha manipulaci n de encuestas en oposici n al gobierno nacional
704351 es posible requiere tener un claro diagn stico de por qu se perdieron niveles anteriores de confianza e imagen los temas centrales son el sinceramiento de la situaci n socioecon mica reconocer que los precios est n subiendo en lugar de decir que no es verdad eso genera falta de credibilidad y confianza el gobierno necesita que los precios bajen plantearse metas inflacionarias claras con eso resolver a la falta de credibilidad y sobre todo un tema important simo que es el bolsillo de la poblaci n la inflaci n afecta a los sectores medios y bajos el otro aspecto central es la apertura al di logo que sea fruct fero que incorpore al otro e incorpore las opiniones del otro que baje las tensiones cuando se plante el acuerdo del bicentenario se supon a justamente eso la idea de consensuar traducido eso significa que si antes de establecer las retenciones no hablo con los ruralistas y lo mismo ocurre con todos los sectores el estilo no es el de buscar consensos el otro elemento que debo se alar es que los sectores populares tienen que sentirse m s protegidos el gobierno debe dar se ales de que entiende sus problemas y que quien hable les hable a los sectores populares con un discurso c lido y entendible para los sectores populares
704352 creo que el gobierno privilegia el poder antes que la imagen b sicamente la administraci n kirchner est m s interesada en dar se ales de que mantiene el poder que en dar se ales que generen simpat a en la opini n p blica la actitud m s bien confrontativa con el campo y con julio cobos no es lo que la opini n p blica prefiere pero es como kirchner da se ales claras de que mantiene el poder yo como consultor aconsejar a lo contrario pero no soy consultor de kirchner ni soy kirchner la l gica de kirchner es que el di logo puede ser interpretado como debilidad y lo mismo va respecto de un cambio de gabinete muchos de nosotros lo interpretar amos como una jugada h bil en el estilo k se toma como un signo de debilidad por eso creo que la pregunta no apunta al coraz n de la estrategia kirchnerista no es retomar niveles de imagen sino afirmar poder
704353 los registros disponibles a nivel nacional no permiten hablar de un deterioro importante en los niveles de apoyo pol tico y evaluaci n de desempe o que tengan su causa en la crisis del campo los instrumentos para lograr una recuperaci n de la iniciativa son simples apertura franca y honesta al mensaje de la opini n publica apuesta decidida hacia mayor apertura y transversalismo transpartidario compromiso responsable con la innovaci n menos emergencia y m s estado de derecho apertura al mundo y resistencia clara frente a la tentaci n corporatista que es un fantasma recurrente para la tradici n pol tica del peronismo
704354 la oposici n sigue sorprendiendo por sus dificultades para una lectura clara de lo que ocurre en el pa s vuelvo a los registros semanales de opini n p blica y se alo adem s su incapacidad consiguiente para capitalizar pol ticamente las dificultades del gobierno priman la improvisaci n el dogmatismo y sobre todo la cerraz n frente a cualquier esfuerzo de cooperaci n en general los lideres de oposici n ceden a la tentaci n de la presencia medi tica que les exige exageraci n intolerancia y gestos apocal pticos divorciados por completo de las demandas efectivas de la gente emergen figuras interesantes m s all de los binner cobos carri o macri hay una docena de nuevas figuras parlamentarias y veinte o treinta intendentes con mucho futuro pero faltan ideas compromiso energ a y propuestas medianamente acordes con el talante de oposici n de los sectores medios de la sociedad argentina en este sentido los medios de comunicaci n y algunos periodistas siguen siendo la nica oposici n efectiva lo cual implica un verdadero callej n por el momento sin salida la dirigencia del campo estableci una alianza de gran eficiencia con los medios de comunicaci n y ello le permiti hasta el momento imponer sus reclamos sectoriales ello no basta para configurar una alternativa pol tica existe una amplia minor a social de alrededor del 25 o 30 por ciento de la sociedad que sigue buscando sin encontrar una fuerza pol tica moderada que la contenga la represente y la exprese en t rminos electorales un voto que sigue vagando en busca de dirigentes y partidos que no aparecen
704355 el campo no es oposici n es un actor social que le viene muy bien a la oposici n yo a la oposici n la sigo viendo muy desorganizada pese a la oportunidad que tiene se necesitan liderazgos innovadores desde schiaretti hasta binner buscan encarnar proyectos alternativos a partir de sus respectivas gestiones pero est claro que el proyecto tiene que ser productivo federalista frente al redistributivo centralista que encarnan los kirchner puede ser un eje para la oposici n pero hoy est n desmembrados y no s si lo perciben
704356 tenemos una encuesta sobre eso la capitalizaci n opositora del desgaste oficialista en total entrevistamos a 861 personas en el polo peronista de la sota sigue sin existir como en 2003 sin menciones felipe sol y carlos reutemann con el 9 2 y el 8 por ciento de las menciones respectivamente por debajo de las expectativas y sobre todo de la impronta medi tica de sus figuras en especial el ex gobernador bonaerense eduardo duhalde con el 28 2 de las preferencias a pesar de su mala imagen p blica 63 7 negativa sigue funcionando como la opci n peronista realmente existente al gobierno nacional en el polo no peronista lilita con el 11 por ciento de las preferencias y a pesar de su gran exposici n no logra capitalizar la crisis oficial y aparece nuevamente con serias dificultades para constituirse en opci n al gobierno nacional mauricio macri hermes binner y julio c sar cobos con el 11 9 y 8 respectivamente apenas se recortan como figuras alternativas aunque en el caso de cleto su instalaci n resulta notable partiendo de su piso anterior realmente inexistente finalmente la segunda opci n con el 13 por ciento de las menciones la constituye la categor a no hay desgaste que probablemente exprese m s que la negaci n de lo evidente la permanencia de una masa de apoyo al gobierno nacional respaldo que puede sorprender tanto por su estrechez como por su extensi n seg n se lea los l deres del sector agro aparecen como los ganadores de una fuerte disputa sectorial y eso les asigna popularidad coyuntural aunque ninguno de ellos en especial el de mayor visibilidad alfredo de angeli logr superar el 75 por ciento de imagen positiva que obten a juan carlos blumberg en los d as de plomo
704357 no hay una visualizaci n de la oposici n est claro que existe un mapa en el que aparecen por un lado binner carri y luis juez por otro lado un sector del peronismo y en tercer lugar el macrismo desde el punto de vista del peso en la opini n p blica est n muy desdibujados el clima de opini n en la clase media les fue dando un rol que no fueron ellos los que lo buscaron a la gente hubo cosas que no le gustaron apareci la protesta social y ah se hizo el entronque con personalidades opositoras si el gobierno no logra credibilidad la oposici n va a existir porque el electorado as lo har efectivo no porque haya una propuesta alternativa hoy las cr ticas al plan econ mico las hacen m s los economistas que los pol ticos incluso es un debate acotado cu nto se crece que puede haber problemas dentro de dos a os la realidad es que cada figura busca su lugar de existencia carri seguramente har buen pie en las legislativas de capital pero tiene muchas limitaciones en la opini n p blica cuando se habla de cargos ejecutivos macri y binner se apoyan en sus gestiones yo dir a que el mayor peligro para el gobierno y el peronismo es que se siga desgajando el frente interno
704358 la vuelta al estado de una empresa descapitalizada endeudada y con un aumento del veinte por ciento en la plantilla de personal desde que fuera privatizada
704359 con el sueldo m nimo o las asignaciones les ponemos dinero en el bolsillo a los que consumen lo esencial para vivir si aliviamos la carga en ganancias mejoraremos a los que tienen mayor capacidad de gasto los que pueden acelerar m s la inflaci n
704360 un ejemplo de patr n de desarrollo inherentemente regresivo en materia redistributiva fue el de frondizi impulsor de las industrias capital intensivas mezquinas ya en la creaci n de empleos de origen predominantemente extranjero y que les vend an sus productos iron as de la historia a las clases medias urbanas consolidadas en su prosperidad por el peronismo y el mejor ejemplo de un patr n de desarrollo inherentemente progresivo en la distribuci n pero a la vez transitorio y excepcional es el del primer peronismo porque la industria que motorizaba el crecimiento era nacional trabajo intensiva esto es generosa en la creaci n de empleos y le vend a sus productos a una sociedad todav a homog nea y de altos salarios
704361 el agro sostiene con sus divisas el d ficit estructural de divisas de toda la industria de modo que no habr a industria sin agro pero habr a agro sin industria ahora bien la existencia de un sector competitivo y din mico no resuelve la cuesti n distributiva justamente la gran pregunta a contestarse es qu oferta se puede hacer desde ese agro modernizado a la gran masa de marginados por la quiebra de la sustituci n de importaciones que hoy se concentra en las periferias urbanas y sobre todo en el gran buenos aires

704373 las funciones del tribunal penal internacional para la ex yugoslavia van declinando y concluir n el a o 2010 por eso desde hace tiempo recibe cada vez menos recursos para investigar los cr menes de guerra o los cr menes contra la humanidad o el genocidio hasta ahora ha enjuiciado a 115 acusados y todav a hay 46 casos juzg ndose el riesgo a que nos enfrentamos es que algunos casos no lleguen a ser enjuiciados o no puedan tener apelaci n antes del 2010 podr a ocurrir que karadzic no cumpliera todas las instancias judiciales qu ocurr a entonces con esos casos y con los criminales que a n permanecen libres que pasar an a los tribunales nacionales de serbia bosnia y croacia pero amnist a internacional siente graves preocupaciones por la falta de imparcialidad de estos tribunales y porque no han perseguido a los criminales por eso estamos pidiendo que se ampl e el per odo del tribunal y que se le proporcionen los recursos econ micos necesarios

704390 damit einverstanden dass wolfgang clement nicht aus der spd ausgeschlossen wird
704391 erwartet dass er erkl rt seine parteisch digenden aufrufe zur nichtwahl der spd in zukunft zu unterlassen
704392 ich lasse mich nicht festlegen wann wie und wo ich zuk nftig meine meinung u ern werde
704393 nach wie vor eine solidarische l sung innerhalb unserer sozialdemokratischen familie
704394 wir sollten uns wolfgang clement als querdenker vorstellen dieses attribut ist in unserer partei sympathischerweise kein schimpfwort ein querulant ist er aber gewiss nicht
704395 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas
704396 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the army let the injured enter
704397 with regret and unfortunately i have to say that i am the main bookseller in afghanistan
704398 there will be a crisis of books if something happens to us or if we collapse so it is very important that we have others involved in this too
704399 through books our kids would know about their culture history and understand the world books are like seas you have to dive into the sea to get the pearl you have to read books to know how to solve your countrys problems
704400 googles approach works better for some languages and worse for others but at least google can expand to other languages without having to know them and manually create models for each one
704401 i couldnt see a clear winner yet though i get the feeling googles results are slightly superior but a lot of garbage results on both ends
704402 we are reorienting the company around where we can grow
704403 if we can do a better job of understanding who these customers are and answering their questions we will grow
704404 there are no plans to pull the plug on teoma our core search engine technology
704405 earlier this afternoon i learned that ask com is taking the company in a new and different direction and i will not be a part of it
704406 its time to move forward and on to another full time job where it will be and what i will do is tbd but i am looking forward to seeing whats out there and where i might be able to contribute
704407 after the occupation refused to receive most of those who fled gaza dozens have returned and the palestinian police have taken them into custody
704408 we are discussing with the israelis how to allow the people to return to gaza
704409 they hamas wanted some people from this area but we refused to hand them over
704410 they attacked the area and fired rockets and grenades at us many were killed and wounded
704411 for at fors ge at f bugt med de kriminelle handlinger
704412 state of drinking how our love of alcohol shapes wisconsins cultural landscape
704413 es ist essenzieller bestandteil der sozialen marktwirtschaft dass entgelte dem wahren wert einer leistung entsprechen m ssen
704414 eklatante missverh ltnisse und berh hte entlohnungen trotz offenkundiger schlechtleistung d rfen nicht mit dem hinweis auf die kr fte des freien marktes honoriert werden
704415 i tried my best and im very impressed by how the low scores have been this week it was a great win for ji yai
704416 i kept it together pretty well today but i was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes
704417 i was pleased to play well and to break 70 for the first time this week i just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship
704418 i saw a sign on the scoreboard saying annika you will be missed and then i was greeted with all the applause
704419 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
704420 the absence of choice is a circumstance that is very very rare
704421 the march 8 election was a warning to them to act quickly and take steps to tackle issues like rising costs and crime restoring the judiciary and bringing equitable development for all
704422 but the bn has not only lost its sense of priorities it has also lost its direction
704423 no estar propiciando una suerte de insurrecci n o golpe de estado sino expresando su honda preocupaci n p blicamente
704424 este es el momento de darle un parao al jefe de estado y al gobierno porque no se puede aceptar y esto lo digo enf ticamente que se cambie la estructura militar venezolana a espaldas del pueblo eso debe producir una reacci n contundente de los venezolanos
704425 tipifica un soberano exabrupto y abuso que inclusive rompe con la constituci n nacional
704426 porque sencillamente no estamos en emergencia y menos en un estado excepci n
704427 la sociedad venezolana tendr que aplicar los correctivos que la misma constituci n nacional establece para hacerle ver que est equivocado y que por tanto debe cambiar
704428 los ciudadanos debemos valernos de la carta magna para poder hacer respetar nuestros derechos porque en una democracia lo m s importante es que las decisiones pol ticas tienen que ser aceptadas por el pueblo que a fin de cuentas es a quien representa el poder constituido
704429 porque por puro capricho de ch vez transformaba a la fan de instituci n armada defensiva en ofensiva y adem s permit a la participaci n de tropas venezolanas en el extranjero y que tropas extranjeras operaran en territorio nacional a pedido y decisi n de l exclusivamente
704430 y lo ha focalizado solamente como una problem tica de los militares activos y de algunos militares retirados que opinan a nivel nacional
704431 aqu lo se est conformando es la reedici n del nacional socialismo que en el pasado gener tantos problemas en europa
704432 lo que es necesario entender es que en venezuela se est construyendo un sistema de gobierno muy parecido al de adolfo hitler en la alemania nazi y al fascista de benito mussolini en italia antes de la segunda guerra mundial
704433 quiz s por desconocimiento le dieron vida y propiciaron la beligerancia con esos gobiernos que luego resultaron infames para la sociedad
704434 lo que por v a electoral fue rechazado mayoritariamente por el pueblo ahora se pretende hacer con las leyes de la habilitante
704435 y cuando tengamos tropas venezolanas combatiendo en otros pa ses o militares extranjeros actuando en nuestro pa s ser muy tarde para reaccionar
704436 este es el momento de darle un parao al jefe de estado y al gobierno porque no se puede aceptar y esto lo digo enf ticamente que se cambie la estructura militar venezolana a espaldas del pueblo eso debe producir una reacci n contundente de los venezolanos
704437 why dont we do anything in the field of product development and creation why do we invariably have to wait for them to create and wait like hungry hyenas and vultures waiting for lion to leave the carnal remains for us to consume
704438 dont attempt something if u know that there is even a slightest possibility of failure
704439 solving change requests better known as crs in indian it lingo raised by a dumb business user sitting somewhere in his corner office in the states or europe

704441 if its worth knowing it the donkey makes sure it reaches you
704442 today we are in an environment where we may not need the large number or persistence of manned aircraft
704443 we can put unmanned aircraft predator reaper and other assets overhead for long endurance periods we call that persistent stare
704444 and with the reaper armed with hellfire and 500 pound precision weapons well be able to have a deadly stare if needed
704445 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
704446 so my task is to figure out which asset you use where and why to get the best effect in the battlespace
704447 the thing about unmanned aerial vehicles is they can stay overhead for a long time and not use a lot of gas
704448 there are periods where weve gone a week to ten days without having to release a single kinetic attack and that is a real success story
704449 will we need to have manned kinetic capability to respond either with overhead or ground alert the answer is yes for a period of time
704450 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
704451 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
704452 we think its got a lot of humour in it were having fun and enjoying it
704453 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
704454 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
704455 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from eight to 80
704456 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
704457 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
704458 be civil to all sociable to many familiar with few friend to one enemy to none
704459 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
704460 make safeguarding womens rights under roe v wade a priority
704461 obama will secure all loose nuclear materials in the world within four years
704462 there is no more joy in it because all it is is a living to you

704468 i saw an old women who lost two legs and a hand she was bleeding and later died before our eyes but we could do nothing as we ourselves needed help
704469 we do not have enough doctors and enough operational theaters it takes some time before all patients get access to emergency treatment
704470 they are lying in the corridors and some bled to death
704471 the speech will be a formality about the u s engagement with asia especially on security and economic engagement
704472 america has three key words promote democracy security and the economy in asia protocol wise he cannot declare any significant policies since this is his last speech
704473 stop interfering in chinas internal affairs under the pretext of human rights and religious issues and avoid damage to china u s relations
704474 gay marriage causes global warming only because we are so hot
704475 programs in the public schools for children from birth through age eight

704478 of relating to or constituting a political group associated with views practices and policies of extreme change
704479 advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs
704480 there are plans to evacuate all children whose parents give their consent
704481 there is no doubt that the separatists leaders received orders to prevent the process of peaceful resolution through the active participation of the international community
704482 in fact the youths are going to vacation in youth camps as usually happens in the summer and this is being put forth as an evacuation
704483 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
704484 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
704485 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
704486 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
704487 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
704488 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
704489 the no gun ri incident became one of the milestones to take on this kind of incident in the future
704490 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
704491 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were air strikes
704492 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
704493 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
704494 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
704495 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
704496 how could they not tell the cows the pieces of furniture
704497 this is a matter of deep concern to the korean people
704498 the killings of korean civilians were extensive intentional and indiscriminate
704499 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time

704513 the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
704514 for the past two months there have been radically different data such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that make us think that the economic situation is worse than we had all predicted
704515 if there are no more surprises on oil prices if there are no other variables that have a negative impact we think that we will have much lower growth or flat growth in the coming quarters but we are not thinking of a recession
704516 if oil prices stabilise from september we could begin to see a drop in inflation at the end of the year it could be around 4 0 percent or less

704577 before brett favre or even the magic man it was hard to find anyone in wisconsin who owned anything in packer colors other than a t shirt or hat which would have been covered by a huge blue parka or a one piece orange or red deer hunting outfit
704578 i do know if i am going to play this year i need to get in camp i would love to play again everyone says brett go play my question is where
704579 they cannot sell anything with my name on it thats a big deal to them its just like an endorsement with nike we have been working on that deal for some time
704580 all i can say is the commissioner is involved and both sides are trying to resolve this quickly i think everyone both sides are stressed out
704581 the good thing is the commissioner is involved and he will try to resolve this in the best fashion he would like me to play

704591 what a way to go life at the end of empire
704592 tim and i work our way through the myriad of emotions that come with staring down the world situation as we dig into ourselves always beneath what might have been termed depression we find feelings we discover that when we identify and express those feelings the emotional grey goo of depression eventually dissipates and along the way we discover strong and courageous parts of ourselves that have been dormant
704593 michael panzner is definitely not from the left end of the political spectrum which makes the contents of financial armageddon all the more fascinating and momentous i came away from the book with both remarkable reinforcement of my position that the united states has entered economic collapse but also perplexed regarding the myriad blind spots that the author seemed to have regarding the causes of the current economic meltdown i am not aware of how panzner may have altered his views since the publication of his book earlier this year but at the time of writing panzner did not mention or was not aware of a number of glaring realities regarding the gluttonous greed fest that has characterized the united states since the end of world war ii i will address those inconsistencies first then highlight the places where i think financial armageddon is absolutely on target what is most disturbing to me about the book is what appears to be a total lack of perception regarding the role of fraud theft and malicious intent in the american and global financial train wreck which has been exacerbating over recent decades panzner seems to conclude that all of this is just one huge accident attributable to incompetence or the american consumer being lulled by creature comforts the book begins with a chapter on debt personal and governmental a factor so pivotal in economic catastrophe but little attention is given to the intentional engineering for example of consumer debt by centralized financial systems and how monstrously profitable it is maxed out
704594 ever growing investment returns an endless housing boom and the federal reserve had conditioned americans to believe that inevitable good fortune would eventually bail them out should it even prove necessary
704595 even though they knew a day of reckoning would come
704596 in the wake of the early 21st century housing boom the migratory landing points may well be the millions of condominiums and boarded up new homes left empty or mired in foreclosure in what were once the hottest real estate markets
704597 who will increasingly be seen as an unacceptable threat to national security
704598 americans will be confronted by an unfamiliar and frightening array of legal financial and security restrictions including lockdowns curfews internments capital and exchange controls and even oh yes especially martial law

704602 what have we become that we have allowed this to happen
704603 you should find ways to spread your message far and wide if you dont youre just preaching to the choir
704604 recognize the crisis for what it is and start from scratch
704605 only the small secrets need to be protected the big ones are kept secret by public incredulity
704606 i have made a deliberate choice in using the terms fascist tactics and fascist shift when i describe some events in america now i stand by my choice i am not being heated or even rhetorical i am being technical
704607 range of authoritarian regimes dictatorships and varieties of fascist states there are many shades of gray on the spectrum from an open to a closed society
704608 fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
704609 these men and women were radicals for liberty that they had a vision of equality that was a slap in the face of what the rest of their world understood to be the unchanging god given order of nations and that they were wiling to die to make that desperate vision into a reality for people like us whom they would never live to see
704610 get back in the car stop where you are get back in the car
704611 never get out of your car when youre dealing with a police officer
704612 we on the left must snap out of our torpor we have to reengage in an old fashioned commitment to democratic action and believe once again in an old fashioned notion of the republic we need to help lead a democracy movement in america like the ones that have toppled repressive regimes overseas
704613 democracy movement in america like the ones that have toppled repressive regimes overseas
704614 which is forcing us to create the kind of world we wanted all the time anyway
704615 it is caught between a rock and a hard place the fed will stand pat
704616 its the most natural way to allow the ecosystem to perpetuate itself
704617 we dont put a blindfold on and look the other way
704618 but when such a fire does encounter one of those areas where theyve done prescribed burns itll change its intensity itll drop to the ground and allow firefighters to get a handle on it
704619 the old policy was to put the fire out as quickly as possible keep it to the smallest size the shortest duration
704620 thats not humanly possible any more in the midst of climate change invasive weeds urban sprawl and a lot of careless recreationists
704621 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses
704622 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
704623 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
704624 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
704625 miss hilton was neither asked nor did she give permission for the use of her likeness in the ad and has no further comment
704626 s epic domestic box office record of 600 million but maintaining the top spot three weeks in a row is an impressive feat especially in todays crowded marketplace back in 1998 james camerons film stayed at no 1 for 15 consecutive weeks
704627 but it comes in a lull in the campaign june and july you know the primary is over it tends to get a little dull usually the negative ads havent appeared yet and so its sort of a perfect time to begin the guessing game
704628 if theres anything is some guys closet some local reporter who has covered this person for eight or 12 or 16 years might know about and might it get out before the candidate has committed to an embarrassing choice
704629 we dont even know if they candidates have really decided some of the names floated now are the candidates being nice to people who have no chance but floating their names helps them with their local constituents
704630 i cant comment on the process that were going through i apologize for being so obtuse
704631 when we start commenting you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
704632 i think particularly someone like barack obama who is such a controlling politician and works so hard to make sure that everything is leak proof i imagine he probably has led us completely astray and might have a really explosive surprise in store because thats the way he wants to be
704633 will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
704634 we fully understand why traditional debates are part of the presidential campaign cycle
704635 the unique opportunity to combine input from the american people 21st century technology powered by google youtube and a venue like new orleans
704636 and when he obama mentioned president george w bush and mccain have no real answers if you really believe that youre running against a guy with no answers to americas challenges why wont you debate him
704637 wie durch ein strafgericht werden sich alle weltverh ltnisse ndern die wutentbrannten stolzen listigen untertanen werden sich gegen ihre herren emp ren fast alle m chtigen und gro en werden grausam gepl ndert ihres ansehens ihrer macht beraubt und get tet werden nach seinem gutd nken wird sich das volk sodann einen k nig w hlen pr sident kanzler staatschef man kann das volk nimmer beschwichtigen im gegenteil es wird ber alle gro en der erde herfallen und die ganze erde pl ndern

704643 the right knowledge at the right place at the right time
704644 its great to have the schedule out early for next year having entered this season with a limited amount of preparation this will enable us to be much more prepared for 2009
704645 it wasnt as easy as it looked i pushed really hard in the beginning especially
704646 in 1998 1999 trials anwar experienced the phenomenon of fabrication of dna evidence we had sac rodwan illegally removing dna samples from forensic custody in cross examination of the prosecutions witnesses it was exposed that dna taken from blood samples was planted on the infamous mattress
704647 when confronted with this fact the prosecution amended its charge and persuaded the judge augustine paul to expunge the entire dna evidence from the record preventing anwars lawyers from responding
704648 prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi wants the police to charge anwar while the cabinet is against it

704669 i am touched by the support i am seeing i promise to clean up this country of all the corruption and other wrongdoing once we take over
704670 its time the government realised that the people are sick of them we need change
704671 i am sad to leave my constituency after ten years but it is for the greater good of this country when anwar steps into parliament
704672 we look forward to the election as we need to get the message to the government that we need a new leader
704673 if umno barisan nasional decide to play rough with massive funding and bribery then we will have to be really prepared
704674 how rough they want to play and how is the election commission going to conduct the elections these issues we are going to study
704675 it is not a question of facts and law the arrest will be a political decision
704676 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times mr rudd told the nine network yesterday
704677 this is a complex social issue and as a government we are working to combat alcohol related harm right across the victorian community
704678 this cant go on until september people will want an indication from him sooner than that
704679 he knows that the majority of the party wants him back now theres no reason for him to be silent any longer
704680 hes come back from overseas he must have made his mind up by now
704681 in the face of eternity not every little thing matters
704682 they said oral sex is a crime i hope they will go to the police really
704683 the moment i declare my candidacy for a higher post i am sure someone will lodge a oral sex report against me they have already warned me against contesting i said they can go ahead and report me to the police
704684 this shows that it sex dvd is a political conspiracy an mca internal conspiracy as they political opponents are very concerned about my personal problems and conduct
704685 you did not ask who is the mastermind behind this make a guess who will benefit from all these i am 90 sure of who did it the sex dvd except i lack the evidence
704686 i encourage them to lodge police reports people have seen all of me what is there to be afraid of i only want to tell mca the elections have become a slugfest
704687 i am a politician i leave it to the members to decide my political destiny i know that when i declare my intention to contest party posts others will use the dvd against me
704688 no one is perfect every leader has some kind of scandals except they are not exposed and debated in the open
704689 some say your scandal is your personal problem and what is important is you are not corrupt and have not abused your power
704690 one is that i should be evaluated on performance and regard my conduct as something personal as long as my family accepts me no one else should interfere the other deems my private life more important than my performance
704691 i believe mca central delegates have the wisdom to pick the right leaders and will not allow a leader to be run down by the action of certain despicable people
704692 this story makes me very uncomfortable and uh proud to be an american
704693 this is the first time in my life that i have felt i am actually doing something about what the democrats have done in the past and are doing now to black people
704694 if the democrats had left us alone after the republicans freed us from slavery we wouldnt be having this discussion today they are keeping blacks in virtual slavery
704695 the leader of the sarasota based national black republican association
704696 you have people like michael moore going into foreign countries saying americans are the stupidest people in the world i want to tell the real america story that america is a force for good
704697 thus said hashem whoever remains in this city will die by the sword by the famine or by the pestilence whereas whoever goes out in surrender to the chaldeans will live he will have his life as a booty and he will live
704698 thus said hashem this city will surely be delivered into the hand of the army of the king of babylonia and he will capture it
704699 let this man be put to death now because he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who remain in this city and the hands of all the people by speaking to them such things for this man does not seek the welfare of this people but rather their detriment
704700 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realized when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimeter piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
704701 well none of these miracles could have happened so all of it is junk
704702 have i then become your enemy because i tell you the truth
704703 the new testament is hidden in the old and the old testament is revealed in the new
704704 unless the lord builds the house those who build it labor in vain unless the lord watches over the city the watchman stays awake in vain
704705 if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and foundation of the truth
704706 it is the bible which is the pillar and foundation of truth
704707 and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
704708 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you and lo i am with you always to the close of the age
704709 and i will ask the father and he will give you another advocate to dwell with you forever the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him but you shall know him because he will dwell with you and be in you
704710 now to him who by the power at work within us is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations for ever and ever
704711 he who does not believe the son makes him a liar because he does not believe the witness that god has borne concerning the son
704712 wives should be subordinate to their husbands as to the lord for the husband is head of his wife just as christ is head of the church he himself the savior of the body
704713 so in the present case i tell you keep away from these men and let them alone for if this plan or this undertaking is of men it will fail but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them you might even be found opposing god
704714 unless the lord builds the house those who build it labor in vain unless the lord watches over the city the watchman stays awake in vain
704715 and i tell you you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
704716 to be deep in history is to cease to be protestant
704717 i appeal to you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment
704718 so if there is any encouragement in christ any incentive of love any participation in the spirit any affection and sympathy complete my joy by being of the same mind having the same love being in full accord and of one mind
704719 and i have other sheep that are not of this fold i must bring them also and they will heed my voice so there shall be
704720 and i will pray the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows him you know him for he dwells with you and will be in you
704721 for in the first place when you assemble as a church i hear that there are divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized
704722 guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the holy spirit who dwells within us
704723 this is my body which is being given for you do this in remembrance of me
704724 i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any one eats of this bread he will live for ever and the bread which i shall give for the life of the world is my flesh
704725 he who hears you hears me and he who rejects you rejects me and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me
704726 peace be with you as the father has sent me even so i send you
704727 receive the holy spirit if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven if you retain the sins of any they are retained
704728 he who believes in the son has eternal life he who does not obey the son shall not see life but the wrath of god rests upon him
704729 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of those men who in their wickedness hold back the truth of god
704730 for he will render to every man according to his works to those who by patience in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality he will give eternal life but for those who are factious and do not obey the truth but obey wickedness there will be wrath and fury
704731 the coming of the lawless one by the activity of satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders and with all wicked deception for those who are to perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved therefore god sends upon them a strong delusion to make them believe what is false so that all may be condemned who do not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness but we are bound to give thanks to god always for you brethren beloved by the lord because god chose you from the beginning to be saved through sanctification by the spirit and belief in the truth
704732 if anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our lord jesus christ and the teaching which accords with godliness he is puffed up with conceit he knows nothing he has a morbid craving for controversy and for disputes about words which produce envy dissension slander base suspicions and wrangling among men who are depraved in mind and bereft of the truth imagining that godliness is a means of gain
704733 and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all things to myself
704734 our money says he doesnt look much like me but when i get elected it will
704735 the lincoln on a five spot is white and old abe just wasnt too bright he couldnt foresee a messiah like me ill replace him with reverend wright
704736 then theres the one dollar vex and the slave master washington hex so i say no no to all washington dough and mint with malcolm x
704737 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
704738 in 1974 as well as 1992 candidate clinton has actually embraced powerful corporate interests and much of their agenda despite his rhetoric against them
704739 110th on the fortune 500 list and sold 6 000 products in 57 countries from fresh chickens to taco fillings
704740 the chairman don tyson is a colorful figure who in the late 1970s designed his corporate office as a replica of the oval office in the white house with doorknobs shaped like chicken eggs
704741 the tyson clinton relationship continued in washington of course and it grew out of a special culture
704742 i think the mccain campaign has just been handed their next commercial
704743 if you love me you will obey what i command
704744 i think the mccain campaign has just been handed their next commercial
704745 has there ever been a more evil woman than nancy pelosi
704746 nothings going to dislodge him unless he commits a major felony
704747 today immigrants come here to steal from us and send home to strengthen their own
704748 come here to steal from us and send home to strengthen their own
704749 no no i tuned it at our piano at home
704750 no no its all tuned i tuned it at home
704751 weve been in his presence weve felt of his personality we know that what he is telling us is true
704752 and im going to be retiring very shortly from the company im with ive done very well and we plan to go out on a mission together
704753 this amazing church has woven a pattern of miracles in our lives
704754 weve talked about how we are in our late 70s now these two old people wandering around in africa having the greatest period of our lives the greatest excitement we could have
704755 you cant find the word retirement in the bible i dont think you can find the word in the bible dictionary isnt it interesting to think what can happen in our lives today and what possibilities lie ahead for us if we believe and understand and have a commitment and a dedication to live the principles of the gospel of jesus christ and to bless the lives of people
704756 why theyre lying is probably as varied as individuals are varied
704757 halfway through a survey they might all of a sudden get nervous about the kinds of questions theyre being asked and start to lie or not be totally straightforward
704758 still polling being a science the practioners have a vareity of methods they use to screen out those who might be lying to them about their preferences their best method is to simply use larger sampling asking the same question several different ways will also tend to identify respondents who are not telling the truth in short pollsters are not helpless when trying to determine if someone is telling them the truth or not
704759 while most political pollsters say they dont find large numbers of people lying on polls
704760 and if obama goes down to defeat it will be because of his politics being so out of the mainstream not because he is black
704761 just use your imagination and a hotdog can taste like a filet mignon
704762 my husband keeps mentioning the bradley effect he believes there will be nationwide riots if this obamama loses
704763 my husband keeps mentioning the bradley effect he believes there will be nationwide riots if this obamama loses
704764 but when you have ten polls taken at roughly the same time period and they all basically tell the same story you can discern that the conclusion has a basic validity even if the actual numbers arent exact
704765 why wont you permit a straight up or down vote
704766 there is going to be a vote september 30 will not come and go without a vote on the opening the outer continental shelf the message has been delivered the issue cant be ignored any longer
704767 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives
704768 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
704769 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full fair debate consisting of full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives
704770 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
704771 get this off the table or there will be a big problem for you in november
704772 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
704773 drill on the acreage we have allowed you to dig on
704774 pelosi free our oil mr president were sitting on 700 million barrels of oil that would have an immediate effect in ten days use our strategic supply its for national emergencies and would be a drop in the bucket
704775 you are spinning you are not answering my question it is a simple question will you allow an up or down vote on offshore oil drilling your answer is no lets move on to the next subject
704776 theres a certain amount of inefficiency and risk involved in stopping and having to refuel
704777 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote
704778 i dont look like other people who have been president of the united states
704779 i dont look like other people who have been president of the united states
704780 theyll try to scare you and say im not like all those presidents on dollar bills have a funny name blah
704781 the poster child for obstructing small party and third party candidates from the ballot
704782 some voluntarily saw fit not to return to their jobs the next day and we havent heard from them since
704783 why would they tell the people that they were going to hand over immigration information and then allow them to disappear into the ether
704784 for some reason management felt compelled to warn employees to get out of dodge
704785 simply announcing that you are going to check status is enough to get illegals to leave
704786 unfortunately they probably didnt move back to their country of origin but rather to some other us jurisdiction that isnt enforcing immigration laws
704787 im not doing this for personal gain im here to educate and inform the public
704788 the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
704789 the ninth amendment of the constitution and bill of rights which was forgotten purposely made obscure
704790 everybody has a little better week financially simply because the numbers are so huge
704791 the fact that its in reno and sparks gives opportunities to patronize both cities its good for everyone
704792 it brings in thousands and that in turn benefits retailers restaurants service stations lots of businesses and it generates a lot of taxable sales and that benefits everybody in the state
704793 north american production has been at a plateau in recent years
704794 natural gas production in the lower 48 states has seen a large upward shift after 9 years of no net growth through 2006 an upward trend began that generated 3 growth between first quarter 2006 and first quarter 2007 followed by an exceptionally large 9 increase between first quarter 2007 and first quarter 2008
704795 most likely production will continue to increase for the next few years if demand and prices stay high though possibly not at the same rate as in 2007 there will be some ups and downs in monthly production fluctuations in monthly production are often known to come from hurricanes winter storms or new projects the new independence hub project was offline all of may for some repairs which should cause a noticeable dip in production total u s proved natural gas reserves resources that have been identified and tested and either have been or will be developed have increased for the last eight years and in 10 of the last 11 years recent drilling trends indicate continued growth with a stronger concentration on unconventional resources like shales shale formations in the lower 48 states are widely distributed large and contain huge resources of natural gas they are just starting their full development already the production from just one barnett shale field in texas contributes more than 6 of production from the lower 48 states which is more than from the large producing state of louisiana
704796 when i met him he said wow youre dressed fancier than me babe

704810 theres such a great array of people from whom sen obama can choose
704811 so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards
704812 access to sites in china is continually changing and chinese authorities are not transparent about the censorship process so it is a very difficult thing to keep track of
704813 dit is het probleem verplaatsen er moet wetgeving komen over een openbaar rookverbod zodat iedereen met een gerust hart de straat op kan niet alleen in de winkelstraten maar ook in het bos aan zee in de auto alleen thuis zou dan nog gerookt mogen worden maar ook niet in de tuin daar zouden de buren last van kunnen hebben
704814 rokers mogen alleen in hun eigen huis of tuin roken als ze daarmee niemand tot last zijn
704815 okay from my list of speakers i want a session where the sessions key matches sessionkey now let me grab some fields i need first the key then the title which i need to trim off excess whitespace then lets make a short version of that title since steves title is so long love that title though ill need an link tag for the session set the href and title attributes and then add the speakers name in a div tag so i get a cheap line break im really in xml not html so ill need a root node and a span tag will work without affecting layout and ill add the link and div tags as children
704816 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
704817 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
704818 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it

704823 there is no point going on any further the chairman randy lerner and myself are disappointed but thats the way it is it is up to liverpool and gareth and his agent the ball is firmly in liverpools court
704824 liverpool made their intentions clear to sign gareth almost four months ago and they have known for some time what the price would be
704825 they have been able to find money for another player who wasnt in the equation certainly four months ago and two months ago i have agreed with gareth now thats it no problem liverpool have all the time in the world to do it if they want to raise the money

704920 this is a little like saudi arabia announcing its going to conserve oil
704921 because we are such a water rich part of the globe weve never had to conserve water the fact were doing it now not only shows its important to us but a signal to the rest of the world it has to start doing the right thing

704928 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
704929 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
704930 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
704931 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
704932 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
704933 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
704934 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
704935 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision

704942 this guy can pitch and we know it he showed how good he can be tonight
704943 that was huge because you could tell both starting pitchers were on
704944 thats what you want to do is get a lead there and bengie just got enough of it to get it through hes so clutch
704945 i dont know what to say but its as frustrating as it gets
704946 we just have to play batter everybody has to play better myself included

704951 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
704952 it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
704953 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
704954 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
704955 when it was just wet everybodys deal went fine competitors and our stuff alike
704956 i think it was just making sure that the standing water was gone there were some areas that the drainage didnt keep up with the precipitation
704957 we have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
704958 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain
704959 i couldnt see five feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution
704960 when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
704961 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
704962 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
704963 i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it
704964 it felt really slow and the car was slipping around
704965 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept on the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important
704966 as old as they are theyre a little hard so there was zero grip out there
704967 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
704968 we just did the best we could with what we had to work with
704969 it was a learning experience nascar did what it had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
704970 well take the input from the teams that were there and see if theres something else that we could do that we dont know we needed to do
704971 you did it you changed wild lament into whirling dance you ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers im about to burst with song i cant keep quiet about you god my god i cant thank you enough

704981 why would god create a bunch of people and just because they have different beliefs punish them forever
704982 the last thing i want is to make a bunch of converts to atheism
704983 it doesnt bother me that people are religious or spiritual up until it moves them to do something that harms others
704984 the number just keeps going up or at least the number of people willing to come out of the closet is going up
704985 i had a friend who was very religious and said im going to pray for you
704986 i said its okay you dont need to pray for me
704987 and i am a good person im a very caring person i care for my cats and other people

705019 the israelis are now engaging in a bit of blustering hinting broadly that they are ready to nip irans nuclear program in the bud by conducting a raid similar to that carried out at osirak iraq in 1981 when israeli warplanes bombed saddams nascent nuclear facility that probably isnt going to happen in this case however for two reasons 1 the geographical spread of the various suspected nuclear sites prevents any attempt to knock them out in a single blow or even several blows and 2 instead of fighting their own battles the israelis would much rather use the u s to do their dirty work whenever possible and that seems highly possible given their past success in this area
705020 when it comes to iran though their israelis strategy is just beginning to be put into practice and is running up against a major roadblock in the reluctance of the bushies to climb on board
705021 when a parasite invades it hides as long as it can sucking the vital juices and draining the energy of its host
705022 the world will not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons
705023 israel is a solid ally of the united states we will rise to israels defense if need be
705024 if america does not strike mofaz is saying israel will yet as that could produce the same results as an american attack without the same assurance of success bush may have to restrain israel if he does not want a wider war
705025 there is considerable speculation that israel will attack iran even if the us is hesitant because this is an election year and israel knows and the lobby knows that anything israel does at such times will be applauded by congress and we may end up with the same result in iraq
705026 sucked dry and exhausted to the point of near death
705027 what we are seeing is a game of international poker with the us spreading this disinformation about a pending attack as a high stakes bluff aided ironically by a host of the administrations critics whose shallow analysis seems to be part of our daily email fare the iranians know they have the winning hand for this round at least

705101 have you done this to me havent i been the most perfect of sons to you or have i been a total arse
705102 and my old scout badges not to mention a cozy bed and some supper how can fate be so cruel to a young hamster who possesses not one iota of malice within his slender boyish frame
705103 so he isnt dead after all just stunned and battered
705104 i can see youre feeling better lad best get you on yer feet before you melt all over the floor
705105 you dont have a comb about your person i suppose
705106 this is the most enchanting entity that i have ever laid my eyes upon she is simply divine were i a more heroic type and not a dull brained geek i would sweep her from the ground and carry her away to some tiny edifice built high in the tallest of rhubarb trees
705107 i must apologize most fervently although i meant every word that i inadvertently spoke i feel i must retract them they are unbecoming especially when i speak so freely of someone i do not know
705108 fanangy panakan at your service kind sir cripes listen to me ive come over all posh
705109 youve been nose surfing on a sea of ka ka i had to hose you down
705110 thats right i slipped in some effluent upon the road
705111 its lucky i wasnt driving a go kart i could have had a nasty prang
705112 as it happens i do believe that it might have been the most serendipitous pile of poop that ive ever encountered now may i have my clothes back im feeling a little vulnerable
705113 you nearly took my claw varnish off with your teeth
705114 wait til its gone down in between times i can tell you all about the where house
705115 i dont mean to be impolite but surely after the disastrous johnny grainswallow expedition no one could either gather the funding or possess the temerity to launch another
705116 but north america held more interest for certain individuals than just super hamsters with psychedelic brains and the deadly disease hamsters arse no there was area ninety nine
705117 so there is such a place i mean its not all complete bollocks excuse my hamster french
705118 you mean they just walked in and took the stuff
705119 then the military tried to make weapons of mass destruction from it then they tried to reverse engineer it then they gave up and sold it to me for ten thousand rodentos
705120 you made this into some sort of theme park a fantasy palace you promised to take hamsters to impossible places and see wonderful ah thingys and wotsits
705121 all sorts of rodents rats mice gerbils i even took a cavy once no rabbits though too vicious even the tame ones what you can ride
705122 i got bus loads of em to start with but when i showed em all the wonders to be found in the artifacts of area ninety nine well most of em thought it was clever visual effects others thought theyd gone mad others went 11 completely off their heads and some even lost control of their bowels well of course i had to start administering sedatives didnt i then nobody believed in anything they saw they just thought theyd been on some kinda drug induced trip like you get from them mushrooms up at danglydong dell the business went tits up overnight didnt it
705123 so how do you make repayments on the ten thousand rodento loan
705124 but i get by with selling the odd trinket that i find here and there when i go exploring
705125 ya dont think i got all these area ninety nine artifacts sitting about on shelves gathering dust do ya
705126 theyve got to pay their way you know otherwise its the scrap dealer for em and i know at least one of em who wouldnt want that to happen
705127 you cant have mice fallin down bogs made for folk with rat sized arses can you

705137 lionels going to get his brolly out in the rain
705138 well if thats not a very nice thing to say i dont know what is
705139 but im not particularly au fait with the science fiction genre is colin mocking me
705140 so tell me what does c o l i n stand for i assume its an acronym
705141 cybernetic organism lionel that sounds quite attractive yes well 22 go with that but what about the letter i and n what might they stand for
705142 oh i like it i do like it i like it very much
705143 but it sounds like what it is a load of bollocks that cant be right
705144 oh boney dont fret it doesnt really matter what my creators intended the acronym c o l i n to mean lionel here has given my designation new meaning ill be forever in his debt or at least until next thrudsday
705145 its the best thing thatll ever happen to you its just wowie
705146 we only met a couple of hours ago and even then id been nose surfing upon an ocean of filth before that and boney took it upon himself to hose me down and then you witnessed my sodden nakedness yet still i feel i should know you its like weve been connected for yonks
705147 its hard to explain the where house did it will do it
705148 but if itll help you understand even a little youll be glad to know that the muck spreading hamster is going to spend the night in chunderland general hospital
705149 muck spreading hamster what do you know of the muck spreading hamster i never mentioned him once not even when i was unconscious
705150 but you told me a long time ago in another time and another place
705151 will the muck spreading hamster be spending the night in chunderland general hospital
705152 although richards not really old enough to be up there with david atten borough is he

705154 to have him teaching science at a respectable school is about equivalent to having a flat earther teaching geography
705155 could be discussed in schools in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
705156 what is not fine is to say there are these two theories one is called evolution the other is called genesis if you are going to say that then you should talk about the nigerian tribe who believe the world was created from the excrement of ants
705157 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
705158 i was shocked by how some put up barriers to understanding
705159 i showed them the evidence and they just said this is what it says in my holy book and so i asked if your holy book says one thing but the evidence says something else you then go with your holy book and they said yes and i said why and they said its the way weve been brought up
705160 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with
705161 the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multi culturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing
705162 i would like to see evolution taught a lot earlier there should be no problem teaching it to eight year olds
705163 for parents to deprive their children of an educational opportunity because of a traditional bigotry is unfair on the child
705164 it seems as though teachers are terribly frightened of being thought racist
705165 its almost impossible to say anything against islam in this country because if you do you are accused of being racist or islamophobic
705166 i have a lot of time for the church of england
705167 i feel rather sorry for them in a way compared to the alternatives it is a thoroughly decent organisation and if all christians were like rowan there wouldnt be a problem ive met him socially and he is delightful
705168 when i go to dinner with a bishop i find them very often extremely often very convivial nice people why ever not
705169 often when you talk to bishops it appears they dont believe in very much
705170 it would appear he does believe in it the virgin birth
705171 but he doesnt thrust it down peoples throats his kind of anglicanism is benign and pretty harmless
705172 because we are all brought up to respect faith it leaves open a gap through which fanatics can charge
705173 yes i think we have all been brought up to give too much respect to religion as opposed to any other kind of opinion
705174 well we devote our lives to writing books composing music creating poetry all higher functions of the brain if we were following darwinian dictates we males would be spending all our time fighting other males to get females and screwing them all over the place in order to have lots of children and grandchildren im very glad we have risen above all of that
705175 i certainly have pushed for digital distribution on the title globally im responsible for all dd deals but capcom japan so far has not allowed it
705176 for the record cei developed titles will be distributed extremely widely via digital channels not just steam or direct2drive but more than a dozen partners across more than 100 sites portals for everything we do
705177 the tripwires are more effective than people think part of the problem though is that ea and t2 didnt actually communicate whats supposed to happen
705178 pirates get enough of a taste of the game to see if they like the content but if they want to experience it in non buggy fashion they need to buy it legitimately those issues werent communicated clearly and as such the subset of pirates who use such means to sample content before purchase were clearly turned off
705179 im sort of surprised at how few reviews have come out but then again there are fewer and fewer outlets reviewing pc games these days
705180 even so most reviewers write it off as console dreck because its not an rts an fps or an mmo we think there is an audience for action games on pc that arent fpses even if they are sometimes best played with a gamepad rather than a kb and mouse
705181 we are members of the pcga as a company we strongly believe that the future of the pc is bright

705217 that the global ocean has lost more than 90 of large predatory fishes
705218 the genetic species habitat and ecosystem diversity of the oceans is believed to exceed that of any other earth system
705219 throughout the worlds oceans food fishes once believed to be immeasurable in number are now recognized as greatly depleted and in some cases almost extinct a million vessels now fish the worlds oceans twice as many as there were twenty five years ago are there twice as many fish as before hardly
705220 freezing cod also changed the relationship of seafood companies to fishing ports frozen fish could be bought anywhere wherever the fish was cheapest and most plentiful with expanding markets local fleets could not keep up with the needs of the companies
705221 to three quarters of a ton and having a length of four meters
705222 the magnitude of the fishing harvest and the examples of major alterations to marine food webs by predator removal suggest that effects of fishing are ecologically substantial at large spatial scales
705223 overfishing and ecological extinction predate and precondition modern ecological investigations and the collapse of marine ecosystems in recent times raising the possibility that many more marine ecosystems may be vulnerable to collapse in the near future
705224 the use of antibiotics in salmon farming has been prevalent right from the beginning and their use in aquaculture globally has grown to such an extent that resistance is now threatening human health as well as other marine species

705249 la iglesia catolica sostiene que la contracepcion es contraria a las doctrinas biblicas y por lo tanto alega la absurda tesis de que solo el sexo sin proteccion es permisible las consecuencias de esta posicion pueden ser nefastas para evitar la propagacion del sida y las enfermedades venereas generando asi mas sufrimiento
705250 la escultura no es un comentario al debate sobre el aborto o metodos biotecnologicos sino una expresion artistica en defensa al derecho a la contracepcion y la educacion sexual sin prejuicios

705261 si estaba escrito que jc vendr a con humildad y montado sobre asno entrar a en jerusal n por qu no iba a ser el hijo de una familia humilde y aparentemente tan sufriente como el resto del oprimido puebo jud o de esos momentos

705299 it is most unlikely that we will be able to get lugovoi but we can try to make sure that we dont have another litvinenko
705300 send a strong message that this kind of thing will not be tolerated
705301 litvinenko was a former member of the fsb and he became a very unpopular man i assume as a result of that his death was either officially sanctioned or that some faction or other of the fsb tried to get him
705302 if he litvinenko had drunk the whole cup of tea he would have died instantly it is only because he sipped it that he lingered and polonium was detected
705303 its gonna be a national holiday when she gets boobs
705304 the power ministry has no plans to take any expansion project on its own due to financial constraints
705305 the donor agencies were showing little interest to finance these expansion activities of reb due to massive corruption of the earlier projects financed by them
705306 the reb will not be able to give fresh connections to new consumers from its distribution network before completion of the new expansion programme
705307 the completion of these projects is also vital for the new electricity connection in the rural areas
705308 we will however be able to connect electricity to the consumers on an emergency basis from the existing lines if we keep proper maintenance
705309 the reb has 73 00000 consumers now they have faced serious power cuts during day and night the reb is able to supply only 955 mw of power against the demand of 1851 mw for the rural people in last couple of month
705310 the nation will always remember his contribution in developing bangladesh army and the country through his skill and working experience
705311 the election commission has not yet found any major violations anywhere everything is going well there is no problem
705312 i am more optimistic as time goes on ill wait and see where we are but as things positively progress thats good news
705313 well cross that bridge when we come to it its a team effort there are a lot of people involved in this coaches medics
705314 you sit down and say where are we are you capable of doing yourself justice if yes youve earned the place take it
705315 things are getting better and stronger but then of course they would through the passage of time
705316 the challenge shes taken on is a considerable one and its important for us to make sure that challenge is progressing not at the expense of her long term health and also to see how that challenge is progressing in terms of her getting towards good shape to be able to perform
705317 the transparency international bangladesh tib identified the lged ministry as the most corrupt ministry during the bnp jamaat government tenure bnp secretary general mannan bhuyan who was in charge of this ministry was freed and bnp activists brought out procession in front of the jail violating the emergency rule but the al leaders are not being released due to some lame charges
705318 it truth and accountability commission has been set up with a noble objective its functions began today
705319 its a great opportunity for self realisation i think they corrupts will come to avail of the chance
705320 good jobs done by the caretaker government and the tac is intended to ensure good administrative works welfare of people and human rights
705321 the truth and accountability commission has been created under the right to voluntary disclosure ordinance 2008 has to avert economic disaster
705322 in due course we will consider on case to case basis if we should disclose names if necessary in the national interest we will disclose names

705327 ich lasse mich nicht festlegen wann wie und wo ich zuk nftig meine meinung u ern werde
705328 es geht doch nicht darum dass ich da mal irgendwo einen kommentar geschrieben habe zu dem ich auch jederzeit stehe sondern es geht in wahrheit um den kurs der spd
705329 die reformen die wir gemeinsam mit wolfgang clement durchgesetzt haben haben in der spd viele wunden gerissen die werden aber nicht rascher verheilen wenn clement die spd verlassen muss
705330 dass auf der n chsten ebene eine einvernehmliche l sung erreicht wird
705331 das ist ein reines ablenkungsman ver mit dem ziel sich wichtig zu machen und streit in die spd zu tragen
705332 bsirske agiert nach dem motto links reden rechts leben eigentlich m sste er jetzt zur cktreten
705333 wenn er jetzt nicht zur cktritt sollten ihm die gewerkschafter den stuhl vor die t r setzen
705334 er ist mental nicht hundertprozentig bei der sache das dauert jetzt schon drei wochen da habe ich ihm gesagt ich brauche dich gegen real nicht der rummel um ihn ist nicht gut f r uns und auch nicht f r rafael
705335 das angebot war bei weitem nicht akzeptabel das war nicht so wie wir uns das vorstellen
705336 real hat ein angebot gemacht das der hsv abgelehnt hat das bedeutet dass ich hsv kapit n bleibe
705337 ich w re gl cklich wenn es klappen w rde aber noch bin ich beim hsv
705338 nat rlich m chte er gerne zu real das ist der gr te klub der welt aber bei der l cherlichen summe kann das der verein nicht machen

705342 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
705343 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
705344 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
705345 a large number of spectators had gathered on a hill to see the race when lightning struck down twice among them about 2pm 2200 aest hans eng of the hedemark regional police said

705347 yesterday evening abu mazen mr abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
705348 shortly afterwards israeli defence minister ehud barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
705349 dialogue is important we have called for it egypt has agreed to invite palestinian factions to meet in cairo
705350 we cant lose hope we disagree and fight but we have to work together to bridge the big gap created unfortunately by hamas
705351 those who are accused of breaking the law will be investigated and if they are found to be guilty will be brought to justice those who are proved innocent will be released
705352 confirms these people are breaking the law because they prefer to surrender themselves to the israeli occupation than to stay in their homes
705353 if men can run the world why cant they stop wearing neckties how intelligent is it to start the day by tying a little noose around your neck
705354 for the last four weeks ive been getting death threat comments on this blog

705356 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
705357 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
705358 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
705359 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
705360 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
705361 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
705362 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
705363 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
705364 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
705365 he wants to go to celtic but right now its up to the clubs to come to an agreement we are probably going to know if it will happen this week
705366 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact upon the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
705367 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished the position to specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago
705368 unfortunately for consumers this shift has come at the expense of competition with smaller regional participants building societies credit unions and non bank lenders losing market share or being pushed out entirely
705369 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times

705433 the vision of a global church of interdependent communities is not a vision of an ecclesiastical world empire or even a colonial relic

705470 wahai abu ishaq panggilan ibrahim bin adham sudah sejak lama kami memanjatkan doa kepada allah tetapi mengapa kami tidak dikabulkan padahal dia telah berfirman dalam kitab nya

705478 saya lupa dengan keadaan yang sesungguhnya mayoritas ummat di indonesia yang tingkat pemahamannya amat rendah tentang islam saya saat itu menganggap tingkat pemahaman ummatku sama dengan tingkat pemahaman murid muridku akibatnya ketika saya menyikapi penyelewengan ummat dari as sunnah saya anggap sama dengan penyelewengan orang orang yang ada di sekitarku yang selalu saya ajari ilmu tentu anggapan ini adalah anggapan yang dhalim dengan anggapan inilah akhirnya saya ajarkan sikap keras dan tegas terhadap ummat yang menyimpang dari as sunnah walaupun mereka belum mendapat penyampaian ilmu sunnah sayapun sempat menganggap bahwa mayoritas kaum muslimin adalah ahlul bidah dan harus disikapi sebagai ahlul bidah maka tampaklah dakwah salafiyyah yang saya perjuangkan menjadi terkucil kaku dan keras saya telah salah paham dengan apa yang saya pelajari dari kitab kitab para ulama tersebut di atas tentang sikap ahlul bidah saya sangka ahlul bidah itu ialah semua orang yang menjalankan bidah secara mutlak

705500 he was actually sitting down when i first walked up to him then he stood up im looking at this guy and i said to myself wow that really is killer kowalski you dont expect larger than life people to stick their hand out and say hello to you
705501 but i know one thing i can tell you that walter is a great guy
705502 look i say my name then i say it again
705503 nobody can govern by gun and everybody wants to go to gaza to dialogue with everybody and put an end for this military ugly brutal coup detat
705504 the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased
705505 this believer whom al dajjal kills is al khadir peace upon him
705506 peace be upon you oh people of the household and allahs mercy and blessings every soul shall taste death and you will be given your rewards on the day of rising in allah you will find consolation from every catastrophe and a successor to every one who dies and arrival at everything that was missed so in allah do trust and in him have hope for the only one who is truly afflicted is he who is denied any reward and peace be upon you and allahs mercy and blessings
705507 do you know who that is it is al khidr peace be upon him
705508 al khidr peace be upon him came to me once and introduced himself to me and i acquired from him the knowledge of the souls of the believers are they tortured or in bliss so now even if a thousand scholars argue with me about that and say that he is dead i would not go back to believing what they say
705509 as for al khidr peace be upon him he is alive and i have shaken his hand with this palm and he told me that everyone who says the following every morning will become one of the abdaal
705510 do you know who that man who taught you the dhikr at the lote tree was he is sayyidna al khidr peace be upon him
705511 o khadir teach him that which joins together all the dhikrs invocations and prayers for forgiveness and is superior as to reward larger as to number more exalted in worth and greater in obtaining assistance
705512 and in one year and i think it was my first hajj in 1372 a h i met a kurdish man who was going through a certain spiritual state he came to me and put his hand on my head and started saying blessed blessed so i said to him where is sayyidna al khidr peace be upon him and he said you will meet him at the noble rawda of the prophet so when i arrived to medina i sat on day after the asr prayer in the rawda and a man came to me the like of whom i have never seen before he was wearing a yellow turban and does not have a likeness among the people and he had a great white beard he greeted me and said does this prophet peace be upon him if we greet him does he hear us see us and return the greeting so i said to him yes so he said to me in an eloquent arab tongue you put my heart to rest may allah put your heart to rest then he said to me if we were back in our countries and we send him our greetings does that reach him so i said to him yes so he said to me you put my heart to rest may allah put your heart to rest then he asked me about other things that i cannot remember now then people came to greet me and when they were gone i looked around but could not find him and the words of the kurdish man at mina came to my mind then at night i saw him in a dream vision it was as if i was in the ship that he boarded with sayyidna musa peace be upon him at sea and i saw him standing on land in the same clothes and manner in which i saw him and he was greeting me from far away and pointing to me with his hand meaning i am the one you saw yesterday upon our prophet and upon him be allahs peace and blessings
705513 in one of shaykh salehs lessons a man who is a top level government official and consultant and used to come in his luxurious car to attend the lessons said to the shaykh can sayyidna al khidr appear in the form of a man any man or does he have a particular form in which he appears the shaykh did not reply to him and then another man who had the appearance of poverty and need on him asked the shaykh a question and the shaykh answered him after which that man left then the shaykh turned and said where is the one who asked the first question so the man said me oh shaykh so the shaykh said the man who asked me a question after you was al khadir so the man started looking right and left looking for that other questioner but couldnt find him
705514 why would you read the fatiha to him when he is still alive

705519 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
705520 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
705521 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
705522 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
705523 the vision of a global church of interdependent communities is not a vision of an ecclesiastical world empire or even a colonial relic
705524 the global horizon of the church matters because churches without this are always in danger of slowly surrendering to the culture around them and losing sight of their calling to challenge that culture
705525 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
705526 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
705527 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
705528 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
705529 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
705530 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
705531 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
705532 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
705533 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
705534 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
705535 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
705536 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
705537 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
705538 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
705539 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
705540 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
705541 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
705542 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
705543 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
705544 why in gods name do you shutdown a windows pc by clicking on a button called start
705545 the pitches saturday night didnt have much finish on them
705546 and when you dont have finish its like throwing batting practice
705547 it was feeling better but then when i had to go back out there saturday night it got to the point where i couldnt finish the pitches i couldnt locate the ball inside because i just couldnt get out there its not doing us any good
705548 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
705549 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs

705558 lesi n grave de los ligamentos de la rodilla izquierda
705559 por las l grimas del jugador y el dolor que tiene
705560 sneijder no est bien y estamos todos asustados por la lesi n es un momento muy dif cil tiene mucho dolor hay que hacer la ltima prueba pero no tiene buena pinta
705561 es mejor que lo explique con m s precisi n el doctor pero ya digo que no est bien le vamos a perder alg n tiempo hay posibilidad de que sea el ligamento cruzado es una lesi n dura esperemos que sea menos al final
705562 si vemos que en la falta de la jugada de la lesi n de wesley ni ha pitado falta qu vamos a hacer es lo ltimo que quer amos se puede perder por un penalti pero no con esa dureza
705563 estos partidos siempre son as no tienen car cter amistoso porque hay mucho prestigio cada uno quiere hacer un buen papel ganando a un equipo importante por eso and bamos con mucho cuidado para no correr riesgo con los jugadores de la selecci n porque son partidos serios
705564 primero tenemos que volver a casa y recuperar los nimos luego veremos simplemente es una cosa de f tbol todos los grandes futbolistas han pasado por estas cosas el volver a ser el de siempre pero en este momento hay que mirar con tranquilidad que vamos a hacer
705565 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
705566 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
705567 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
705568 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
705569 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
705570 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
705571 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
705572 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
705573 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
705574 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
705575 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
705576 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
705577 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
705578 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
705579 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
705580 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
705581 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
705582 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
705583 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
705584 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
705585 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
705586 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
705587 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
705588 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
705589 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
705590 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
705591 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
705592 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
705593 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
705594 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
705595 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
705596 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
705597 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
705598 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
705599 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
705600 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
705601 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
705602 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
705603 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
705604 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
705605 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
705606 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
705607 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
705608 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
705609 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
705610 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
705611 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
705612 who are open to doing something on the production side
705613 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
705614 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
705615 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
705616 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
705617 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
705618 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
705619 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
705620 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
705621 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
705622 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
705623 we realize not everyone can be in washington next week but if you can be we ask that you come to the capitol join our colleagues and lend your voice beginning this monday at 10 00 am
705624 if you cant be in washington we ask that you contribute to the cause in other ways such as spreading the word among your constituents writing an op ed for your local newspaper or taking our all of the above energy message to your local airwaves
705625 republicans stand with the american people we share their passion and determination for energy independence and weve pledged to fight boldly until congress heeds their will
705626 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
705627 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
705628 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
705629 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
705630 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
705631 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
705632 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
705633 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
705634 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
705635 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
705636 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

705640 i love my son hes the most precious thing to me in the world if this is what we have to do its going to tear me apart but i know he could potentially kill someone and i cant put him in that situation
705641 what this is going to do to the future of my son is astronomical
705642 his symptoms were communications and they escalated the longer it took for us to understand he was trying to get our attention in any way possible
705643 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
705644 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
705645 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
705646 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
705647 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
705648 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
705649 we are all against another war in the middle east problems cannot be solved through hostility or military attacks we are for a peaceful solution and we see the symptoms of a political solution appearing
705650 i wish to underline what president ahmadinejad said that iran hopes for and works for a political solution and that iran is open to new approaches this is a very promising statement
705651 we are here to work together and as members of the non aligned movement to achieve exactly what the iranian host has put as the symbol of this meeting which is peace and justice
705652 all options that have to be on the table should be political and peaceful
705653 there is no conclusive report or a credible report coming from any un organization especially the iaea that has determined that irans program is military therefore we take it as a peaceful program there are no other indications
705654 there is something new in the air and i hope that things will go in the right direction
705655 unfortunately it doesnt seem that an agreement is around the corner although the main obstacles come from the israeli palestinian occupied territories about building settlements and changing the geographical character of the territories also the vision within the palestinian areas is a very negative element
705656 i do not think the difference between participation and listening is a diplomatic quibble
705657 the bush administration is under severe international and domestic pressure to rein in its radical extremism which has led to catastrophes everywhere and might bring about even worse ones
705658 sending a non participant observer is a way to avoid negotiations and diplomacy while trying to fend off criticism
705659 setting up a diplomatic office is pretty much the same i think the office can also be used for subversion under the pretext of protecting human rights as in cuba
705660 its a sign of pareidolia which is what its called when you see faces in random things clouds the moon mars tortillas truly this is a miraculously improbable confluence of random chance
705661 in reality islam is a revolutionary ideology and programme which seeks to alter the social order of the whole world and rebuild it in conformity with its own tenets and ideals muslim is the title of that international revolutionary party organized by islam to carry into effect its revolutionary programme and jihad refers to that revolutionary struggle and utmost exertion which the islamic party brings into play to achieve this objective
705662 but i know thine abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me
705663 american airlines has extended our special fares and offers for members of the military and their families several times over the past few years and were delighted to do so again
705664 we sincerely appreciate the courage dedication and sacrifice that our troops and their families exhibit on a daily basis and all of us at american look forward to seeing them on one of our flights very soon
705665 i was brought up on the southside of chicago the last of six children there was no shortage of talk of kennedy nixon carter reagan bush and clinton around the ever expanding dinner table
705666 as has been their hallmark this congress bush mccain republicans have once again run away from an important debate failing to back up their words with action
705667 it is this kind of misplaced priorities that is making america less secure
705668 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
705669 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks

705679 as a child i could not comprehend how my country could cold bloodedly target and murder an estimated 110 000 japanese citizens and severely injure another 130 000 innocent civilians in order to save american lives which was the response i always received from every adult i questioned as an adult i am aggrieved that no government official has expressed sorrow for the lives that were vaporized and those that were devastated in 1945 or for the 230 000 innocent japanese who had died from injuries and radiation poisoning by 1950

705684 why did they do it torture political manipulation and the american psychological association by dr bryant welch the regressive effects of current forms of political manipulation that i describe in my new book state of confusion political manipulation and the assault on the american mind thomas dunne books st martin s press june 2008 have not only affected american politics they have also taken their toll on psychologists national organization the american psychological association many apa members were shocked last year when apa twice refused to take an unequivocal stance against psychologists participation in the bush detention centers the fact that other health care organizations typically more conservative than apa on humanitarian issues were very outspoken about the issue made it all the more puzzling

705689 the pentagon defied a congressional subpoena yesterday by refusing to let the head of its sexual assault program testify at an oversight hearing about sexual assault in the military the house panel had issued a subpoena for dr kaye whitley the director of the defense departments sexual assault prevention and response office but pentagon officials ordered her not to testify and instead sent her supervisor michael dominguez a principal deputy undersecretary for defense in her place whitleys absence came on the same day a federal judge rejected the white houses claim to blanket immunity from congressional oversight in an unrelated case

705700 following brain stem testing ben mullany has now passed away the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
705701 i was just messing with my camera from my standpoint it was meant to be harmless these women were just subjects to me
705702 id have been upset to know that those people felt uncomfortable about it but i can hand on heart say i would never do any of this again im a very different man now i am not a danger to women and i never killed jill dando
705703 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases
705704 ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
705705 i headed north like a peasant with a heavy bundle on his back bent over determined to better himself
705706 other people had things so i thought why not me but now i regret it maybe god was punishing me for my illusions
705707 thats the usual story of patients that are released from the national orthopedic hospital
705708 in cases like that if you cut the medical care youre hurting that person
705709 youre doing just the opposite of what the medical system should do that goes against every international convention of human rights and health to send him to guatemala was to send him to very poor living and health conditions and probably he will die because of that and thats not fair
705710 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
705711 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
705712 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
705713 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
705714 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
705715 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
705716 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognizing and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
705717 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
705718 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
705719 i have no interest in being a martyr im just trying to be a good bishop

705725 we had a meeting and they were like three to five minutes late

705732 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
705733 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
705734 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
705735 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
705736 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
705737 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
705738 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box

705757 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times mr rudd told the nine network yesterday
705758 it was a near perfect race one of my best but its one of the most frustrating races in my career
705759 my race was focused on the start because it was the only place we could have passed them mclaren to give us the opportunity to win
705760 thats why i took a lot of risk but it worked and then we showed very good pace afterwards
705761 when lewis had a problem i knew straightaway and reduced the rpm on the engine to save everything i could for the end of the race
705762 i was 23 seconds ahead of heikki i knew what i had to do
705763 i was not in trouble the tyres were not in trouble i was just saving the car for the end of the race but maybe it was not enough
705764 as you saw everything was perfect then you know what happened and it did so without warning without the slightest indication
705765 we gave it our all but these things can happen
705766 now we must not give up but instead we must react quickly
705767 there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground
705768 the sanctions that we and others are proposing are designed to reinforce the drive for the transitional government to reflect the democratic will of the zimbabwean people
705769 being at ub does not mean i stop being a zimbabwean supporting zanu pf has no bearing on my qualifications as a journalist or competence as a media practitioner the maliciousness and childishness of this campaign is testimony to the fickleness of the people behind it who apparently believe universities employ people on political grounds

705775 i hit 18 greens so what can i say its an ironic game
705776 i thought that was very special i waved at the guys and they clapped and i came up 18 and everybody was cheering it just makes you feel good when you get that type of applause
705777 i really didnt care about the rain i just enjoyed the moment walking up 18 it didnt really matter
705778 once im inside the ropes im so focused you push a button and its work focus there were times when there was a little opening and feelings start to play thats what happened here on the last hole and im glad this game has meant so much to me and if i didnt feel anything it would be weird
705779 i love the competition the cheering being under the limelight to hit the perfect 6 iron and make the putt and to win championships thats why i spent all of the time on the putting green and the driving range
705780 i have a lot of opportunities ahead of me if this was the end and i had nothing to do that would be very sad but i have new ones im creating a new chapter in my life

705795 for one reason to get more revenue from the sale of norvir

705797 these unconscionable acts put the researchers their families including their children and their neighbors in grave danger
705798 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live

705807 as they were scourging through the dumping ground they found the bomb and ignorantly tried to break it and that caused the explosion
705808 our local channels jk and take one have been blocked by the administration so that people dont get the information i think its the utter failure of the largest democracy of the world
705809 we have suffered discrimination in delimitation and in jobs and development but we stayed quiet because we though that will alienate kashmir but now we are not to bare this anymore
705810 the ongoing construction boom in the region is excellent news for us and we are putting in place the necessary measures to ensure that we are able to keep up with the demand for quality ready mix concrete the additional plant and vehicles will enable us to meet and surpass current demands which ultimately translates into faster completion of construction projects
705811 we have at our disposal the finest equipment available including state of the art plants a large fleet of truck mixers mobile and stationery pumps placing booms and other equipment all of which allows us to guarantee customer satisfaction and to produce the best quality ready mix concrete

705817 we believe that we have a strong economic course of action to take australia through these difficult global economic times mr rudd told the nine network yesterday
705818 the fact that people came back to visit our booth and look at the materials two or three times was outstanding
705819 i cant tell you the number of people who told us that we were the only company to offer anything new and interesting at the show this year
705820 we are very excited about our relationship with surecrete the company has an outstanding reputation for providing superior customer service
705821 and while we have been working with manufacturers for several years this partnership has opened up an entirely new market for our technology we are especially excited with how enthusiastically the market has embraced the product line
705822 the materials introduced at the world of concrete were only the beginning
705823 we look forward to a long successful relationship with carpenterstone
705824 at the end of the season well find out if the dodgers want me to finish my career here were going to sit down and talk about the situation

705828 throughout her seven year tenure as labor secretary elaine chao has been missing in action when it comes to keeping workers including miners safe on the job
705829 sadly the secretarys lack of leadership in addressing the crandall canyon disaster is consistent with the overall lack of leadership she has shown on mine safety issues
705830 while msha is implementing the recommendations of the inspector generals report reviews by the outside independent panel and the official accident investigation team are ongoing and any comment at this time would be speculative and headline grabbing
705831 election year partisan attacks go with the territory but this zeal for exploiting tragedy politically interfering with enforcement investigations and making baseless smears ignores the truth
705832 worker fatality injury and illness rates are at record lows under this administrations leadership
705833 given the gravity of this situation i can understand why secretary chao believes it is premature to make a final determination prior to the completion of the report from msha
705834 the lives of the nations miners depend on prompt reform at msha
705835 making our mines safer is the best way to honor those who died at crandall canyon
705836 the least the labor secretary can say is there appears to be troublesome issues that we need to look at
705837 having the first combined asphalt and aggregates facility in california to be certified as iso 14001 compliant provides independent confirmation of vulcan

705845 he was screaming that he was on fire that he was burning and he was standing in sprinklers on the roadside then he was trying to run into traffic
705846 he is an older white male but we cant release his identity at this point
705847 due to his condition and our interaction with him the homicide unit has been assigned to protect the individual the department and the public
705848 we intend to conduct a thorough investigation of what occurred

705872 the race started quite well as i had a good pace
705873 then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor
705874 it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned
705875 by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
705876 bourdais made a good start moving up from 19th on the grid to 16th

705878 fortunately it was extinguished in time but the problem reoccurred at his second stop
705879 we must now carry out a full investigation of all the problems after what was a very disappointing weekend for the whole team

705924 what do they call it multi culti its all absurd you know

705953 you can definitely do it part time and in fact i think thats the best way to start
705954 this business is open to people from all financial backgrounds a domain costs less than 10 most places so you can start with very little those who already have a lot of money can afford to buy more attractive assets right away but others can certainly build up to the major player level over the years ive seen many people become millionaires
705955 why would any domainer sell his valuable name at a large auction

705957 we are not going to speculate or jump to conclusions until we have gathered all the evidence
705958 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
705959 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
705960 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
705961 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
705962 our communion longs to stay together but not only as an association of polite friends
705963 it is seeking a deeper entry into the place where christ stands to find its unity there
705964 promise to our fellow human beings the generosity god has shown us
705965 i hope that if part of the message of lambeth 08 is that we need to develop covenantal commitments and that one aspect of this might be what you call covenanted restraint this will be seen in the context of a unity not enforced but given in christ
705966 to embrace deeper and more solid ways of recognising and trusting each other can be a grace not a burden and when trust is deepened more responsible and prayerful discussions can follow
705967 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
705968 we have quite a strong degree of support for a pastoral forum to support minorities a strong consensus on the need to examine how the instruments of communion will best work and a recognition though still with many questions that a covenant is needed
705969 at a time when many companies including our competitors are constantly cutting costs to the detriment of their product we are constantly looking to improve our product

705972 the seminary is the heart of every community fertile ground for vocations it is the seminary which forms future priests according to st charles the holy archbishop of milan and patron of seminaries the superior should guard the seminary with his life those in charge of the education of the young men called to the holy priesthood have a very special responsibility for this reason the founder and prior general of the institute of christ the king sovereign priest msgr gilles wach has always taken great care to staff the seminary with very experienced members of our institute given the ever increasing number of american vocations among our seminarians and sisters there has for a long time been an urgent need for a spiritual director well versed in several languages and familiar with american culture hence during his visit to the united states during the month of may msgr wach decided to select for this important task a priest well seasoned by his many years of service a priest in whom he has the greatest confidence for his fatherly wisdom and his well rounded personality at the same time the exceptional growth of the institute worldwide and as well as in the united states calls for additional priestly appointments msgr wach will send more priests to the united states father laurent jantaud former guest master of the seminary and father henry fragelli our newly ordained priest from the united states thus it is my task to announce the following changes all of which are related to a change which is both important and essential and which will greatly benefit not only our seminary but also all of you dear faithful who desire to have well trained priests as your shepherds
705973 he felt ok looked a little rusty thats to be expected
705974 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
705975 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
705976 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
705977 when you lose billy wagner thats very critical for us

705984 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans
705985 almost everybody at riid believes that he has absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
705986 im not sure if panic is quite the right word but it is close enough anthrax played a role in my decision to support the bush administrations desire to take out saddam hussein i linked him to anthrax which i linked to sept 11 i was not going to stand by and simply wait for another attack more attacks i was going to go to the source hussein and get him before he could get us as time went on i became more and more questioning but i had a hard time backing down from my initial whoop and holler for war
705987 anthrax remember anthrax it seems no one does anymore at least its never mentioned but right after the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 letters laced with anthrax were received at the new york post and tom brokaws office at nbc there was ample reason to be afraid
705988 the attacks were not entirely unexpected i had been told soon after sept 11 to secure cipro the antidote to anthrax the tip had come in a roundabout way from a high government official and i immediately acted on it i was carrying cipro way before most people had ever heard of it
705989 for this and other reasons the anthrax letters appeared linked to the awful events of sept
705990 in the following days as the horror started to be airbrushed no more bodies plummeting to the sidewalk the anthrax letters started to come some to people i knew
705991 that more or less is how i made my decision to support the war in iraq
705992 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
705993 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
705994 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
705995 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
705996 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning

706007 they say they expect to have more information on this very soon i have to trust what theyre telling me
706008 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
706009 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today

706104 there is currently no evidence of transmission of the salmonella through consumption of processed foods containing tomatoes jalapenos or any other vegetables because normal cooking temperatures such as those used in preparing campbell products will inactivate the bacteria
706105 this is why the food and drug administration considers fully cooked products like soups pasta sauces vegetable based beverages and salsa to be safe
706106 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
706107 current u s strategy against the terrorist group al qaida has not been successful in significantly undermining the groups capabilities
706108 the united states cannot conduct an effective long term counterterrorism campaign against al qaida or other terrorist groups without understanding how terrorist groups end
706109 the term we use to describe our strategy toward terrorists is important because it affects what kinds of forces you use
706110 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
706111 the united states has the necessary instruments to defeat al qaida it just needs to shift its strategy and keep in mind that
706112 never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option
706113 thats where obama is headed right now and for the record that does not mean there is no difference between him and mccain or that i am encouraging electoral abstinence those are red herrings it means the war has in many respects escaped the calculable control of the american state no matter who the president is
706114 i realize that in an electoral campaign you dont want to antagonize large groups which are highly motivated this is a very dangerous period of time with very unpredictable consequences you have three countries
706115 if we end up with war in iraq afghanistan pakistan and iran at the same time can anyone see a more damaging prospect for americas world role than that thats the fundamental foreign policy dilemma at the back of this election a four front war would get us involved for years it would be the end of american predominance
706116 for those who believe the illegal invasion of afghanistan was a justified military action to capture and bring to justice 9 11 01 perhaps i would offer this reminder
706117 john pilger describes the denigration of the of civilian casualties in colonial wars and the anointing of barack obama as he tours the battlefields sounding more and more like george w

706123 i think i know american racism belligerence global provincialism greed and desire and ability to dominate the world fairly well
706124 difficulties in comparing prices from one vastly different era to another
706125 almost as soon as the next administration takes office the military services are expected to submit requests for additional funds quite possibly 100 billion or more to cover costs of overseas operations and of repairing and replacing worn equipment through the remainder of the fiscal year
706126 we need more officers and we are pulling every lever we can
706127 we do not anticipate having grown all the majors until about 2013
706128 an incentive for our highest performing officers to stay on active duty
706129 there is a tipping point that we have started to reach
706130 there is a much larger percentage of officers who is planning to get out right at 20 years and once they are gone they are gone
706131 a lot of my retirement plans hinges on the deployment cycle and the war on terror as it exists today
706132 now i am doing about one year over there and 18 months out
706133 if that continues on to 2012 we would be leaning to getting out
706134 as i look to the future i see the choices i am offered narrowing and the freedom of decision i had start to go away because of the shortages
706135 i was originally scheduled to get my masters and go teach and that was derailed by deployments that window is gone for me now
706136 attended a local obama campaign democratic platform conference but my wife psychologist and i retired md were on the health care panel not foreign policy
706137 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
706138 john kerry rebukes wesley clark on meet the press brokaw loses his memory too
706139 do you really think being a pow entitles someone to be president that talking point works on you
706140 yes i would have voted for the authority i believe it was the right authority for a president to have
706141 although i would have done this very differently from the way president bush has
706142 john mccain not serious silly ads silly attacks trivial like his choice of two female celebrities hes not to be taken seriously sings silly songs about bombing whines when criticized denies his lies john mccain unserious in serious times
706143 where is kerry clinton and some others why arent they coming out and defending obama
706144 obamas camp has to do a better job at surrogate selection
706145 obamas camp has to do a better job at surrogate selection not all of them but most have been just awful either going on the offensive or deflecting a false charge

706150 the office of the prime minister received six out of 10 official resignations from the cabinet members that announced they were leaving their jobs and we sent messages urging the others to make their intentions clear and bring their letters
706151 the ministers we named include three positions that had remained vacant and the other two are replacing freshly resigned ministers we are planning to fill the other positions following consultations

706173 saya mengajak untuk memperbaiki pribadi islam kita hanya allah yang mahatahu apa yang ada dalam lipatan hati kita untuk siapa setiap langkah yang kita buat ini
706174 umat islam dunia dan indonesia jangan terjebak pada permusuhan hanya karena perbedaan pendapat tentang hal tertentu atau hanya karena perbedaan kelompok atau partai politik

706180 when pilgrims started pushing down and the way was very crowded the stampede took place
706181 security in afghanistan has deteriorated and our enemies are on the offensive
706182 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection
706183 its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
706184 until now there hasnt been a reliable way to tell if somebody a hacker an isp corporate firewall or the great firewall of china is modifying your internet traffic en route
706185 the few tests available have been for narrow and specific kinds of interference or have required tremendous amounts of advanced forensic labor switzerland is designed to make general purpose isp testing faster and easier
706186 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
706187 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
706188 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
706189 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
706190 but it comes in a lull in the campaign june and july you know the primary is over it tends to get a little dull usually the negative ads havent appeared yet and so its sort of a perfect time to begin the guessing game
706191 if theres anything is some guys closet some local reporter who has covered this person for eight or 12 or 16 years might know about and might it get out before the candidate has committed to an embarrassing choice

706204 many people buy these packages to k 2 and especially to everest
706205 they are certainly strong people but they do not have enough experience to react they dont know how to behave in the case of emergencies in the case of missing ropes in the case of bad weather
706206 there are so many people all together that they have a feeling of safety but at the first problem the whole thing goes wrong and thats whats happening now on k 2
706207 a mountain is a mountain not a coast on a sea or a hotel room and if a mountain is putting down ice or the weather is changing these people are totally unprepared

706210 we plan on enhancing the inspection program over the next year and a half on this road to eliminate the probability of this slide happening again
706211 its actually a world class program theres a risk of driving in british columbia and the risk of rock fall is much less than the risk of injury in a car accident
706212 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on
706213 it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe
706214 we felt the race probably came off as good as it could have
706215 in hindsight there might have been one or two little things we could have done different but we have no experience at running races like that
706216 when it was just wet everybodys deal went fine competitors and our stuff alike
706217 i think it was just making sure that the standing water was gone there were some areas that the drainage didnt keep up with the precipitation
706218 we have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
706219 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain
706220 i couldnt see five feet in front of me down the straightaway under caution
706221 when everybody stopped i just ran into the back of them
706222 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
706223 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
706224 i couldnt see the end of pit lane i just couldnt see it
706225 it felt really slow and the car was slipping around
706226 it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept on the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important
706227 as old as they are theyre a little hard so there was zero grip out there
706228 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning
706229 we just did the best we could with what we had to work with
706230 it was a learning experience nascar did what it had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
706231 well take the input from the teams that were there and see if theres something else that we could do that we dont know we needed to do
706232 the current transit network has been designed to get people to and from vancouver it was based on the old model that thats where people went for work but we know now that a lot of the travel in the south of fraser is between point in the south fraser region
706233 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
706234 when a certain nationality surpasses others there must be a fair distribution among working nationalities in the country
706235 we have now collected the pieces of nine dead women and still there are other parts scattered
706236 a minibus full of seriously injured women was rushed to hospital and i think the death toll will be more than this only two women who sell tea along the road survived
706237 the government will be working as normal and we have no worries about those who resigned
706238 this is a significant message from the chinese to say that china is now open to the world

706243 this is a provision with astonishing reach and it was slipped into the bill just this week not only does it affect nearly every credit card transaction in america such as visa mastercard discover and american express but the bill specifically targets payment systems like ebays paypal amazon and google checkout that are used by many small online businesses the privacy implications for americas small businesses are breathtaking
706244 privacy groups like the center for democracy and technology and small business organizations like the nfib sharply criticized this idea when it first appeared earlier this year
706245 finally new yorkers can say stop the junk and have the force of the law behind them with the ability to file complaints directly against distributors

706247 sustainable flatbush strongly supports the unsolicited materials law as part of our mission to promote sustainable living in flatbush brooklyn it is a prime example of thinking globally while acting locally we vocally oppose the waste of thousands of pounds of paper that unsolicited materials represent we call these materials junk litter and have to remove piles of flyers menus and advertising papers from our porches lobbies and front lawns no one should have the right to dump litter this way we hope that the businesses that promote this practice understand that they are not only wasting paper but are wasting money too
706248 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

706266 the decrease in crime will continue as long as access to abortion remains good
706267 the fact that fewer unwanted children were born who may have been abused or brutalized has resulted in a drop in the number of young men with a rage in their hearts the decline in crime has continued unabated over the last eight years and i predict it will continue this has resulted in fewer unwanted and abused children a decrease in crime and most probably a decrease in emotional and mental illness as well
706268 unfortunately the press gallery has taken the view they are going to be the opposition to the government
706269 they dont ask questions at my press conferences now well just take the message out on the road theres lots of media who do want to ask questions and hear what the government is doing
706270 i think that its good news that the one who may be the next prime minister wont hold a list

706278 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
706279 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
706280 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

706283 b c is trying to position itself in both camps its an inconsistency
706284 i think they the government hope that the people understand that politics is about making hard choices and sometimes one is forced to make choices that arent necessarily consistent with each other
706285 if we do get details of the cap and trade component alongside the carbon tax i think people will be prepared to live with the seeming contradictions
706286 we need to be talking to those industries we need to be talking about what they can do to deal with emissions issues and begin to address that while of course still trying to keep the economy buoyant
706287 theres got to be a discussion and it should be a public discussion where british columbians understand what the implications of this are
706288 its about finding the most cost effective and economically viable ways of reducing the carbon imprint that we all have across the system
706289 we have to move into the new century and into the new framework that asks us to think about our resources not waste them be thrifty with them use them to the maximum ability that we can

706291 what if a small group of these world leaders were to conclude the principal risk to the earth comes from the actions of the rich countries

706330 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
706331 not many presidents could say in the history of u s diplomacy that relations with south korea japan china and thailand are strong and robust a lot of times if youre friends with one you made it hard to be friends with another
706332 there is some worry especially among the japanese that the u s is going to be too focused on china
706333 there is still something to the critique that they were overly focused on the middle east

706343 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proven that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
706344 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proven that they can deliver if you give them enough time
706345 proven that they can dig out of a hole because you have to believe they can create return fast enough to help you catch up from any down period you want them to be able to live up to the expectation you had for the fund when you first bought it which means you have to believe they can get performance back to what you expected over time
706346 when a manager loses conviction in what they are doing thats a problem
706347 go back to why you bought the fund in the first place
706348 and look to see what has changed most managers made their reputation with some periods where they had some trouble unless you are trying to time the market or you see some change in the fund or the hole they have dug for the fund is just too deep you have to give them a chance to rebound or you will never achieve the kind of results that attracted you to the fund in the first place

706352 it is one of the most significant and interesting sites discovered in cirencester we knew that there was important archaeology there as it is very close to the major road system of the roman town of cirencester
706353 there are known to be a scatter of such farmsteads across the cotswold landscape but what is remarkable is the size of the settlement as it is quite large and the activity on it was unusual
706354 this is one of the largest excavations in cirencester as it covers several hectares it seems to have been a settlement which went through various changes over time which is unusual
706355 it may have been an area people came back to again and again and perhaps these materials were placed as some type of thanksgiving
706356 het is een fantastisch moment hier heb ik jarenlang naartoe gewerkt hopelijk is de ban nu gebroken en volgen er snel meer overwinningen massa en lewis waren vandaag sneller dan ik maar ik ben zuinig geweest op mijn banden en heb in de slotfase massa onder druk gezet ik hoopte op problemen bij hem en dat gebeurde ook het ging niet makkelijk maar ik ben ontzettend blij met mijn eerste overwinning

706373 civil rights groups have begun a welcome attack on a house bill that would temporarily exempt the states from the all important accountability requirements in the no child left behind act which was signed into law in 2002 the attack led by powerful groups like the leadership conference on civil rights was unexpected given that the nations two big teachers unions actually hold seats on the conferences executive committee recent events suggest that the civil rights establishment generally is ready to break with the teachers unions and take an independent stand on education reform
706374 right of lebanon its people army and resistance to liberate or reclaim its land

706381 we hope the advocacy groups back up what they told us
706382 the idea that millions of people are going to knock on the governments door and ask to be deported is pure fantasy this is not a solution this is mass deportation on the cheap and it just wont work
706383 we need to end these raids these raids do absolutely no good
706384 for all the fine print we dont disclose very much
706385 i saw a little girl in tears she was looking for her parents

706389 i am not a mediator nor an emissary and was not asked to deliver any message by any western official
706390 the department has received the complaint and intends to review it carefully
706391 we hadnt even announced the pi on ridge mill at the time the doe closed the process
706392 thats an interesting question but how could the doe do it when they didnt even know about it
706393 our mill is being built whether weve got those leases or not the impact wont be any different theres a limited capacity at the mill it doesnt increase the impact by having doe leases
706394 we think the doe did the proper review i think the doe will definitely prevail in the lawsuit
706395 the does actions defy logic for a program established to encourage the expansion of uranium mining when we all know the history of contamination and disease that existed in the past in the uravan mining district
706396 the legacy of uranium mining in colorado has been devastating
706397 you cannot do a good job at that until you look at a mines plan of operation which they have not done thirty eight mines on 27 000 acres are obviously going to have impacts the pi on ridge mill will be dependent on these mines operating and the mill will have impacts existing mills already have environmental impacts
706398 we also want them to work with blm and epa along with other federal agencies to develop a long term leasing program based on assessing the cumulative impacts of uranium mining and milling in this region and each agency passes the buck and refuses to take responsibility for it
706399 so we are asking the court to intervene and to order the doe office of legacy management to do their job properly
706400 the first objective is in the context of the framework convention on climate change to determine the factors of emissions in order to carry out an inventory of greenhouse gases released by the sector
706401 the countries of the developing south according to the convention must adopt measures but are not obligated like the industrialised countries to reduce their emissions that is why we want to know for the countries like new zealand that do have an obligation how much they emit and how they are going to cut emissions
706402 no power plant numerous congressional delegates and representatives have publicly voiced their opposition against desert rock and the need for public citizens to do the same is critical at this stage of desert rock people need to write letters to the editor of their local newspapers congressional representatives and engage in public forums about the cumulative costs of coal and the need for renewables

706411 the fact is the world in the 1940s was in a race and someone was going to use it first its a sad fact in history that we had to drop the bomb twice
706412 i tried to take my life that too failed i couldnt even die
706413 my decision then was that america dropped the bomb confiscated my youth and destroyed my family im going to get even with america i want to see all the parents die like my parents died all the children to suffer i spent the next two years trying to figure out how to get to america
706414 daddy was the sun i was the earth i circled him the world took the greatest gift from me
706415 daddy i know what youre trying to do but you cant kill all the american grown ups your children are going to suffer their children are going to suffer daddy is that what you want
706416 it was the darkness in my own heart of getting my own revenge
706417 he said takashi my son you have found the greatest way to avenge your enemy by forgiveness
706418 in many ways i am not a model father but one thing i have learned over these decades is that the greatest way to show love is setting yourself free by forgiving
706419 he felt ok looked a little rusty thats to be expected
706420 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
706421 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
706422 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch

706426 rehab was added to the album at the last minute i was just messing around at the piano and realized it would be a good instrumental song very bluesy based on a wurlitzer piano figure which i included in my version of course the whole thing came down very quickly and spontaneously tony moore a good friend had just happened to be coming over played the drum part on bobby colombys 30 year old slingerland drum set that was over here that he used to play with blood sweat and tears we got into a groove reminiscent of ramsey lewis in crowd i called up bud harner musician and now artist manager and he came down to hang with us while we put the track together so it was like a little party in the studio rex co producer suggested i do a motown style back beat guitar part which i recorded with plenty of spring reverb like a record from the 60s which is one of my favorite things about the track gary meek and rick braun came over to play the horn parts down a few days later and that was pretty much it at first i didnt know if it was going to make the record but pretty much everyone we played it for gave us very positive feedback
706427 i have what the doctors call a bit of a weight problem
706428 theres something intangible missing from this dark knight for all its thrum and thunder nolans film feels chilly and ill at ease
706429 anyway he goes on and it turns into one of those things where we pit some quote unquote postmodern hero against the quote unquote true hero and we all end up cheering for jesus and feeling sorry for the other guy who could only be all he could be this is that christian ghetto we whine about
706430 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

706484 we are saddened that one who is to protect the faith should so confuse hurt and divide the people of god
706485 we are dismayed at the lack of clarity and the resulting confusion of the archbishops approach to human sexuality especially homosexuality
706486 we are painfully aware that this issue has the potential to rip the fabric of the anglican communion apart and we are distressed that the archbishop should inflame divisions even further
706487 their conference statement fills us with greater confidence and engenders a greater unity than our own primates speech
706488 we call upon the archbishop to reconsider his position on this issue
706489 there is a sense in which the church is already split with a largely liberal southern church but a somewhat different church in the north where three quarters of our members live

706602 huh yeah i guess so what is it anyway cramming for a test
706603 well we found this stone while adventuring around had a sun pattern on it anyway a wizard named marlak took it to study we havent heard from him in a while we traveled here to see what there was to find out the chancellor had us in to see him right away drilled us for information and told us to forget about it im hoping this book might have some information
706604 yeah but keep this quiet i know youre reliable on that at least being a librarian
706605 oh come on sera youve got time for this whats all this about huh
706606 glod as soon as you started reading the book you put it down and suddenly wanted to get to your test and now she suddenly has more important things to do i dont need a spell to tell me theres something up here
706607 well its an enchantment spell if that wasnt already obvious but i cant tell much else
706608 i never really studied enchantments much if its just some kind of suggestion spell she should snap out of it soon enough we should probably wait around here for a few minutes to see what happens
706609 well i mean ive got plenty of time to finish this i guess
706610 sera theres some kind of enchantment on this book it distracts you or something it doesnt seem all too powerful but do you know of any way to break it

706621 i think that the current difficulties the current duress i think the most likely scenario with respect to all of that is that it will likely continue for quite some period of time could get a little bit worse
706622 theres always some chance that matters could get better more rapidly but i think thats very low probability
706623 and theres some chance and hopefully its a low probability that things could get considerably worse

706642 i really thought i could deal with my problems on my own
706643 they offered counseling and even when cps child protective services got involved i never accepted it because i was afraid they would take my baby away
706644 the goals of that family court conflicted with the goals of the immigration court which were to determine whether or not someone in tatyanas position deserved a second chance in the united states
706645 one way to preserve more families is to prevent child maltreatment an overwhelming body of research on the negative effect of poverty on children tells us that generous public support of child welfare would dramatically reduce cases of child abuse and neglect
706646 for hundreds of years we have addressed problems largely related to poverty by way of mass incarceration of people of color and expansion of a prison industrial complex similarly rather than engage in meaningful immigration reform we destroy families create fatherless and motherless children by detaining immigrants then forcibly ship them to countries many of them have not seen since they were a few years old
706647 welfare reform impacted primarily black and latina women once it became clear to korean business owners that this is going to affect their mothers and elderly too it did provide the space for people to work across race and across issue there has to be an increased level of solidarity work and the people involved in child welfare would have to have been involved

706681 i talked to guys who came to our team from other teams and other guys around the league and they told me their defensive coordinator would say all week leading up to a game with the browns last year make sure you stop wimbley
706682 i cant be specific i dont want to tip off our opponents but ive got some stuff planned
706683 without a doubt the depth on our line is improved this year
706684 ive got more people with me this year those are two great additions their presence will take some of the pressure off me ill have more opportunities to go one on one and hopefully i can take advantage of that
706685 our whole defense needs to be better than it was last year
706686 my numbers fell off as the defenses numbers fells off you can say this happened or that happened but i dont like to point fingers the bottom line is that im responsible for myself if i want more sacks i have to play better
706687 im a competitor so sure i want more sacks this year

706727 i had written two novels before i had the idea for harry though id never tried to get them published and a good job too i dont think they were very good
706728 you sort of start thinking anythings possible if youve got enough nerve
706729 where the idea for harry potter actually came from i really couldnt tell you i was traveling on a train between manchester and london and it just popped into my head i spent four hours thinking about what hogwarts would be like by the time i got off at kings cross many of the characters in the books had already been invented

706735 i dont disparage the shallow concerns of the ordinarily vain which after all i share what i hate is all this new age voodoo about eating the notion that foods are either harmful or healing that a good diet makes a good person and that that person is necessarily lean limber toned and fit quite apart from anything else i dont see the muscular morality argument why should a concern for your physical health be seen as a sign of virtue such a view seems to me in danger of fusing nazism with its ideological cult of physical perfection and puritanism with its horror of the flesh and belief in salvation through denial

706745 the racial angle is the first thing i thought of when i saw that ad it fits into the celebrity stuff too
706746 where it goes from here well have to wait and see
706747 its possible the situation will get quite a bit worse
706748 things are going extremely well but thats a matter for us to sit down and talk to the ratings agencies and to assure them thats the case
706749 they put the fanaticism right back into the word fan
706750 theyre so dedicated i mean theyre loyal and they get so excited you wouldnt think its about books that always surprises me you know thats how i felt about books as a kid
706751 but it was a really nice childhood my parents were good parents
706752 so did you ever think during that time that there was a writer buried in there somewhere
706753 no i never dreamed of being a writer and i know that just sounds horrible because so many people do and they dont get this opportunity but that to me was such a i mean how vulnerable is that to do that and try for that because you know youre gonna fail you know everybody tries for that
706754 i had this completely amazing dream that was just you know about first love
706755 when i woke up i was so mad you know because it was right in the middle i wanted it to continue and i didnt wanna call up somebody and be like oh let me tell you about this dream everybody
706756 so i wrote it down i had made my dream into a real existence and i was hooked on writing from that day
706757 i was writing this story i dont really know how i thought of it myself it was just this thing i was doing
706758 so while im making breakfast for the kids and my husband was getting them off i was thinking about you know whats going to happen and what are they going to say now it was coming so fast the problem was not being able to type fast enough
706759 and when every time the kids needed something i was pretty bad
706760 i sent out i think 15 queries total i got nine rejections five no responses and one assistant who pretended to be acting on behalf of an agent who asked to see it october i got my agent and november i had a deal with little brown my publisher that was not quite six months
706761 one day im just staying up writing a story for fun and the next day i have a career
706762 in my head you know j k rowling and some of the other authors that ive always loved are in this other place you know so this put me up there with the real authors and that was you know a lot
706763 i like to sort of see what people are saying and how theyre saying it i wanna know peoples reactions sometimes thats not always a good thing you know there are reactions im not expecting but i just like to know what people are thinking
706764 before i ever thought of twilight as a book or something i would publish i was casting it in my head
706765 does it ever make you anxious at all thinking oh my gosh im all the way up here
706766 and you know when youre on top its always a long way down
706767 i think you have to be afraid of the fall
706768 so if everything goes away tomorrow and no one ever picks up another one of my books and no other movies are made and i just stay in my house im gonna be ok with that so im not afraid of anything
706769 this morning i was very nervous but i focused on my game and now i won so i am happy

706777 its disappointing that sen obama has refused our offer to do joint town hall meetings
706778 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of s magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people
706779 i hear you we are both friends and whatever assurances you need to keep you happy we will gladly give
706780 im beginning to learn that there is no such thing as the perfect preparation but i think with everything that has come up thus far in my preparation i have made the right decision
706781 so in that sense yes ive done everything in my power to get to beijing in the best shape possible
706782 im not a superstitious person no photos no mementos no rituals no lucky underpants
706783 i just train hard then go out on the track and have fun on competition day
706784 i am actually very relaxed and chilled out which is a very good thing and the extreme opposite to how i was feeling this time last year leading into the world championships
706785 the main thing is i am healthy and my final two races have really brought me forward
706786 the victory in stockholm was good and even though i finished fourth in london over the mile i was happy because it is not my preferred event and i was only a stride behind world champion and olympic favourite bernard lagat
706787 we have been able to work on a few things in training and the key now is not to go over the top before beijing
706788 while i may be starting to feel great on the track i have to remember that i have to hold that form until august 23 and the 5000m final
706789 i cant believe its this time now already it feels like a second ago that the trials were on
706790 its really exciting to me that its coming up to racing time im definitely ready to go and im looking forward to having it all come together
706791 with the opening ceremony only five days away it would be fair to say that nerves and excitement have reached a new high in our camp
706792 i feel that i have done everything within my control to make sure i am in the form of my life
706793 luckily mum and dad ring me every other day and bring me up to speed with the latest developments
706794 i generally get off the phone feeling very pumped and motivated
706795 we depart for china on the night of the opening ceremony august 8
706796 there is still a lot of hard work to get through but motivating myself for a training session where i am going to push myself so hard i feel like i am going to explode is not difficult because its the olympic games
706797 so thank you for following my training in the lead up to the olympics i will do my very best to make you guys proud
706798 im as fit as ive ever been and so are the boys were ready to roll
706799 i cant wait to get out on the water and see what we can do
706800 we wont make that same mistake again we will only focus on what we can do in our boat not worry about anyone else and what theyre doing
706801 everyone can bank on a bloody honest performance and nothing less
706802 i must say im nervous it being my first games but i would be worried if i wasnt feeling a bit nervy so close to the main event
706803 the build up has been positive and we have come to beijing not just for the olympic experience but to win gold
706804 im thrilled we arrived at the athletes village early on july 28 and that will be invaluable come the business end of the games when medals will be up for grabs
706805 my family are here mum dad and my brother and his girlfriend and to have them here for my first games is a huge lift for me
706806 mum and dad presented me with a beautiful necklace and it had seven rings
706807 but being in china and the number eight having so much significance to the people here and the fact the games begin on 8 8 2008 made me put an extra ring on the jewellery
706808 the moment is almost here and im ready to go all i can say now is bring on the games i urge everyone back home to get behind us in our quest for olympic glory
706809 this will be the last time you hear from me before heading to beijing from hong kong
706810 i cant believe that the olympics are almost here this is what sport is all about
706811 this is what you have been training for and it is right here in front of you all about to start
706812 you start thinking have i done enough and are my body and mind ready
706813 well they are and there is no turning back now
706814 i just have to get in there and run the bloody race of my life and whatever result comes out of it it will be the best i can do
706815 we did some fantastic team building stuff with the defence force and weve brought that to the court against brazil winning both games easily last week
706816 finally getting all the girls together has been great and we have done some specific training for our opening game which is at 9am on the day after the opening ceremony
706817 while we were at camp at the gold coast we did the game specific stuff where we got up at 6am had breakfast and got ready for a game at 9am
706818 apparently our opponent belarus have been doing the same thing and they are one of those tricky unpredictable teams so we are leaving nothing to chance
706819 we are not long home from europe and i am touched by the amount of support i have received from tasmanian people
706820 i was in paying off my credit card yesterday and the lady says oh are you still here
706821 i feel i am just getting settled back and soon it will be time to go
706822 right now i am doing all the little things to get ready such as washing
706823 getting it dry in a tasmanian winter is a tough ask
706824 though the olympics are on my mind sometimes they are not in the forefront of my thoughts
706825 when someone i dont even know says good luck in the street it hits you that you are going i feel good
706826 the european campaign on the whole was a success because i broke the australian record i feel im ready
706827 i am starting to feel a little bit anxious actually
706828 i feel excited and im swimming good but im just anxious to get the ball rolling
706829 im trying not to think about the racing just yet
706830 beijing will be pretty mind blowing its going to be a great atmosphere there
706831 its my first olympic games so it will certainly be a different experience for me
706832 it will be an interesting time and one im sure i wont forget in a hurry
706833 my mum and dad are coming over but im not taking any special good luck charms
706834 im just going over there to do what i usually do and have fun
706835 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact upon the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
706836 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished the position to specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago
706837 unfortunately for consumers this shift has come at the expense of competition with smaller regional participants building societies credit unions and non bank lenders losing market share or being pushed out entirely
706838 access to sites in china is continually changing and chinese authorities are not transparent about the censorship process so it is a very difficult thing to keep track of
706839 it is hard to speak for anyone else but that was a relief for me
706840 i felt a lot of pressure during the week we had our backs against the wall there was pressure all week and it shows what wounded all blacks can do
706841 i was worried about it i was up every couple of hours because i had a heavy workload on thursday and friday and it flared up a bit i kept it to myself with some icing and a couple of pills and that seemed to do the trick
706842 doing myself proud and realising i am good enough to be here
706843 319 the gop have thrown everything they can at him in the last week with vicious roveian thugs having taken over mccains campaign schmidt primarily bullying and lying their way across the news some people fall for this in the short term if it is not responded too hence mccain being at the top of his 43 46 box and obama being at the lower end of his 46 49 box fortunately obama is not a weak campaigner like kerry and the gore that was having let them destroy mccains previous image in short order the next few weeks will see him respond in kind if mccain had continued a positive campaign then so would obama now i esxpect that he will go for the kill allowing his team to bring out all of mccains negatives that he has been storing up like the undead the new mccain team need to be destroyed literally destroyed they given any hope of reviving 323 on a similar subject crosbys negative campaign ruined howards chances there were stirrings upwards in the tory vote and polls after crosby started showed that disappearing 324 err you did note that the site is a right wing site didnt you not a very useful barometer

706863 meine mutter hat erst heftig reagiert dann haben wir geredet und ich habe ihr zeit gelassen jetzt ist alles gut
706864 ich wurde durch ein video geoutet aber die familie war total locker
706865 meine eltern waren total entspannt wir hatten berhaupt keine probleme miteinander damals mit 18 war ich in den sohn meines zahnarztes verliebt
706866 ich war s e 17 aber auch bei meinen eltern lief alles ganz locker ab stress hatte ich nicht
706867 wir haben haus an haus gewohnt bis wir gemerkt haben dass aus freundschaft liebe wurde dann haben wir unsere leben neu geordnet wir haben freunde verloren unsere familien aber nicht es war trotzdem eine harte zeit
706868 meine mutter meinte ich h tte mich schon viel fr her als mit 18 outen sollen denn das war immer klar sie war da total entspannt
706869 bei mir war es hnlich ich war schon immer so und meine mutter wusste es vor mir ich hatte damit auch nie probleme wieso auch
706870 wir sind seit 27 jahren ein paar als ich mich im freundeskreis geoutet habe war ich etwa 30 meine mutter wollte es aber bis zu ihrem tode nicht wahrhaben
706871 ich hatte es leichter meine drei schwestern wussten was mit mir los ist nach einer weile konnte meine mutter auch gut damit umgehen
706872 mein umfeld wusste es schon l ngst bevor ich mich geoutet habe dass ich m nner liebe aber sie wollten mir zeit lassen und mir die chance geben es selber zu sagen und den richtigen zeitpunkt daf r zu w hlen mit 29 habe ich es dann gesagt probleme hatte ich nicht es ging alles ganz einfach

706896 es ist sch n dass die leute in madrid von mir reden madrid ist ein sehr gro er klub und es ist klar dass die journalisten mir viel aufmerksamkeit schenken

706908 viele leute haben mich gefragt ob es nicht schwierig ist gegen teams zu spielen die mich verpflichten wollen
706909 weil ich gemerkt habe dass es ein problem w re ihn spielen zu lassen rafael war die letzten tage mental nicht bei hundert prozent

706914 there have been a couple moments in these first four exhibition games when chris paul fell asleep on defense though he certainly has made up for it at the offensive end
706915 that is poor defense by he is not a good on ball defender
706916 you almost sense in this game that these guys are ready to get to beijing more so than in any other game they are pretty much going through the motions
706917 you have to put yourself out there and prove yourself that youre in it for the long haul and not just some twitter spammer who follows everyone
706918 what i missed what i didnt want to miss what i caught and hated what i caught and liked
706919 knowing that 1700 people follow me on twitter doesnt phase me its actually kinda cool
706920 i dont like people to follow me unless ive met them

706936 mit den finnen haben wir irgendwie immer gl ck von mika h kkinen ber kimi r ikk nen bis jetzt zu heikki schade f r felipe wirklich es tut mir leid f r ihn und f r ferrari aber die aufgabe hei t halt ins ziel zu fahren ich kenne das wir sind auch schon auf siegesfahrt ausgefallen deshalb nehmen wir den sieg nat rlich sehr gerne
706937 ich glaube aber auch dass lewis ohne das reifenproblem eine sehr gute chance gehabt h tte wir waren vom timing jedenfalls genau richtig unterwegs um nach unserem sp teren boxenstopp noch nach vorne zu kommen wir waren da im plan insofern ist es vielleicht ein gewisser ausgleich
706938 es war eine absolut grandiose leistung von timo glock und toyota
706939 das ist wieder ein rennausgang den wir alle nicht erwartet haben
706940 absolut das gab es schon ein paar mal in diesem jahr es ist wirklich eine tolle weltmeisterschaft man muss auch sagen es war eine absolut grandiose leistung von timo glock und toyota der speed den sie gezeigt haben war richtig gut das war nicht irgendwie ein geerbter zweiter platz sondern ein echt verdienter
706941 ich freue mich sehr f r timo denn er ist den weg auch gegangen weil er von der deutschen post die unterst tzung gekriegt hat die sollen mal einen trinken heute abend denn das haben sich alle die an timo geglaubt haben verdient nach so kurzer zeit auf dem podium zu sein und einen zweiten platz nach hause zu fahren ist absolut aller ehren wert vor dem weltmeister kimi r ikk nen immerhin
706942 am ende wurde es zwischen den beiden noch mal richtig eng kimi hat riesenschritte zu timo gemacht wie kann so etwas passieren
706943 er hat aber dann auch wieder riesenschritte nach hinten gemacht ich bin sicher dass kimi ganz gl cklich war ins ziel gekommen zu sein so ganz souver n sah das am ende nicht mehr aus ich wei nicht was da war
706944 wir glauben dass ihn ferrari nach dem motorschaden von felipe massa aufgefordert hat tempo rauszunehmen
706945 vielleicht m glicherweise hat er auch ein anderes problem gehabt wie gesagt jetzt ist es so gekommen ohne den reifenschaden h tte lewis gewonnen so oder so aber heikki hat sich das verdient ich bin froh dass es gerade jetzt passiert ist wo wir ihn am donnerstag best tigt haben er f hrt in die erste startreihe und holt dann seinen ersten sieg das ist absolut toll und wohlverdient wir haben neue gesichter gesehen auf dem podium mit dem weltmeister aber der weltmeister war auf der niedrigsten der drei stufen ich denke das ist schon bemerkenswert
706946 in runde 41 hatte lewis seinen reifenschaden wie ist das passiert
706947 es kam aus heiterem himmel ich w rde jetzt auch nicht vorschnell sagen dass es von der reifenbelastung kommt oder was auch immer lewis f hrt am limit das tun die anderen auch aber man wei nicht woran es gelegen ist auf jeden fall hat ihn das in zweierlei hinsicht den sieg gekostet erstens waren wir vom speed her dazu in der lage und zweitens nach dem ausfall von massa sowieso
706948 mir ist aufgefallen dass lewis berall schnell war nur nicht beim anbremsen der zweiten kurve also hatte er beim bremsen nicht mehr das volle vertrauen oder
706949 ich habe mir das spekulieren abgew hnt es sah m glicherweise so aus m glicherweise ist das die begr ndung ob es da einen zusammenhang gibt muss man aber erst sehen
706950 lewis ist so etwas schon ein paar mal passiert in der t rkei im vergangenen jahr dieses jahr musste er in der t rkei dreimal stoppen auf anraten von bridgestone jetzt der vorfall heute wie kommt es dass immer er schwierigkeiten mit den reifen hat
706951 diesen r ckschluss w rde ich nicht ziehen die belastung die ein fahrer auf ein fahrzeug bringt auf den motor auf das chassis und auf die reifen die m ssen auszuhalten sein
706952 der schnellste markiert eben manchmal leistungsspitzen damit will ich unseren partner bridgestone berhaupt nicht misskreditieren das ist sport am limit man kann nicht sagen lewis ruiniert die reifen so rum ist es falsch er benutzt die reifen vielleicht wie kein anderer in diesem fall m ssen wir nachgucken was los war die zwei f lle in der t rkei da hatte das eine mit dem anderen sicherlich nichts zu tun
706953 we are citizens of the world sen obama told thousands of nonvoting germans during his recent tour of the middle east and europe and if the global poverty act s 2433 he has sponsored becomes law which is almost certain if he wins in november were also going to be taxpayers of the world obamas global poverty act offers us a global socialist destiny we do not want one that challenges americas very sovereignty obama would give them all a fish without teaching them how to fish pledging to cut global poverty in half on the backs of u s taxpayers is a ridiculous and impossible goal in an obama white house american sovereignty will become an endangered species the global poverty act is the first toe in the water of global socialism
706954 however faintly as we each seek to claim disputed territory
706955 democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
706956 although barack obama and john mccain try to offer solutions to help america break from conventional thinking on educational policy both senators are missing key pieces to the puzzle of why our public schools are failing in an article that ran recently in the los angeles times mccain told the naacp i want to reward good teachers mccains education platform is built on merit pay for teachers and school vouchers for families who would like to trade in their students failing schools for private schools

706986 the fee penalises those who need television the most small families and the elderly and infirm at a time when the salaries of top bbc executives and presenters is at an all time disproportionate high

707023 after a surprising drop in the number of people employed in june we expect the canadian labour market to rebound modestly in july and add 10 000 jobs to the employment ranks
707024 despite the expected turnaround in the canadian labour market in july the sluggish pace of canadian economic activity will continue to limit the extent of any employment gains going forward
707025 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
707026 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
707027 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
707028 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
707029 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
707030 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
707031 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
707032 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
707033 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
707034 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
707035 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
707036 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
707037 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
707038 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
707039 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
707040 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
707041 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
707042 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
707043 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
707044 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
707045 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
707046 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
707047 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
707048 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
707049 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
707050 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
707051 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
707052 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
707053 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
707054 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
707055 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
707056 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
707057 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
707058 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
707059 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
707060 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
707061 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
707062 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
707063 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
707064 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
707065 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
707066 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
707067 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
707068 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
707069 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
707070 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
707071 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
707072 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
707073 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
707074 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
707075 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
707076 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
707077 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
707078 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
707079 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
707080 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
707081 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
707082 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
707083 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
707084 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
707085 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
707086 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
707087 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
707088 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
707089 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
707090 it was the best way for sir alex to get it off the agenda with the media
707091 its not our call and well wait and see weve always thought that fraizers a great talent and thats why were interested in him and personally i dont think its over yet and certainly it will be done or not done within the next few weeks
707092 ive had a lengthy conversation with sir alex on friday and hes promised hell keep me up to speed with things
707093 valves survival horror game left 4 dead is coming to ps3 but ea will be taking on development duties in house
707094 9 the drip of a leaky faucet keeps time with the throbbing heat that is steadily stiffening my neck and shooting down to my forearm
707095 participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
707096 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
707097 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
707098 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
707099 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
707100 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
707101 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
707102 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression
707103 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
707104 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
707105 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
707106 we expect a contact between mr solana and mr jalili soon by phone
707107 the other two should also come one after the other in the next 45 days
707108 the two pacts need to be signed since we are buying a lot of defence equipment from the us now like the deal finalized for six c 130j super hercules aircraft for 962 45 million
707109 we dont have problems with safeguards when sensitive technology is being transferred to us but we dont want anything which is intrusive and unnecessary we have a spotless record in not letting high technology leak to third parties
707110 even after the latest 10 hike we are far from being out of the woods another 15 hike is needed along with structural reforms the latter include cost cutting by rationalizing flights tax reforms on jet fuel pricing temporary relief in landing parking and navigation charges and a freeze on any increase in airport charges especially at new private airports
707111 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
707112 good weather has a great deal to do with the natural conditions but whether this can be maintained has a lot to do with our pollution control measures because they also have a lot to do with the improvement
707113 we will not only host a quality and unique games but build a more scenic greener and more civilised city in a sustainable manner
707114 the conditions you were working in on tuesday were not good
707115 i am not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for we are not running the internet in china
707116 i am sure that come the 9th of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organisation will take over
707117 the next 3 4 years shall see intense activity at both the coasts i am sure you would well appreciate the significance of these operations to enhance oil and production in the country at a time when oil prices have reached unprecedented levels in the global markets
707118 agreed that if the vessel is well maintained and meeting statutory requirements of seaworthiness then the age of the vessel becomes immaterial
707119 the availability of vessels is precarious due to increased demand which is triggered by spurt in oil prices therefore it will not be possible to engage new vessels even at higher prices this shall seriously hamper the offshore construction works and will adversely affect oil and gas production
707120 tuve roces con algunas personas como tambi n no los tuve con otras y eso me hizo un poco m s fuerte y me hizo dar cuenta de que realmente se puede tener afinidades fuertes dentro de la casa por m s de que haya estado quince d as
707121 me comport como me comporto afuera no entr con ninguna estrategia armada ni nada por el estilo sino que fui a ser
707122 my life at the moment is going through such a hectic pace that i would rather chill out at home no news would be good news at this juncture and making no plans would really make me happy i just hope to have a very uneventful birthday
707123 i am sure but nysa hasnt revealed these plans to me yet batayegi batayegi
707124 i wish for peace in my heart and peace in our country these ongoing blasts across the nation have disturbed me a lot
707125 when you do a particular film you dont have awards in mind but yes it definitely feels good when you are called as the best amongst your peers and awarded for the same i wouldnt say that i dont aspire for a national award but i dont sign films just to get awards
707126 i think people have forgotten about actresses like meena kumari saira banu etc who did even better after marriage than before i am not the sole exception
707127 as the name suggests its a cartoon film and we will have a lot of live characters in it i cant reveal more than that you will have to watch this film to know more
707128 i dont have an objection to any role as long as it clicks in my head
707129 nobody has come to me with such a proposal but if something good comes along why not i really dont know whether i will be good at it because despite being a chatterbox i am not a very public person
707130 no i am not scared darna tha toh tab darti jab bollywood main enter kiya tha with legacy of my mom maasi and granny behind me i take my work seriously but it doesnt affect my nerves
707131 talking about race in this context of a political campaign i think is the worst thing
707132 the charge yesterday that obama had introduced and played the race card was so over the top by the mccain campaign i mean it was truly it boggled the mind and it went beyond any concept of rationality
707133 now did he raise the race issue the race issue is with him every day of his life when you see his picture the race issue is there
707134 it is perhaps easy to understand how some have accepted without question the claims of conservative activists that their movement was and still in color blind and unassociated with class politics indeed in the suburbs with no other colors in sight and no other classes in contention such claims seem plausible how could modern conservatism be shaped by forces that werent there

707136 he felt ok looked a little rusty thats to be expected
707137 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
707138 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
707139 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
707140 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done
707141 we do things outside the realm of news but it gives an image to the viewers that we care
707142 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
707143 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
707144 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
707145 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
707146 we have to start teaching these young kids that are getting on the internet and writing these things to be careful about the words theyre using
707147 one kid told us a really scary story about how he was bullied every day because he walked home i guess these kids pushed him down in the street in the bushes and stuff so we talked to him and last time we found out he was getting help from his teacher to try to stop the bullying
707148 she is not feeling well get a urine sample and i will take it to the office with me
707149 had forced the majority of the iraqi doctors to abandon their hospitals and clinics
707150 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
707151 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
707152 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
707153 the vision is to figure out how to re establish the connection between individuals and their natural environments and reconnect families in the process
707154 think of the traffic and the noise and light until we know how many houses are being proposed its hard to know what the impact will be
707155 they own the land and they can do what they want with it
707156 we need a business to keep people here not drive people away
707157 its a little difficult when you dont have direct contact with the landowners
707158 this is a significant change whether you like it or not
707159 we want to be a good neighbor and partner and were trying to find ways to do that
707160 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
707161 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
707162 we will raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
707163 im running for this office because i want to make life better i dont think rep kilpatrick has done a good enough job
707164 anybody who goes to congress can bring home the dollars

707168 although ive had a relatively glitch free experience lots of other users around the country have complained of frequent at amp t network outages dropped calls and sometimes slower than molasses connectivity
707169 german tech mag area dvd have published a test of the iphone 3g they said their device serial production not part of a seeding had serious trouble maintaining a stable signal even 300 meters unobstructed view from the celltowers 500 meters from the celltower within a building they could hardly get any 3g signal at the same time their nokia e61i worked fine with full bars reception
707170 apple iphone 3g when you are outside and next to a cell tower but even then dont expect full 3g
707171 we understand that some users are reporting 3g reception issues and we are looking into this
707172 yeah i have an idea of what the problem is
707173 religious studies and theology exploring sustainable development challenges for higher education
707174 this job is important and needs to be done by someone with experience
707175 ill listen to both sides ill listen and hear all the arguments
707176 its time we brought to that office that kind of experience
707177 you cant buy that and you cant smile your way through it
707178 im concerned about juveniles our children are our future and if we dont take care of the children were sunk
707179 a district court judge presides over cases and do you know how easy it is for an error to occur in a case
707180 that doesnt make him a bad man but if that happened at trial it could constitute reversible error
707181 land in wyoming is cheap but copper wire is expensive
707182 we were able to obtain a nice piece of land but there were no utilities to it it suited both my temperament and my inclinations and it was practical in terms of initial cost for building to not run the utilities here
707183 the nearest phone lines are across the highway and they would have to go under it which would be very expensive
707184 the nearest power lines were a mile away at the time
707185 we looked at it and thought we could probably be self sufficient
707186 we have full sun 300 days a year and no shortage of wind no sir
707187 around here very few people have gone off the grid but in the 1930s it was perfectly common
707188 people that want to go off grid but are using typically american amounts of resources are going to find it almost impossible
707189 the trick really is to address consumption first when you do that you may find that you dont need the solar panels or the wind turbine because you are already saving 80 percent on your power bill at that point if you want to add something you only need a few solar panels to make a big difference
707190 the glory of living out here is how easy it is
707191 we dont really have to do very much out here except fix the wind turbine once in a while it is quite civilized and easy to live with
707192 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
707193 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
707194 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them
707195 they have discovered water on mars for the third or fourth time
707196 were not doing as many rehabs and we have very limited capacity to maintain and clean the stations we do have
707197 we really do not have the funding to do a first class job
707198 this brings a lot of closure it may not have brought the closure that others may have wanted to see this person face justice as opposed to take his own life but i think they have the right person
707199 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
707200 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable
707201 but actually the jaish al mahdi had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
707202 i dont think we want to live in a country where people are working and doing what they are supposed to do but yet they cant get the basics
707203 this is an economy where people are on edge about things like downsizing and getting laid off and heres a guy who has wielded that knife
707204 we tried to look for ideas in every choice that we make in our homes hoping that everyone who goes through it will be inspired to make some change on some level
707205 some people will walk away and want to do an entire new home or some people will think when they go for their towels next and go for organic linens
707206 it is happening but the industry needs to do a better job of getting information into peoples hands when theyre looking for it
707207 i like not making a negative impact on the earth
707208 its got so much to be said for it because it uses nature and natural materials
707209 its open you bring the outside in and you can even bring the inside out its a house built for humans its plausible in real life
707210 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly
707211 one of the things thats fundamental to green building is that it can look like anything it can be a regular craftsman house or a cape cod house in new england or an adobe house in santa fe you dont have to change what the home looks like to make it green
707212 but we hope people will make informed decisions when theyre building when theyre renovating
707213 once i can see in real time how my behavior translates to my usage i can make changes
707214 if youre very clever if youre a do it yourself kind of person you can do one room at a time and achieve your ultimate goal
707215 its no longer a question if people want to go green or not they do
707216 theres all of these things that weve been learning over the course of the last two years that were now trying to put into practice and we want to do that on a sustained basis
707217 its a small thing to have to deal with in the grand scheme
707218 the first new thing in real estate in a while
707219 houses are more tightly sealed than in the past and contain a higher percentage of synthetic materials and products versus natural products
707220 i visualise myself with a woman who will stand beside me in our garden in our small humble house off the grid that weve built ourselves living life simply
707221 i would specifically like to put out an invitation to a woman who fits the bill for who im looking for in my life
707222 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
707223 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
707224 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
707225 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
707226 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
707227 the scientific community is really going to run with this
707228 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

707235 dari muhammad bin ali dia berkata bagi mahdi kita ada 2 tanda yang belum pernah terjadi semenjak diciptakan

707237 this is the book in it is guidance sure without doubt to those who fear allah
707238 surely we have revealed the reminder and we will most surely be its guardian
707239 and if ye are in doubt concerning that which we reveal unto our slave muhammad then produce a surah of the like thereof and call your witness beside allah if ye are truthful
707240 will they not then ponder on the quran if it had been from other than allah they would have found therein much incongruity
707241 and it is we who have constructed the heaven with might and verily it is we who are steadily expanding it
707242 you will see the mountains you reckoned to be solid going pass like clouds such is the artistry of god who disposes of all things in perfect order for he is well acquainted with all that ye do
707243 and he it is who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon
707244 and the sun runs his course for a period determined for him that is the decree of him the exalted in might the all knowing
707245 the hour of judgment is nigh and the moon is cleft asunder
707246 and when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide

707254 tiada sempurna iman salah seorang dari kamu sehingga ia mencintai sesama muslim sebagaimana ia telah mencintai dirinya sendiri
707255 perumpamaan orang orang mukmin dalam cinta mencintai kasih mengasihi dan rahmat merahmati adalah bagaikan satu badan apabila salah satu anggota badannya menderita sakit maka menjalarlah penderitaan itu ke seluruh badan hingga terasa panas dan tidak dapat tidur
707256 rasulullah saw bersabda ada tiga hal yang siapa saja di dalamnya tentu akan merasakan lezatnya iman apabila allah dan rasul nya lebih ia cintai daripada yang lain mencintai seseorang hanya karena allah dan benci kepada kekafiran laksana ia benci untuk dicampakkan kepada neraka

707272 the fccs decision today underscores the importance of internet freedom for consumers and entrepreneurs i have introduced bipartisan legislation the internet freedom preservation act h r 5353 with rep chip pickering r miss to establish a policy framework for resolving this critical issue and to ensure that consumers and entrepreneurs are protected against unreasonable interference or discrimination from broadband network providers
707273 going forward i believe todays fcc action sends a strong message to the industry that the commission intends to take internet freedom principles seriously and will act to protect the integrity and openness of internet commerce and communications
707274 for its part i understand that comcast has already begun efforts to modify its network management approach and i believe its efforts to treat content providers in a more nondiscriminatory way from a network management standpoint are laudable and welcome i intend to continue monitoring practices in the industry and pressing for passage of my legislative framework for addressing these issues in the months ahead

707279 every time the children had a bike race philip would take off full speed quickly leave others behind and then almost at the finish line slow down stop and calmly look around smiling he had enjoyed the race knew that he could finish first but victory over others did not interest him in the least
707280 they were real lacking ulterior motives and reflecting who he was from very early age
707281 not rebelling against authority on principle he did not accept diktat and refused to follow directions blindly if he did not see logic in them
707282 he would fix fragile objects use threadlike parts and nimbly manipulate minuscule pieces one could see only with a magnifying glass when he was working on a project the resemblance to his grandfather was amazing
707283 to grandparents from philip three and a half years old
707284 retrospectively it seems as if he were in a hurry to accomplish as much as he could as if he knew how little time he had
707285 his short life reminds of a vector directed towards a single point
707286 which in israeli army slang means that he loved his work to the point of obsession
707287 he simply couldnt afford not to know how to behave in a particular situation

707304 i think that an objective analysis of his speeches voting record and past policy initiatives will reveal barack obama to not be left of center as my brother believes but to be far left you may ask far left of what what will form a baseline standard for evaluating his policies relative to what do i consider barack to be on the far left and my answer put simply is the constitution the real contract with america that should form the basis of all political discourse and policy building is the constitution every elected official swears to uphold it i believe that what obama has in mind for the country is extreme i hope to show by constitutional standards that on the issues in which he should want an assertion of government power the protecting of innocent human life that obama is on the extreme wrong end of the spectrum and that on issues in which he should desire a shrinking of government and infringement of federal power into our daily lives obama is again on the extreme wrong end of the spectrum

707330 a well known incident in early islamic history well exemplifies this principle in the war of persia a persian general presumably a zoroastrian y s disguised himself and sought refuge with a muslim soldier when his identity was discovered and the matter of his punishment arose the general of the muslim army hazrat abu ubaida ibn al jarrah heard that a muslim soldier had given him shelter he saved the life of the persian because to respect the promise of a muslim is a duty for all other muslims i assure my non muslim countrymen that if they enter into a just and fair pact with the muslims and implement it sincerely and do not resort to political intrigues they will find the muslims fully loyal and good intentioned neighbours because the muslims in accordance with the commandments of the holy quran are duty bound to fulfill their agreements the holy quran says that muslims must honour all pacts that they have entered into with the non muslims till the term of those treaties is over provided the latter too abide by the terms of the treaties and do not assist anyone against the muslims and allah says in the holy quran that if the non muslims deal fairly with the muslims the latter too must deal fairly with them undoubtedly the holy quran says god is the friend of those who practice forbearance respected ulama on this occasion there is another issue which one must consider one that is often the cause of much misunderstanding this relates to the rules of the shariat these rules are of three types those that concern the abode of islam dar ul islam those related to the abode of peace dar ul aman and those related to the abode of war dar ul harb we need to consider in which one of these three categories india today finds herself as far as the principles of the shariat are concerned at best india can be considered to be the abode of peace because at present there appears to be no possibility of enforcing the rules of the abode of islam here our revered shaikh ul mashaikh hazrat maulana shah abdul aziz muhaddith dehlawi a leading eighteenth century alim of delhi has said that under the present circumstances india cannot be considered to be an abode of islam in the event of india not being an abode of islam today our duty is to search the books of our religion to see which rules apply for the abode of peace and in the light of those commandments fulfill our duty of guiding the muslims of india although in this short speech i cannot elaborate on all the commandments that apply to the abode of peace it is necessary that i should make some suggestions in this regard it is best that i draw your attention to some sections of the pact that the last prophet of allah hazrat muhammad may peace and allahs blessing be upon him entered into with the jews of medina after he migrated there by studying those sections of the treaty you will be able to understand what sort of agreement muslims can enter into with non muslims in the abode of peace or the abode of war the pact between the holy prophet muhammad may peace and allahs blessings be upon him and the jews of medina as the treaty is very lengthy i shall simply present those sections of it that are related to the point i wish to make in the name of allah the most merciful the most compassionate this is a treaty of muhammad the prophet of allah may peace and allahs blessings be upon him and the muslims and those people who have entered into an agreement with them as allies all parties to this agreement muslims from mecca and medina and those jews who have signed the treaty will be considered as one party jamaat and one community qaum as against other non muslims and those who have not entered into this agreement it is binding on the muslims that they should oppose those who try to create strife and oppress and persecute the creatures of god all muslims must unite and act against such people even though the latter may be their own sons it is binding on the muslims that they should help those jews who have entered into this agreement with us and behave kindly with them and save them from oppression and not help any oppressor against them it is their islamic duty for muslims to remain true to their pledge and exhibit the highest standards of morality possible the jews of the tribe of banu awf are allies of the muslims and have entered into a treaty with them the jews will be free to practise their own religion and the muslims will be free to practise theirs in matters other than religion the jews of the tribe of banu awf and the muslims will be considered one party and those who resort to oppression violate this treaty or commit any crime will be liable for punishment after this the holy prophet muhammad may peace and allahs blessings be upon him mentioned the names of various other jewish tribes who had also entered into the treaty such as the tribes of banu al najjar banu al harith banu saidah banu jusham and banu al

707351 tidak boleh dikatakan kaif sebab kaif itu terangkat mustahil bagi allah
707352 maksudnya ialah tidak boleh dibayang bayangkan bagaimana bentuk dan modelnya sifat allah itu inilah mazhab salaf adz dzahabi mengutip pernyataan imam malik tentang hadis hadis sifat
707353 ucapan kami dalam masalah ini menerimanya memberlakukannya dan menyerahkan maknanya kepada penyabdanya yang mashum
707354 kami beriman kepada ayat ayat yang mutasyaabihaat semuanya itu dari sisi tuhan kami
707355 ibnu hajar sendiri cenderung mendukung poendapat tafw dh ia berkata
707356 ibnu daq qil ied berkata kami berpendapat tentang sifat sifat yang musykil bahwa ia benar dan haq sesuai dengan makna yang dikehendaki allah maka barang siapa menawilnya kami akan perhatikan tawilnya jika ia dekat dengan penggunaan bahasa arab kami tidak menentangnya jika jauh menyimpang maka kami berhenti dan kembali kepada hanya mengimaninya dengan meniadakan penyerupaan tanz h
707357 maka jelaslah bahwa ucapan ahli tafw dh yang mengaku aku mengikuti sunnah dan para salaf adalah sejelek jeleknya ucapan ahli bidah dan kaum pengingkar tuhan ilh d
707358 dengannya kita mengetahui kesesatan atau kebohongan mereka yang berkata mazhab salaf adalah tafw dh mereka sesat jika mengatakannya dengan dasar kebodohan akan thariqah salaf dan mereka berbohong jika mereka menyengaja memalsu ringkas kata tidak diragukan bahwa mereka yang berkata bahwa mazhab ahlusunnah adalah tafw dh telah salah sebab mazhab ahlusunnah adalah menetapkan makna apa adanya seperti telah disinggung sebelumnya abu salafy dan menyerahkan kaif ketahuilah bahwa tafw dh seperti dikatakan syeikhul islam ibnu taimiyah adalah sejelek jeleknya ucapan ahli bidah dan pengingkar tuhan

707367 the industries most likely to be affected by the sharp rise in transportation costs are those producing heavy or bulky goods that are particularly expensive to ship relative to their sale price steel is an example chinas steel exports to the united states are now tumbling by more than 20 percent on a year over year basis their worst performance in a decade while american steel production has been rising after years of decline motors and machinery of all types car parts industrial presses refrigerators television sets and other home appliances could also be affected
707368 the spike in shipping costs comes at a moment when concern about the environmental impact of globalization is also growing many companies have in recent years shifted production from countries with greater energy efficiency and more rigorous standards on carbon emissions especially in europe to those that are more lax like china and india o avoid having to ship all its products from abroad the swedish furniture manufacturer ikea opened its first factory in the united states in may some electronics companies that left mexico in recent years for the lower wages in china are now returning to mexico because they can lower costs by trucking their output overland to american consumers
707369 but with transportation costs rising more wood is now going to traditional domestic furniture making centers in north carolina and virginia where the industry had all but been wiped out while the opening of the american ikea plant in danville va a traditional furniture producing center hit hard by the outsourcing of production to asia is perhaps most emblematic of such changes other manufacturers are also shifting some production back to the united states

707464 by speaking out i hope we encouraged people to put more effort into keeping northern rock open
707465 the attitude was why should we take this lying down
707466 northern rock had given a lot to the community so people wanted to give something back by showing support
707467 what was interesting was that people in the region became aware of their own power
707468 in previous decades there would have been the supposition that northern rock would have had to close and all the jobs would have to be lost
707469 local mps got involved in the fight and the message was put very forcibly to the government in london
707470 of course some people were not happy and some of the feedback we got said northern rock should be allowed to die
707471 but you can still believe in a free market and believe it was right to save northern rock
707472 with hindsight there was no sense at the time that the board was acting recklessly in any way
707473 it may have looked like mr applegarth got out at the right time but there have been big failures in the city of london who have been generously rewarded and no one raises criticism
707474 there has been a lot of hot air around northern rock in my opinion the fsa checks were not stringent enough they failed to look closely enough at northern rock
707475 there are a lot of things up here where northern rock has played a big role in the community
707476 things are not going to be the same on sponsorship that is for sure
707477 the football club will find other sponsors but the question would be what about the rugby club their ground is also owned by northern rock
707478 without backing from northern rock it would have to examine how it can continue they may have to look to a more utilitarian approach with stars
707479 people in the region think nationalisation is a holding position
707480 and nobody really knows where this will go next or indeed if northern rock will survive in the long term
707481 i dont think we are at the end of the beginning because nobody really knows where this will go
707482 when the round of redundancies is completed there will be a remaining workforce of about 4 000 there are currently vacancies in the financial sector in the north east that may be able to take up some of the people who are losing their jobs
707483 it is a better scenario compared to the one where we might have had 5 000 plus jobs going
707484 we think the lobbying of politicians and the chancellor was helpful and i also believe that going into nationalisation saved the company
707485 however we can now look to the future it is important to focus on that from both a commercial and morale point of view
707486 one of the things we found out about northern rock was how much people in the region looked at it as though it was their business it is a big part of the north east
707487 it is part of the regional culture the regional mps recognised that was the case as much as the value of the company job losses had to be kept to a minimum
707488 i think the rest of the country did not quite realise how important it was to the region
707489 the case of northern rock has been overshadowed by what has come afterwards

707521 i had it three times last year or whatever and thats what lost me the championship
707522 it can be very very costly but the fact kimi didnt win heikki did and timo glock was second means im quite happy because they have taken points off everyone else
707523 above all its been a great day for heikki i know what it feels like to get your first grand prix win its a very special day for him

707554 as a practical john maszka i think youre absolutely correct sandy maliga im voting republican because it
707555 in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks and the anthrax scare that followed who could not have imagined the worst and contemplated extraordinary efforts to prevent it
707556 the legal doctrine that addington espoused the the president as commander in chief had the authority to disregard virtually all previously known legal boundaries if national security demanded it rested on a reading of the constitution that few legal scholars shared

707560 these figures though shocking come as no surprise because of the highly stressful nature of the profession we have consistently argued for the need for greater support and intervention in order to improve the well being of scottish teachers
707561 for these reasons despite a lack of any funding teacher support scotland will be launching its 24 7 support line and online services this month the experience of teachers in england and wales who already have access to similar services is that our coaching and counselling can alleviate the symptoms of common mental health problems
707562 it is of little surprise that the number of reported cases of stress is so large in light of the workload of teachers and the conditions in which many teachers have to work
707563 unsteady on his feet had glassy eyes and his breath smelled of alcohol
707564 probably he was upset because he lost his wallet and had a couple of drinks that night
707565 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
707566 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
707567 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
707568 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
707569 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
707570 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
707571 and i believe fundamentally that in 1980 the election was all about ronald reagan
707572 people did not want another four years of jimmy carter but they were not clear or comfortable for much of the way with whether reagan got over the bar of acceptability to be commander in chief and president of the united states
707573 are you better off now than you were four years ago

707611 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight they seek to persuade others about it a healthy church gives space for such exchanges

707619 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
707620 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
707621 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
707622 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
707623 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
707624 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
707625 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
707626 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
707627 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
707628 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
707629 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
707630 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
707631 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
707632 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
707633 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
707634 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
707635 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
707636 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
707637 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
707638 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
707639 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
707640 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
707641 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
707642 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
707643 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
707644 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
707645 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
707646 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
707647 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
707648 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
707649 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
707650 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

707723 to finish with a birdie was special there didnt seem to be any doubt it was going in
707724 im always trying to win more than one but this is what happened this year and im really disappointed
707725 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
707726 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
707727 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
707728 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
707729 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
707730 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
707731 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
707732 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
707733 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
707734 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
707735 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
707736 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
707737 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
707738 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
707739 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
707740 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
707741 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
707742 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
707743 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
707744 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
707745 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
707746 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
707747 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
707748 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
707749 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

707753 by far the sharpest debate this sunday was between john mccain and his own surrogates
707754 since john mccain himself has been trying to have it both ways on the social security payroll tax its no surprise that his surrogates are confused about which position to defend no amount of double talk can change the fact that john mccain is promising more of the same failed policies that have left americans struggling under the failed bush mccain economy
707755 senator mccain believes you cannot tax your way into social security solvency if you want to deal with social security youve got to deal with all the moving parts that is whether or not you allow young people to invest uh have an account in their own name do you adjust the age do you adjust reschedule the benefits based on upper income people john is not going to tax our way into solvency because it will ruin the american economy but to raise taxes to save social security from bankruptcy wont happen its a dumb idea
707756 hes making his position very clear which is payroll tax increases are not the solution he has been consistent in that position for the last many many months even as his opponent has proposed increases in payroll taxes
707757 last september he was forced to defend his refusal to sign a no new tax pledge offered by the conservative americans for tax reform
707758 meeting with us last december before the primaries he declared that

707769 i am a hard nut to crack and harder still to kill ill live through just about anything the pirates wish to throw at me and survive though they may not
707770 shall i entreat a squire to fetch us some draught of wine that we might ease our thirst
707771 mayhaps but i have been called before the prince so i would deem it fit that i have cider instead
707772 nay i do not drink this eve i have received word that i may be asked to leave soon and would not wish to have had anything to drink if i must be out for the ocean has shown some evil signs of late and the weather does not look clean
707773 yes you dear fellow fetch three goblets of cider if you would
707774 i have never taken a liking to the northern ciders common to mine own homeland but assuredly the princes draught exceeds it
707775 my tastes are somewhat more common than yours helorondur you forget i was not accustomed to such things when i first came to dol amroth
707776 as my school master always said in matters of whimsy tis noble to wave in the breeze in matters of honor tis best to stand firm as a rock
707777 indeed you school master was an intelligent fellow more bard it sounds like that master
707778 yes i believe we have you are one of the men at arms of the swan company are you not
707779 ive always maintained he was fascinating but perhaps not wise
707780 yes i remember now valkros you are newly come to the city are you not
707781 where is our gracious captain that man known as rinkair of pelargir
707782 my valorous captain i hope not that thine sails have fallen idle or the winters wind too wild in your stay in our citadel this mound of amroth by the sea
707783 we have not suffered prince from either the winters winds nor from idleness we have stayed within your bay and still maintained our skills within its quiet shelter my men and i have been most graciously received within your honorable abode and found the welcome wanting in nothing there is little more we could ask for my lord
707784 but surely there is some gift that i may give you for it has always been the fashion that deeds of valour should not go unrewarded well i remember you at the helm of your vessel standing their heedless of dart or blade when none other would
707785 nay mlord no such gift is necessary i am merely doing the job that the steward entrusted to me the same duty that called me to serve my lands need and to follow my own love of the ocean my lord your praise is gift enough and i thank you for the thought itself
707786 thy words are elixir to my heart for surely here is a man both of courage and humility
707787 captain i have summoned you here for i need your service again yet i beg that you wait for a moment for i must speak with my knights who but lately returned from a quest perilous
707788 i await your words prince and am in no hurry to depart your gracious citadel the ocean can wait for my return until it is time for me to do so
707789 hail noble swan knights word has come of the success of thine mission already maedhromir son of tirion has returned to me that object of which you sought yet even more so i would ask you both to tell your tale of the bravery you had done on this most secret mission
707790 we have great reason to praise both the knight captain who led us forth into the southernn seas sir maedhromir who became unto us a pilot charting the course through perilous waters
707791 alas that we could not use the alcarondas on this mission yet it had to be so pray continue
707792 i speak truly that most honor was won that day by a soldier of the swan company who risked himself to rescue the knight captain from grave peril
707793 well enough the leeches would have it that i have three broken ribs but i maintain that they are but bent aye but were it not for lieutenant beladan and lord helorondur i would even now be in the larder of a foul serpent
707794 we had just begun to search for your objective and had come across some fissures which emitted a foul stench it was among these that we met with our first challenge for up until that time our progress had been sure and safe thanks to the skill of lord maedhromir
707795 you speak of a first challenge what other perils did you face
707796 there were others but we shall speak of them anon as i say we had come across these noxious fissures when fortune tread to dash our hopes for suddenly as if spewed up from some dark hole far beneath the surface a great and terrible serpent arose spitting out darkness and death in my recklessness i drew my sword and strove to smite the beast but its scales turned aside my blade and quick as lightning it had entwined itself about me my shield feel from my hands and was lost deep within that crevice and my arms were pinioned to my sides i still retained my sword but it was useless and the awful strength of that foul beast was slowly squeezing the last breath from me i strove to free my knife a gift from my father and managed to wedge it into the coils allowing the beast to stab itself somewhat and it was this which gave me a few moments more of breath and then as one helorondur and beladan attacked
707797 it would have gone ill nevertheless for the beasts scales were impervious to any attack of mortal hand or mortal steel
707798 there are many strange creatures in the world for good or evil and yet i am glad that you only suffered slightly as it seems what happened after your encounter with the dread beast
707799 mine stroke was merely in response to the insight of one of the soldiers who counseled to strike at those foul lidless eyes but in truth i wonder whether some force not my own aided me for the beast was sorely difficult to slay
707800 after the fight with that creature was over we proceeded into the shafts of the volcano where the ultimate goal of our quest lay
707801 the heart of a volcano surely this thing did not lie among the rivers of fire that layeth in the mountains heart
707802 nay my lord prince but near enough for my liking it was kept deep underground in a side passage one crafted long ere our fathers left numenor if i judge aright we found it after some backtracking and made our way out of the tunnels with safety and then we headed back to the ship but on our way we were attacked by a small but determined band of southrons we dealt with them quickly but being less well armored a small number of them made ready to flee had they done so our mission might have ended with an umbar fleet even now in our bay but by good fortune the small party of scouts i had detailed to watch our retreat managed to trap them and we closed on them as a hammer on an anvil no southron will return to umbar with tales of our quest it was again that helorondur and beladan showed great courage and strength i was weakened mightily by my encounter and while the knights and men at arms fought valiantly it was by these two mens commands and not my own for i was barely able to defend myself against the common rabble who oppressed me sir maedhromir acquitted himself well of course as did the rest of my men whom i would like to publicly commend for the way in which they carried out this mission we lost no lives and returned apace with that which we sought
707803 they may yet arrive i would not count them out even though the tale does not come from the southrons
707804 if you spend your time at your studies rather than sneaking about the court then perhaps you would know
707805 but father studying is so boring and gilian promised to take me riding today
707806 then go daughter and find a spring flower to bring to your father
707807 the southrons are ever the curse upon our age save that of the black land to the east
707808 you have done well valiant thanes and you shall be honoured rise
707809 i hereby invest thine valour and recognize its achievement with the silver falcon
707810 by grace and good fortune may the light shine upon thee forever
707811 my eternal gratitude for the praise thou hast shown me
707812 and now to the new issue at hand captain rinkair my thanks for being so patient with us for it is our custom in the court of dol amroth to recount such deeds of valour i am sure it is the same in your own land
707813 poor indeed would i be to be either disrespectful of the need to hear such tales and to see their bearers suitably rewarded for their valour or to hold it against you the need you must fulfill to your people as their prince and consider it an inconvenience to await your pleasure for it is only fitting that the needs of your people come first as i said before i am pleased to await your pleasure
707814 then my pleasure good captain is that i desire the transport of a certain gift to the lord steward of the realm i knowest that your ship is one geared for war but i hope that for this instance you may indulge me
707815 indeed it is not unheard of for my ship to either carry or escort gifts and cargos to the steward or from him
707816 the tides turn within a few hours and we can safely depart err then or after as mlord needs we have oars so we can depart at any time my prince merely gives us the order to leave when we must and we shall do shall we accompanying another ship or carrying the gift ourselves mlord
707817 perhaps another ship may be more suited whence you see what our gift is it is prepared if you desire to see it
707818 indeed mlord i would be honored to see that which you would ask us to make sure arrives safely to the stewards keeping
707819 i give to denethor entertainment these maidens are the fairest in the land and can provide fair music and dance at his court when last i saw him his mood was dark and i hope that such a gift may raise his spirits the only condition is that they are not bound in service to me or others i have but patroned them to this service and when their contract ends they may go whither they will
707820 nay my prince a most worthy and fitting gesture is this i am merely astounded by their beauty
707821 indeed they are i shall miss them yet you at least will have some time yet to watch them
707822 indeed mlord i assume that you have then found arrangements for their accommodations for my own ship as you have said is a ship of war and poor accommodations for such as these
707823 indeed all is taken care of and escort shall be sent with them helorondur take a company of men you are to go to the city and thence assure their safety yet also we have other purpose for you going
707824 it is ever my pleasure to carry out thine bidding my lord
707825 i am ready mlord will you be accompanying the dancers or does duty require you stay here with your people for a while yet before coming minas tirith
707826 i think captain that i shall not go long have i neglected my duties here in belfalas and i shall not go forth again unless at great need
707827 i shall go down to my ship then and we shall prepare for departure mlord
707828 rather may he protect us from the oceans wrath should she feel neglected mlord
707829 i hope that she can protect us much go with good and fair wind
707830 my lord captain that has been arranged i have ordered the necessary rites be performed as soon as you wish
707831 it was my good fortune to meet a maiden of pelargir who was visiting and i asked her for her kind assistance she waits without
707832 my thanks lord ithilir you have the foresight of your ancestors may you always have fair skies
707833 let us depart valkros ensure that our company is well provisioned with the necessities
707834 well met friend i trust you will treat our cargo well
707835 i will be merely keeping watch over the ship that takes them where it must my friend and of course i will treat them well when we reach minas tirith
707836 no one doubts your skill and worth but keep a tight rein on the sailors they rarely lay eyes on such beauties as imrahil has graced the steward with when do you depart
707837 now we shall not wait for in this way the temptation will be gone all the faster from my men and from the others of the ship that will carry the ladies to minas tirith
707838 see to it that the harbor master knows of master rinkairs departure after that you may go off duty i thank thee for thine service
707839 indeed may the winds blow at your back and your enemy be blinded
707840 good wind and weather to you captain i could not forgive you if this precious cargo was in any way damaged
707841 i tried to find anybody who knew anybody who took medicaid
707842 dentists and physicians are dropping off at just an alarming rate
707843 the dentists do not need the patients theyre busy enough with their regular paying clients
707844 but the patients need the dentists its an ongoing battle
707845 hasnt been anywhere close to what the costs of dentistry are
707846 we know there is a very real need but its a real rub if dentists even look at it as a way to break even
707847 the positive effect that increased funding has had is unfortunately maybe fewer dentists have dropped off
707848 but that doesnt put us in a position where we can go back to the capitol and say hey look what you did is great
707849 if its an optional program then the dentists never have any security
707850 in the last five or eight years they havent known whether its on or off
707851 really it takes more than one increase it has to be a legitimate ongoing program
707852 basic traditional dental equipment which allows us to take care of most of the needs of medicaid patients

707857 estos partidos siempre son as no tienen car cter amistoso porque hay mucho prestigio cada uno quiere hacer un buen papel ganando a un equipo importante por eso and bamos con mucho cuidado para no correr riesgo con los jugadores de la selecci n porque son partidos serios
707858 primero tenemos que volver a casa y recuperar los nimos luego veremos simplemente es una cosa de f tbol todos los grandes futbolistas han pasado por estas cosas el volver a ser el de siempre pero en este momento hay que mirar con tranquilidad que vamos a hacer

707876 it was a good game with a good intensity for pre season we were not in trouble defensively a lot and also created a lot of chances so it was very positive our shape was much better than yesterday our movement was better and overall we got what we want from this kind of game it was serious but as well we could take different initiatives in the last two days i have learned a lot about my squad and our preparation it was two great days
707877 he felt certainly that people questioned his commitment and the best answer is to give it all on the pitch play well show that you are ready to fight for your shirt fight for your team and to be efficient he showed that and he is a man of character you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly the frustration and you have to show things with performances in our job
707878 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa or not but i am not on this case i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players it is better i dont speak about names i said this yesterday and it is better i leave things to your imagination and creation
707879 i cannot tell you anything more if we sign a player we will come out and tell you but i can say to you now that we are not close to signing anybody
707880 you wouldnt want to put any limitations on his participation in the season because he is only 16 at that age you can improve he looked strong enough and not phased by the big games but the quality is there i dont look too much at his age more at what he is doing on the pitch and right now what he is doing is good
707881 he is ahead of where he was last year i hope theo is more regular in the team this year no 14 is a big number to inherit but i have confidence in theo of course but it is down to performances and i feel his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration and final ball is better there is goal scoring potential in him and hopefully one day we will get that out of him for now he is not a link player between the midfield and the strikers like robin van persie can be and he is maybe not at the moment a fraction short physically to play a real target man because you get bombarded in the air he can play wide right and wide left as well
707882 i think it was a good game between robinho and sagna he wasnt fazed by the physical challenge and if you want to know if i think robinho can adapt in the premier league he looks like he has the ingredients to do it i am not worried if he joins chelsea because at chelsea will always have 11 good players on the pitch no matter if it is robinho or somebody else they will always have the choice

707887 there are actions we can take to ease the pain of those hit hardest by food and fuel price rises well targeted income support can ease the burden of relative price changes on the poorest citizens support from donors and multilateral institutions including the imf which i head can ease the burden on the poorest countries
707888 the u s has been on the brink of recession for six months and the growth outlook is deteriorating in japan and more recently europe but there is a critical difference between todays stagflation risks and those of the 1970s which started in rich industrial countries policy mistakes and an insidious wage price spiral led most people to expect that inflation would keep rising which then became a self fulfilling prophecy now its no longer common in developed economies to index wages to inflation and wages are restrained by structural global competition and cyclical recessionary forces
707889 my vote is to attack inflation first foremost and decisively ultimately uncontrolled price increases will fall hardest on the poor and vulnerable and soaring prices will only create a situation in which the ultimate medicine will be even more painful than it would be today moreover it is crucial to head off inflation before the expectation of price increases becomes a self fulfilling prophecy for companies pricing their products and workers pushing for raises
707890 the reason sharply higher prices for oil and raw materials have changed the landscape for countries and global corporations making reductions in energy use economically viable and strategically important in a way that no amount of green activism ever could any company with a supply chain and global operations must either reduce its oil consumption and so its carbon footprint or rapidly see its profits eaten up by fuel bills

707897 big picture perspective our community really has changed a lot within the past five years i sense a great deal of stress within the police department citywide issues increasing violence involving girls he has looked at a lot of data with the district attorneys office girls are extremely angry angry parents are coming into the schools increasing issues in the neighborhood that end up in the schools mentioned south transfer point beating and that principal ed holmes mediated the situation at an early stage growing gang violence issue particularly in the east side schools we do have gang activity at memorial and west but most of the issues are at lafollete and east dealing with this via training and building relationships what the school are experiencing is a reflection of what is going on in the community

707941 theres no setback or anything like that the move gets an arm in the bullpen which is the most important thing
707942 we feel that the extra time is going to do him some good were taking the precaution of making sure that hes going to be fine
707943 heck yeah theres more fans and all that stuff but its still baseball youre still getting three outs ive still got to be out there on the mound and do my job
707944 hes playing shortstop in an important time for us and he seems pretty comfortable doing it
707945 hes kind of billy mueller ish which isnt so bad a switch hitter that swings at strikes hits the ball in the gap
707946 you dont know after 80 90 at bats what a kids going to be neither do i thats just impossible but hes really an interesting young hitter but how he finishes or where he gets to we wouldnt know theres no way
707947 i actually made a point of telling him youve heard me say it a million times when hitters reach out and drive the ball the other way theres a pretty good chance if you swing at strikes youre going to hit the ball hard the other way too you have to have balance you have to be on time or you dont get hits like that
707948 he just got out of the pool onto dry land
707949 hes actually doing great and hes probably ahead of schedule considering what happened but hes not doing wind sprints
707950 were working backwards from the first day he can come off and progressing toward that
707951 if he passes all the tests then thats what well shoot for if you start having setbacks then the day you work back from will start to move
707952 its really neat hes really enjoying watching his brother play and you could tell he would love being out there hes grinning ear to ear on the bench
707953 the pitches saturday night didnt have much finish on them
707954 and when you dont have finish its like throwing batting practice
707955 it was feeling better but then when i had to go back out there saturday night it got to the point where i couldnt finish the pitches i couldnt locate the ball inside because i just couldnt get out there its not doing us any good
707956 i think the catchers knee got him in his leg and then hunter came into his back a little bit
707957 in an emergency if i needed him he could bat but hes an older guy and youve kind of got to be careful with those guys
707958 hes a pinch hitter at best at this point in time and maybe an emergency guy
707959 i think hes shown improvement with his fastball command the last two times out best velocity of the season best command of the season
707960 coming off the bad outing in pittsburgh three runs four hits in one inning i thought he bounced back nicely he had a number of good outings before that
707961 with both of them fastball command is an issue a major issue
707962 secondary pitches commanding the strike zone is not good thats a bad combination when youre coming out of the bullpen
707963 if people dont start stepping it up you got to go in different directions
707964 whether its calling people up from triple a toledo or making other changes
707965 this is a good team we are playing but were a good team too were too good to be playing like this im ashamed to be playing like this but maybe im the one whos got us overrated but thats my situation
707966 this is not some kind of a threat i really like this team but you got to do better i cant keep putting them in the lineup or giving them the ball to pitch
707967 the last few weeks there were situations where we should have dominated the game and we didnt even come close
707968 im not talking about any one individual i am talking about all of us the managers the coaches the players you got to step up if you want to be in the hunt
707969 i write their name in the lineup the rest is up to them
707970 at some point you got to earn playing time you have to produce this is a game about production
707971 ive told the team a few times we got two teams ahead of us right now and i wouldnt take either one of them personnel wise
707972 you can either sit there as a player and say it just wasnt our year or you can say
707973 mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control
707974 remain available as an overflow facility while the old centre would be operational
707975 ive been swinging the bat a lot better since the all star break but i havent had a whole lot of luck
707976 im hitting the ball good but i dont have a lot to show for it
707977 hes had pitches to hit but hes just a tad off hell get pitches that he fouls back or pitches that he just misses hopefully as we keep moving here hell start to square some of those baseballs up and help us
707978 our goal is to hit the ball hard you cant control where it goes or what happens after it leaves the bat there has been a lot of games where i hit the ball good and had nothing to show for it and if you read the box scores or look at a batting average you wouldnt be able to tell
707979 i went from consistent playing time with the rangers to a fourth outfielder with the phillies
707980 i worked awfully hard to try to get away from the label that i was a fourth outfielder like i was with arizona i broke away from that when i was with texas hitting 29 home runs in 2005 and having two good offensive seasons in a row and then i get put right back into it with philadelphia
707981 i look at that trade as a step in the opposite direction at this point in my career its kind of hard to reverse those things when youre traded theres nothing you can do about it and you just take the role youre given
707982 its a lot easier to stay hot or swing well when youre in there on a consistent basis now im at the point where i try to make the most of each at bat each game that im in there you can only control what you can what you cant control you have to let go
707983 the guy works as hard as anybody cares as much as anybody and when hes not playing the way he feels like he needs to play he gets as upset as anybody
707984 i look at myself as a leader by example i think you can get your point across better by playing hard respecting each other respecting the game and doing the right things
707985 ive been on several playoff teams so im just here to help out wherever they need me
707986 we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another
707987 what john mccain has done in the last week has really shown the american people he doesnt want to talk about the economy or foreign policy or healthcare
707988 some people have to do better or theyll be some changes
707989 its not a threat or anything i dont want to and hope i dont have to but thats just the way it is
707990 whats going on right now is not good enough its been disappointing from day 1
707991 youve got to step it up if you want to be in the hunt
707992 you dont want to be in the hunt go home take an early vacation come back for spring training well bring some kids up to play
707993 we should be embarrassed im not sure enough people are
707994 ive been disgusted the last two nights going back to the hotel
707995 we just looked like we got out pitched out hustled out managed thats embarrassing this is a good team were playing but were pretty good too

708014 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
708015 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
708016 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
708017 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
708018 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
708019 a passport does nothing passports at this point in china is nothing they can do anything
708020 i dont believe you have to be a child psychologist or doctor to look at those particular girls and say wait a minute these are kids they are not 16 years old not a doubt in my mind

708023 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
708024 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
708025 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers

708030 el principal alimento del miedo es la ignorancia y seguramente los habitantes de las urbanizaciones de clase media alta evitan por temor aquellas zonas de la ciudad en las que nunca han puesto un pie
708031 se trata de un miedo clasista p nico de clase media l sabe que en realidad ese tipo de delitos esos sucesos violentos los sufren sobre todo las clases bajas los m s desprotegidos
708032 hoy no podemos alegar ya ignorancia la informaci n instant nea a trav s de la red y los canales televisivos de atentados terroristas bombardeos ciegos brutalidades y abusos de quienes se creen investidos de un destino manifiesto y nos arrastran a la espiral de violencia engendrada por su arrogancia penetran en nuestros hogares como un producto de consumo m s en el mismo paquete que las emisiones destinadas a embrutecer a n si cabe al p blico que zapea con el mando a distancia publicidad machacona que rebaja al ciudadano a una especie de yonqui y como se al william burroughs en vez de venderle la mercanc a a l lo vende a l a la mercanc a muerte en directo deg ello de rehenes transmitido en tiempo real planos de cad veres muy poco exquisitos ni os y madres destrozados por bombas desplome espectacular de rascacielos y de cuerpos lanzados al vac o todas las crueldades y cr menes de nuestros semejantes difundidos y trivializados
708033 los peligros pol ticos inherentes a la utilizaci n cotidiana de la televisi n resultan de que la imagen posee la particularidad de producir lo que los cr ticos llaman el efecto de realidad puede mostrar y hacer creer lo que muestra este poder de evocaci n es capaz de provocar fen menos de movilizaci n social

708048 in order to determine whether the reduction of some of the applicants debts to the bvs constitutes state aid it is appropriate in the present case to apply the test of a private creditor in a market economy which was referred to in the contested decision and which moreover was not challenged by the applicant by granting the price reduction the bvs did not act as a public investor acting in a manner comparable to that of a private investor pursuing a structural policy whether general or sectoral and guided by the longer term prospects of profitability of the capital invested that public body had in fact to be compared to a private creditor seeking to obtain payment of sums owed to it by a debtor in financial difficulties

708059 know how sublime a thing it is to suffer and be strong
708060 know how transcendent how divine how holy a thing it is to suffer and be strong
708061 but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may rest upon me for the sake of christ then i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for when i am weak then i am strong
708062 our tendency in the midst of suffering is to turn on god to get angry and bitter and shake our fist at the sky and say god you dont know what its like you dont understand you have no idea what im going through you dont have a clue how much this hurts the cross is gods way of taking away all of our accusations excuses and arguments the cross is god taking on flesh and blood and saying me too this can transform our experience of heartbreak instead of being something that distances us from god causing us to question where are you every poem by a lover spurned every song sung with an ache every movie with a gut wrenching scene every late night conversation and empty box of kleenex are glimpses into the life of god its the place we find out were not alone where we find strength to go on not a strength that comes from within ourselves but a strength that comes from god the god who keeps going who keeps offering who keeps loving who keeps risking a god who knows what its like our healing begins when we participate in the suffering of god when we dont avoid it but enter into it and in the process enter into the life of god when we see our pain not as separating us from but connecting us to our maker and in this connection theres always the chance well find a reason to risk again if god can continue to risk then maybe we can too perhaps you have had your heart broken by somebody you risked and extended and offered yourself and they rejected and turned away and didnt return your love there is something divine in your suffering somebody divine in your pain you know how god feels really good loving people get hurt its how things are maybe youre living in the wake of a relationship that fell apart you have to dig those moments up the parts that hurt and the awkward conversations and the anger and the failure and the misunderstanding and the betrayal you have to dig them up and acknowledge them before you are ever going to heal the danger is that you will decide it isnt worth it why risk if its going to hurt like this the tragedy would be for you to shut down to allow a wall to be built around your heart and for something within you to die a decision not to risk again is a decision not to love again they go together in matters of love its as if god has agreed to play by the same rules we do god can do what makes god god but god cant do everything god cant make us love our choice love is risky for god too

708272 we do recognize that unreasonably impeding the performance of an internet application like peer to peer file sharing and not just outright blocking a particular website or program violates the fccs internet policies we do require that internet providers inform their customers when they make important technical decisions that change how the internet works and we do give consumers who feel their internet experience is being unreasonably interfered with a right to seek help at the commission we do not however prohibit carriers from reasonably managing their networks and we do not prevent engineers either now or in the future from coming up with new and better ways to serve their customers
708273 this decision is seminal because for the first time we interpret the specific provisions of the internet policy statement and follow through on our repeated promises to act on allegations of misconduct at the same time it is also a narrow decision grounded firmly in the facts of the case before us
708274 rather than assuming the role of world wide web enforcer perhaps the best way for the fcc to fulfill our duties under internet policy statement would be to assume the role of mediator or arbitrator helping to facilitate agreements among the various sectors of the broadband internet industry to create an experience that benefits all users rather than issuing broad mandates to protect the few

708319 what can you say about the cre transaction slowdown this article points out
708320 the number of sales are definitely slowing down for a couple of reasons the credit markets are making it difficult to obtain financing many pending sales are taking 2 to 3 times longer to close as well lenders are being far more conservative in their underwriting which is resulting in lower ltvs the cost of capital is increasing as lenders increase their spreads and up front costs and this all results to higher costs for investors and therefore lower return on their investment
708321 so the costs are up and returns are down how does that affect the behavior of the sellers and buyers
708322 well that creates a spread between bid and ask price for commercial properties in this new environment sellers are asking too much for their properties and buyers are offering less than before many sellers are realizing they cant get the prices they might have 18 months ago and that now may not be a good time to sell and many of the buyers that were in the market 18 months ago are out the 1031 buyers for example so we are seeing less transactions taking place
708323 what do you see with regards to sales volumes looking forward
708324 i think the slowdown is temporary credit markets will come back to more normal conditions and it will gradually become easier to secure financing sellers will eventually come back down to earth over the the rest of this year and in to 2009 we will continue to see slower sales volumes than in the past in the meantime there will still be a small number of distressed sellers who have to sell and will do so at depressed prices a lot of the people we are seeing sell now are in trouble
708325 what tips would you give our students who are eager to buy
708326 be patient build your team keep your lead generators going and watch for bargain properties as they show up make sure you only offer what the property can justify based on current income and expect sellers to begin accepting your offers again soon as they get a better understanding of what their property is really worth today i cant tell you how long the slowdown will last no one can and in this market remember a few more very important things when it comes to getting your deal financed use conservative underwriting in your proformas dont expect any more than 75 ltv and write in an extra 30 days extension on your financing period because loans are just taking longer these days

708362 a volte bisogna rischiare delle incertezze per avere delle certezze
708363 restituisco alla vita quello che ricevo se ti avvicini con la spada rispondo di spada se vuoi piet prima mostrala tu
708364 sono il migliore in quello che faccio il problema di quando sei il migliore che c sempre qualcuno che si crede migliore di te
708365 but it seems as if you are showing disrespect for the contributions service and sacrifice of the american soldier
708366 i was going to say that our soldiers were doing an extraordinary job
708367 the line of course is that politics makes strange bedfellows
708368 i think everyone needs to relax a little bit its a bit of humor
708369 they are trying to scare americans by engaging in character assassination
708370 i need to speak personally about mccain raising the question of whether obama is a risky guy it has nothing to do with his name or skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment with his unreadiness sic to be president he made a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain this man doesnt have a bigoted bone in his body it was just wrong for senator obama to have done that and it was right for the campaign to call him out in it
708371 i was just messing with my camera from my standpoint it was meant to be harmless these women were just subjects to me
708372 id have been upset to know that those people felt uncomfortable about it but i can hand on heart say i would never do any of this again im a very different man now i am not a danger to women and i never killed
708373 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
708374 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
708375 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
708376 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
708377 cuando veas que el camino es muy largo y creas no tener m s fuerzas te aconsejo mirar lo recorrido y recordar la energ a que pusiste
708378 me acord de ti pero no tuve tiempo para llamarte
708379 no confiar hasta q te demuestren q si puedes hacerlo
708380 matem ticamente hablando la realidad actual se conforma por una serie de puntos vectoriales que conforman una
708381 ohhh pero que simp tico que es que linda personalidad tiene
708382 this is what i will give you for a smile
708383 well ya give me something to hold and its going in my mouth
708384 like i said above something to hold therefore in the mouth
708385 im done with these pictures i want to to take a nap
708386 si yo hablo en lenguas de hombres y de ngeles pero no tengo amor no soy mas que un tambor que resuena o un platillo que hace ruido si comunico mensajes recibidos de dios y conozco todas las cosas secretas y tengo toda clase de conocimientos y tengo toda la fe necesaria para quitar los cerros de su lugar pero no tengo amor no soy nada si reparto todo lo que tengo y si entrego hasta mi propio cuerpo para ser quemado pero no tengo amor de nada me sirve el que tiene amor tiene paciencia es bondadoso y no envidioso no es presumido ni orgulloso no es grosero ni ego sta no se enoja ni es rencoroso no se alegra del pecado del otro sino de la verdad todo lo soporta con confianza esperanza y paciencia el amor nunca muere vendr el tiempo en que ya no se tendr que comunicar mensajes recibidos ni se necesitara el conocimiento pues conocemos solamente en parte y en parte comunicamos el mensaje divino pero cuando conozcamos en forma completa lo que es en parte desaparecer cuando yo era ni o hablaba pensaba y razonaba como ni o pero cuando ya fui un hombre deje atr s las cosas de ni os de la misma manera ahora vemos las cosas en una forma confusa como reflejos borrosos en un espejo pero entonces las veremos con toda claridad ahora solamente conozco en parte pero entonces voy a conocer completamente como dios me conoce a mi asi pues la fe la esperanza y el amor duran para siempre pero el mayor de estos tres es el amor
708387 ber einen kleinen zuschuss f r die sommerwochen w rde ich mich freuen
708388 kenny vs spenny a great favourite of mine the competitor kenneth hotz a jew is accused of
708389 my friend jesus said with a hispanic accent is getting married and i want to play a joke on him
708390 weve got the best fans in the league it was like a morgue here until the end
708391 well done to all of us the team appreciates this while they play for us in that red shirt well be backing them
708392 i cant believe that many people came up from wollongong to support their team and please print this they were outstanding
708393 the atmosphere was fantastic and if we can get a crowd like that to our home games it would be very special
708394 theyve brought up four bus loads of supporters and taken over our grandstand
708395 it was lucky because it narrowly missed the bedroom window where my two young sons sleep
708396 we were in darkness at this stage because of the blackout so we tried to secure the remaining parts of the roof while we waited for the ses to arrive
708397 we have been here 19 years and never experienced winds like this the fact they lifted a roof the size of two rooms shows just how strong they were
708398 it was so lucky that it happened in the dead of night because otherwise andrews kids may have been playing in the backyard as they often do
708399 we just about worked around the clock from friday night and we are at it again today to finish the clearing up
708400 most of the jobs in our area from helensburgh to the shellharbour boundary involved fallen trees and roof damage
708401 we had to rush to a few caravans at windang because they had been loosened from their footings
708402 we got more call outs this time probably because the earlier winds had weakened trees and roofs
708403 stuart set a world record last year but this year the coal was a little bit damp
708404 the sound echoing throughout the village kept people entertained all day
708405 weeding out a few people here and there will do nothing to get to the root of the problem
708406 the labor party has committed itself to the top end of town in a number of ways and with development in particular
708407 it has been going on for years getting in the way of proper urban planning and infrastructure decisions
708408 when you start joining the dots there is a very strong argument for a royal commission
708409 at the moment there is a perception that politicians are above accountability
708410 but that does not explain away the ethics of the situation it does not excuse ms hays alleged behaviour
708411 it is like a festering sore with far too many unanswered questions
708412 the whole thing needs to be broadened so that we dont have bodies like icac saying no we cant go there
708413 i know an inquiry needs to go much deeper than these claims against noreen hay
708414 my phone has been running hot with people wanting to know what is going on
708415 we get it from all fronts the anti smoking lobby the government and its laws and from black marketeers who sell cheap cigarettes that can put people in hospital
708416 what are we supposed to do operate from behind a curtain
708417 it is either legal or not the government wants it both ways they say they want to stop people smoking but they still want the taxes
708418 the law that has had the most impact so far was banning smoking inside cafes clubs and pubs
708419 it is the issue of having to leave a venue to smoke which makes a lot of my customers feel like lepers
708420 what people are doing is turning to backyard suppliers who sell for probably a fifth of what i can sell for but they dont realise the risk they are taking
708421 i had one woman come back to me when the black market cigarette she bought put her in hospital
708422 plenty of them say they end up hooked on the nicotine patches and find it cheaper to go back to smoking
708423 hey buddy need a couple of hundred thou for a house
708424 i served for two years on the freddie mac loan prospector advisory committee
708425 they claimed it was so they could hear from bankers and brokers about what they could do with not only their automated underwriting decision but how freddie could improve
708426 we as a group came up with many ideas yet the real reason we met in places like new orleans and the ritz in suburban washington was to promote their agenda
708427 they sent an armada of their people to the meetings and never really considered what we had to say
708428 during the peak of the bubble frenzy people would always ask me just how bad it could get
708429 i always said that some major bank failures and either bankruptcies or takeovers of some large home builders to possibly be followed by a federal bailout of the gses government sponsored enterprises would be the worst case scenario that scenario has now arrived
708430 if joe and jane taxpayer are going to be asked to bail them out during their time of peril they should also be able to participate and be rewarded in their future recovery
708431 what is going on is that a realistic view of the role of regulation has finally sunk in at the federal reserve the subprime problem was not unknown there but the attitude was that the markets could handle it
708432 well they cant so we will likely see a lot more regulatory activity in the housing and financial markets
708433 i am currently involved with one specific deal where the appraiser has insisted on making three return trips to the condo being financed and is still contending that minor touch up paint and tile work be completed before he gives the ok for the bank to release or sign off on the loan
708434 agents and sellers previously insulated from the changing financial landscape
708435 are starting to get the idea that this crisis is in fact going to affect them
708436 it is as clear as daylight that gareth wants to go and liverpool now have as long as they like to find the money liverpool will obviously get their wish and gareth will get his wish at some stage or another
708437 there is no point going on any further the chairman randy lerner and myself are disappointed but thats the way it is it is up to liverpool and gareth and his agent the ball is firmly in liverpools court
708438 liverpool made their intentions clear to sign gareth almost four months ago and they have known for some time what the price would be
708439 they have been able to find money for another player who wasnt in the equation certainly four months ago and two months ago i have agreed with gareth now thats it no problem liverpool have all the time in the world to do it if they want to raise the money
708440 i love the premier league and i would certainly like to play there
708441 however if i go to england i would want to play for arsenal or chelsea
708442 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
708443 the rhythm of life runs in cycles there are times in the darkness and times in the light the energy of life is like the rain forest in borneo things live grow die fall to the forest floor rot and then they are born again remember what mother says
708444 im exhausted constantly hungry and if everything goes to plan im going to be a mother in 7 months
708445 there you have it the day after the dreaded day
708446 how to ditch your husband after age 35 using what i learned at harvard business school
708447 should singles and the scholars who study them make their mark or stay in their place
708448 well it is not that i want to be single
708449 i just havent found the one have had some rough years and am taking time to myself
708450 i become something else to them as though i have no mind of my own without a man
708451 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
708452 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
708453 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
708454 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
708455 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
708456 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
708457 we apologize to our prophet muhammad but we say to him oh prophet of allah do not be saddened your nation will be victorious
708458 we say to this west which does not act reasonably and does not learn its lessons by allah you will be defeated
708459 dont you see that every act of deceit they contrive is being turned against them by allah
708460 dont you see that they believe they are capable of using democracy to deceive the people but then democracy is turned against them
708461 they do not understand the arab or muslim mentality which rejects the foreigner
708462 i bring good tidings to our beloved prophet muhammad allahs promise and the prophets prophecy of our victory in palestine over the jews and over the oppressive zionists has begun to come true
708463 i say to the european countries hurry up and apologize to our nation because if you do not you will regret it
708464 tomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world
708465 the western countries must stop the fools are these reasonable people they allow offenses against allah and the prophets they are offending not only muhammad but all the prophets but when an historian among them talks about the holocaust it is the sin of all sins if anybody criticizes the jews this constitutes anti semitism by law they hold their own people accountable for that the west which waved the slogans of liberty after the french revolution three centuries ago does not respect its own principles or slogans today it violates them
708466 this victory which was clearly evident in the elections conveys a message to israel to america and to all the oppressors around the world you have no way of overcoming us
708467 there is a chasm between you and our defeat you will be the ones to be defeated allah willing the time of defeat is gone and the day of victory has come allah willing wherever you turn you will fail
708468 allah willing we will make them lose their eyesight we will make them lose their brains
708469 israel has begun to sense that its superiority has come to an end
708470 the arabs have said we dont want conventional wars thank you very much
708471 if you fight them they will turn their backs on you and will not be victorious
708472 that is why allah akbar allah is greater we say that every day allah akbar yes allah is greater than america allah is greater than the oppressors allah is greater than the superpowers allah is greater than the tyranny of the oppressing world and allah is greater than israel since allah is greater and he supports us we will be victorious
708473 i know that all arab leaders want palestine to be liberated
708474 if prior to the hamas victory there were several military wings each with a few hundred or a few thousand fighters under the rule of hamas if you continue to besiege us to starve our people to ignore our rights and if you continue your occupation your aggression and your assassinations we the hamas will declare a general call to arms we will place the entire palestinian people at the disposal of the resistance and its weapons
708475 allah akbar allah be praised allah akbar allah be praised allah akbar allah be praised allah akbar allah be praised allah akbar allah be praised allah akbar allah be praised
708476 be careful not to drive our people into a corner occupation aggression assassinations 9 000 male and female prisoners preventing aid imposing a siege causing starvation and on top of all this you dont want to recognize democracy and its results
708477 hamas has a vision hamas can manage the political battle just like it managed the military battle
708478 the german chancellor angela merkel pops up and says democracy and success in the elections are not sufficient for hamas to gain legitimacy
708479 brothers and sister there is confusion in the western world and in the american administration
708480 nevertheless we want to deal with politics but there is a difference between the politics of the weak and defeatists which we will constantly repeat the kind of politics that does not impress the enemy and so it does nothing because like in the marketplace products praised too much become cheap if we continue to praise our products constantly saying we love peace we have given up the option of war peace is our strategic option for gods sake israel give us a few scraps of land by allah we will be degraded in the eyes of our enemies
708481 we will conduct our politics in the language of victory
708482 the people has given us a deposit and has empowered us to liberate its land to restore jerusalem and its holy places it has empowered us to release 9 000 male and female prisoners it has empowered us to stop the aggression to liberate the land and to restore its rights the people has empowered us to bring back 5 5 million palestinian refugees and displaced people to their homeland after all this hamas in order to please america and the european union and in order for the pressure on us to stop and in order for their highnesses to allow us to establish a government we are not trying to please them
708483 it is in your interests to change your relations and policies regarding the arab and islamic nation and the palestinian cause
708484 i say to america europe and the west it is in your interests to change your relations and policies regarding the arab and islamic nation and the palestinian cause
708485 israel will be defeated and will be of no use to you the arabs will be victorious the muslims will be victorious palestine will be victorious change your policy soon if you want to protect your interests and maintain healthy relations with the east
708486 he is the kind of player they have not seen in english football yet the fans have seen great dribblers and fabulous strikers from spain portugal argentina and brazil
708487 but they have never seen a player from russia with such exceptional talent
708488 without arshavin we would not have got there he was an absolute star in every european round
708489 he also was the most influential player in the league and helped us win the title for every team hes the extra quality you need to win trophies
708490 a good agent worries about the players profile if a player is squeaky clean and well liked he can make allot of money in endorsements if on the other hand he is seen as greedy and selfish few companies will want to link there products with him
708491 it got a bit too far maybe it is such an issue at the moment in spain it gets a bit over the top
708492 a couple of our players they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars and everybody waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete
708493 son on the inside of every person a battle is raging between two wolves
708494 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
708495 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
708496 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
708497 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
708498 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
708499 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
708500 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
708501 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
708502 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
708503 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
708504 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
708505 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
708506 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
708507 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
708508 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
708509 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
708510 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
708511 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
708512 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
708513 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
708514 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
708515 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
708516 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
708517 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
708518 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
708519 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
708520 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
708521 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
708522 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
708523 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
708524 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
708525 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
708526 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
708527 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
708528 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
708529 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
708530 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
708531 the motivating factors behind making india the great bpo ites destination include strong quality orientation among players ability to offer round the clock services based on the countrys unique geographic location positive policy environment which encourages investments and a friendly tax structure which places the ites bpo industry on almost equal footing with it services companies
708532 professional hitman jill dando is another sophie look alike with blond hair and blue eyes and jill dando was a friend of sophie the illuminati obsession with ritual leaves me in no doubt that dandos death was connected to the sequence detailed here by arizona wilder
708533 barack obama is a muslim can you hear his name he wants to destroy america
708534 death is not an event in life we do not live to experience death
708535 we never said that evms had been actually tampered with
708536 we merely pointed out that there is a theoretical possibility that this could be done
708537 lawdy miss clawdy baby what you want me to do
708538 he had his hands in a lot of different things
708539 he was involved with projects that were approved at the highest levels
708540 if i were thailand id be asking what about us
708541 our foreign policy has been robust in the far east
708542 not many presidents could say in the history of u s diplomacy that relations with south korea japan china and thailand are strong and robust a lot of times if youre friends with one you made it hard to be friends with another
708543 there is some worry especially among the japanese that the u s is going to be too focused on china
708544 there is still something to the critique that they were overly focused on the middle east
708545 i promise to love you forever every single day of forever
708546 mohammed picks his nose constantly and is a disruption in my class
708547 som i likhet med m nga av personerna i boken led under kulturrevolutionen eftersom m nga ans gs vara politiskt svarta
708548 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
708549 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
708550 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
708551 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
708552 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
708553 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
708554 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
708555 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
708556 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
708557 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
708558 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
708559 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
708560 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
708561 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
708562 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
708563 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
708564 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
708565 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
708566 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
708567 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
708568 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
708569 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
708570 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
708571 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
708572 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
708573 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
708574 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
708575 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
708576 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
708577 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
708578 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
708579 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
708580 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
708581 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
708582 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
708583 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
708584 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
708585 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
708586 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
708587 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
708588 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
708589 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
708590 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
708591 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
708592 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
708593 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
708594 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
708595 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
708596 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
708597 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
708598 so why isnt obamas camp and the democrats offering a more spirited defense is the party too smug or cocky or decent to roll up its sleeves and fight fire with fire
708599 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
708600 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
708601 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
708602 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
708603 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life

708611 kenwynes going in tomorrow for an operation and we will know in 24 hours of the exact damage so fingers crossed

708613 kieran just had a stiff back the last couple of days
708614 there was no point risking him today id be very surprised if he wasnt on the flight to ireland with us on wednesday
708615 the last few days we all had to switch off
708616 we had this game coming up and sometimes have to prioritise focus on that but im sure tomorrow well be back on that roundabout with speculation of whos going where
708617 ive said for the last week or two were hopeful of two or three players coming on board
708618 we have two or three weeks to play with but dont want to get backed into a corner at the end of august
708619 i was generally pleased with the game today but we probably need three players
708620 even at the end of last season i thought we needed another top striker at the football club

708625 estos partidos siempre son as no tienen car cter amistoso porque hay mucho prestigio cada uno quiere hacer un buen papel ganando a un equipo importante por eso and bamos con mucho cuidado para no correr riesgo con los jugadores de la selecci n porque son partidos serios
708626 primero tenemos que volver a casa y recuperar los nimos luego veremos simplemente es una cosa de f tbol todos los grandes futbolistas han pasado por estas cosas el volver a ser el de siempre pero en este momento hay que mirar con tranquilidad que vamos a hacer
708627 es una lastima porque es un gran torneo y piensa que como el a o pasado en mosc hay que parar un d a entre las dos jornadas el peligro es alt simo al jugar dos partidos con tanta intensidad con grandes equipos

708630 taking the hosts apart bit there maybe we can do just that
708631 i seem to repeat myself every year but the problem at this football club has always been getting a team to match the supporters
708632 its a massive challenge for anybody to do that and its my challenge to do that at the moment
708633 thats what i will try to do and im doing my very best to do exactly that
708634 hertha berlin were a different type of opposition for us and that was a good test and that will be the same against real mallorca tonight
708635 the main thing for us is to get time on the pitch and get the new players integrated and from that point of view it has been very useful
708636 being away from home has been very good for us too
708637 to come out as a group and be together like this is good
708638 the morale in the squad is much better than when i first came in
708639 but it can build up even more as players get into condition for the new season
708640 the players were tired on friday night because its been so hot over here as you would expect at this time of year
708641 with the game being later on sunday that will help us too and the players will step their game up because its against the host club real mallorca
708642 you cannot really judge anybody on pre season results though
708643 they are nice to get but results are only part of pre season until the season starts for real

708730 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
708731 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
708732 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
708733 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country

708737 im pretty disturbed that this is an incident that has been going on for five months and hawaii gets informed a week ago and we just got informed
708738 when i was guam homeland security advisor i was told that we would be informed as soon as an incident occurs what happened
708739 they notified hawaii last week they notify us the same day as japan where does that put us whats our status
708740 are we a foreign government or are we a part of the united states
708741 even though the amount was minimal i think the people of guam have a high sensitivity to anything nuclear and other things that might have a negative effect to the people of guam
708742 even though the military has said that its a very low amount any leak is a cause for concern
708743 its probably going to happen more theyre probably going to try to cover it more because they want to stay on this island

708767 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
708768 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
708769 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
708770 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
708771 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
708772 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
708773 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
708774 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations

708776 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

708778 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
708779 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
708780 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
708781 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

708783 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
708784 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
708785 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
708786 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
708787 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
708788 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
708789 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
708790 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
708791 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
708792 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
708793 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
708794 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
708795 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
708796 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
708797 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
708798 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
708799 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
708800 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
708801 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
708802 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
708803 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
708804 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
708805 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
708806 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

708866 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
708867 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
708868 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

708872 were just starting to talk about it but i think well do it this season
708873 an episode where the boys investigate a haunting at one of the high schools they used to go to and then flashback to what the boys high school lives were like well sort of see them played by 18 year olds and giving people swirlies or whatever the hell they did i dont know yet we havent worked it out
708874 were not really going to see hell except in quick flashes and those types of moments
708875 there isnt going to be like fade in hell dean being poked with a pitchfork its going to be more about his return to earth and what that does to you psychologically hes still dean but deep in his soul hes been in the worst pow camp ever
708876 the boys have never been able to keep secrets from each other before not since season one when they were separate so to have a period of time where they were separate and they can surprise each other again has been really refreshing and fun to write
708877 i think sam and dean are both more individual or at least more heady
708878 theyve both done things in the last four months that theyre kind of worried about i think as we get into the meat of the season between episodes eight and fifteen were really going to delve into what sam did for those four months while dean was gone and the pain that hes gone through his brother was dead he buried his brother and then had to deal with it for a couple months and deal with it however you know he probably did some things he wasnt necessarily sure about and proud of hes definitely more hard edged
708879 for the first time theres a lot of story mythology centered around dean
708880 a lot of it was about sam and being psychic and whatever and now theres mysteries about each of them
708881 i always figured dean would come back otherwise its the sam winchester show
708882 i didnt know how and i didnt know why i always figured it would be that they find a way to get me out and that i would go back to just being dean and trying to save sam from whatever the demons had in store for him but now that ive come back and i cant figure out why or how its really starting to play into the psyche of dean and what hes going to go through and how thats going to involve himself into the mythology of not just sam but the entire show
708883 ill be the first to say when certain episodes or certain seasons suck but im really excited about this one
708884 were giggling like schoolgirls in the writers room we think were on to something this year i think we have some really really cool stuff in store

708941 however in order to pre empt opec they need to gain geo strategic control of iraq along with its 2nd largest proven oil reserves the second coalescing factor that is driving the iraq war is the quiet acknowledgement by respected oil geologists and possibly this administration is the impending phenomenon known as global peak oil this is projected to occur around 2010 with iraq and saudi arabia being the final two nations to reach peak oil production

708992 i had every ambition to lead the england team to the next ashes series but as england captain i feel ive run out of steam
708993 i believe that the best thing for the team is to embark on a new direction under a new captain
708994 i also believe the best thing for me is to try and get back to being best batsmen i can be ill still have all the experience and knowledge to pass on and i hope to be a valuable player for both my county and the england team

708999 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level
709000 and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult

709064 we have managed to put hunger on the agenda of government and make it a priority
709065 during the reporting period iof conducted at least 23 military incursions into palestinian communities in the west bank and arrested 48 palestinian civilians to date the
709066 at approximately 16 00 iof troops opened fire at houses in the area as a result tamer mohammed abu shaar aged 11 was killed by a gunshot to the head while he and his family attempted to escape from their house due to the intense iof gunfire
709067 we asked for revisions and it was edited every article in the new york times gets edited
709068 we dont use the op ed page for people to respond directly to articles in the paper or other op eds thats what letters to the editor are for
709069 the mccain campaign was aware of that before they sent in their draft
709070 it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obamas piece
709071 would have to articulate in concrete terms how senator mccain defines victory in iraq it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory with troop levels timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate and it would need to describe the senators afghanistan strategy spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan

709074 we have made our position abundantly clear to the israelis and indeed to the world not just in our public statements but in our private conversations as well
709075 there is uniformity across the u s government about the way to proceed with iran
709076 everyone from this white house including the vice presidents office is in agreement that the military option is not the best option at this point and we should pursue diplomatic and economic pressures
709077 an american commitment to deterrence especially if seen by israelis as a substitute for prevention is itself likely to spur israel to consider independent action

709080 some stupid psychologists have since stated to the media that lgbti people were more evil and immoral than heterosexual people
709081 so it has became a national issue and the police department and some radical islamic groups have been sweeping some gay areas in jakarta the police have already detained some gay persons in central jakarta
709082 that homosexuals commit sadistic killings should not surprise anybody if you know their world people with deviant sexual behavior are used to be close to criminal world they are used to make threats and to use force if someone who is invited to intimacy refuses the offer with such habits they can commit more serious crimes of course
709083 homosexuals have stronger feelings of jealousy and they can act quite violently when their wishes are not granted gays homosexuals have a deviant sexual behavior and their aggressiveness is therefore beyond normal
709084 there are a lot of heterosexual persons who also become murderers
709085 its not true the gay and lesbian persons are more possesive than heterosexual persons anyone could become a murderer it has nothing to do with sexual orientation
709086 my friend was arrested in senen area jakarta during a police razzia raid the reason was not clear i am now afraid to be kicked out from my apartment since the ryan affair started all gays have become afraid
709087 not discount that it will conduct raids against hangout places of homosexuals
709088 homosexuality is like an infectious disease that is why the local government should be tough with the usual gay hangout places if they are left free they will ultimately infect the larger population
709089 gays and lesbians will 100 sure go to hell because same sex relationships are forbidden by the koran
709090 we in arus pelangi are now preparing for possible attacks from fundamentalist islamic groups including evacuation
709091 we are preparing an urgent appeal for solidarity from international friends urging them to write letters of concern to the indonesian embassies and consulates in their countries
709092 since indonesia ratified the international covenant on civil and politic rights in 2005 many human rights violations continue to take place including arrests of gays simply because of their sexual orientation it is not right and the state has no right to arrest lgbti people for their sexual orientation it also has no right to legalise violence done by some fundamentalist islamic groups against lgbti people

709098 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing

709104 gaza is a prison and israel seems to have thrown away the key
709105 demands that the occupying power israel lift immediately the siege it has imposed on the occupied gaza strip restore continued supply of fuel food and medicine and reopen the border crossings the council calls for immediate protection of the palestinian civilians in the occupied palestinian territory in compliance with human rights law and international humanitarian law and urges all concerned parties to respect the rules of human rights law and international humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against the civilian population
709106 thanks to god it wasnt but this is so sad it must be terrible for their families with children left behind and no one now to support them
709107 its unacceptable that people in sderot are living in fear every day and people in the gaza strip are living life as usual
709108 the targeting of a government office near a wedding party venue with what must have been foreseen loss of life and injury to many civilians and the closure of all crossings into gaza raise very serious questions about israels respect for international law and its commitment to the peace process
709109 gaza is completely shut down this can only lead to the deterioration of an already dire situation
709110 punishing gazas 1 5 million civilians does not stop the rocket fire it only creates an impossible balance of human suffering on both sides of the border
709111 this kind of action against the people in gaza cannot be justified even by those rocket attacks
709112 also violates one of the basic principles of international humanitarian law that military action must distinguish between military targets and civilian targets

709137 because it looked so similar to the spike that we had just before the right front wheel failed on spirit back on sol 779 we were very concerned
709138 these wheels have around 24 25 million revolutions on them and their design requirement was 2 5 million so were a factor of 10 beyond the requirement
709139 weve always been concerned that if we lost an actuator inside the crater we would never be able to get out the slopes are just too steep for us to climb out at the same time were trying to drag one of the wheels like we do with spirit
709140 we want to get out of the crater as quickly as possible
709141 its going to be as direct a route as we think we can achieve but we still have to deal with the slope were in
709142 were not backing down so out of the crater is up from where we are right now
709143 but there was no recurrence of a high current spike on the left front drive actuator
709144 we have been able to maintain a stable battery state of charge the heaters for the batteries and the mini tes miniature thermal emission spectrometer have been enabled the entire season and now the sun is starting to move south again
709145 spirit has been active though at a low level in that we have had limited science operations each week
709146 we will increase the science as the power levels rise but itll probably be in this posture until the sun starts getting closer to being overhead
709147 we were hoping for conditions like this and its worked out that way
709148 there have been instances during the previous winters where weve had little up spikes in the tau or amount of dust in the atmosphere or other changes in the general atmosphere or environmental condition around the vehicles in wintertime this season has been unusual in the sense there hasnt been any of those and ive generally thought of us as being fortunate that the weather has held as well as it has
709149 these rovers are about 100 years in rover years but who knows
709150 maybe theyll live to 200 the fact that theyre still making such significant discoveries deep into their missions sort of says dont give up on these missions when theyre halfway through
709151 we got to the right tilt angle for the vehicle so we can maximize the energy production
709152 we rode out the winter solstice with power levels around 225 watt hours and the rover was able to maintain that level throughout july
709153 no worse than about 80 85 watt hours or so
709154 we have gone to a twice weekly planning cycle on monday and fridays we have our planning days for the rover
709155 we are doing 3 sol and 4 sol plans for spirit minimizing communications sessions to save as much energy as possible the uhf downlinks are every 4 days and the x band uplinks are 3 and 4 days so the two will fall out of phase with each other
709156 weve gotten about half of the bonestell pan finished so we still have quite a bit to do
709157 but the part that has been mostly completed is the portion of view in front of the vehicle basically looking at home plate and it does look spectacular
709158 our estimation process is to take one of these carrier signals which is our beep which corresponds to a time on the spacecraft that we can measure from the spacecrafts event logs
709159 we can then do a rough correlation of the difference between the earth time there and the earth time we can calculate from the onboard clock looking at that difference basically gives us a correction time for the amount of drift that clock has seen over time
709160 we got part of the signal but we didnt get all of it at the end so we couldnt do a good time estimate based on the receipt of the signal
709161 these beeps are a mechanism for doing something in between and were just going to continue to try periodically
709162 30 40 seconds of drift between the reference time here on earth and the reference time we can calculate on the vehicle
709163 wed like to take that time out though because if theres ever an instance where were trying to do real time operations with the vehicle then weve got to know when to send commands when those commands will be received and when well get back a signal from the vehicle
709164 that 30 40 seconds can have a significant impact especially when were trying to time a series of events to take place over the course of just 30 40 minutes
709165 our real time windows are not open for much longer than that now and if were trying to send a signal counting for one way light time thats more than 10 minutes now and were trying to get a few things done within that period those 30 40 seconds can really add up in the past what weve seen is when we dont quite get the timing right when we send commands at a time when the vehicle isnt listening or we send it early and the vehicle hasnt started in the communication window then all those sequences tends to get fouled up
709166 a lot of what we do with the engineering is anticipatory we try to plan as though were going to have a problem and we try to set the stage so we can recover from those problems
709167 doing regular maintenance to make sure that we can respond and respond correctly when we have to is part of our general agenda with respect to both vehicles in spirits case we just havent had the chance to be able to do this kind of correction on the clock
709168 but as the power increases we will add in more science activities
709169 the question will be whether we move before or after solar conjunction a two week period that begins in late november
709170 remember it was in this area where we found the high silica the expectation is that there is more rich silica to be found and the route to goddard and von braun will take us through some of these low lying areas between ridges where we think the silica would have accumulated so we have a lot of excitement in store for us with spirit as soon as we start driving again with her
709171 we have a vehicle that maybe is 120 meters away from some new geological formations there and if it had another 100 watt hours of energy we could start driving over there
709172 the whole point of being at cape verde and doing high resolution and super resolution imaging is that this was our first chance to get close up to one of these capes or promontories to better understand these rocks that weve been seeing from a distance since september 2006 with images that give us information about texture and what the individual layers are
709173 the rocks themselves are telling us they are hardened sinuous crusted dunes
709174 what surprised us was how complementary the capes were when we went from one to another we realized we were looking at different parts of the same overall feature what we see at cape verde is the same as what we see at cape st vincent and cape st mary crossbedding indicative of a dune field you look at one cape and you see what youd expect to see if you sliced into the dunes at that angle then go to another one and at that angle you see exactly what youd expect so youre looking at this regional dune field thats expressing itself in glorious detail on mars by getting up close we knew we could start distinguishing the textures and how exactly the sand was falling to create the layers
709175 for the first time were doing things that would normally be done by a field geologist on earth only were doing it on mars and at the same level of detail that a field geologist on earth would in other words were doing the same kind of analysis you would do if you were out in the field at meteor crater arizona but were doing it on mars with a robotic field geologist
709176 because of the accuracy and level of detail that were able to see in these images we are now also able to build models that show the paleo environment and what was going on theres a wondrous story at cape verde with a lot of science were still working on
709177 its pretty clear that that bright band is an alteration of the rocks and not part of the depositional rock record
709178 most likely the band was there before the impact that created the crater but it may not have been we can say that band was put in place after the rocks were in place so that band is the youngest thing at cape verde
709179 just this past month we finally found the bottom of that dune unit at cape verde and we did that from high res and super res imagery
709180 weve seen the base of the unit were talking about
709181 it might be either be a completely different dune field below it or it could be that the dune field were looking at was part of a very very large dune field you can have dunes running on the back of other dunes so it can either something like a 10 to 30 foot dune riding on back of a 100 foot dune field or its another dune field from another time it could be either answer
709182 the two encoders that we have lost are actually on traces on the outside portion of the ribbon cable which leads from the electronics down over the arm to where the rat is located on the arm
709183 we think were seeing a slow delamination or degradation of that ribbon cable and unfortunately the next traces in that cable ribbon are the encoder for the z actuator of the rat
709184 what we were doing is preparation for when we encounter that problem
709185 but after careful measurement and evaluation we felt we could drive there do this work then drive away
709186 we were on a 20 degree slope covered with a lot of loose material and the rover was struggling just to make headway
709187 we changed tact a couple of times trying to get to nevada
709188 that makes it awkward to drive because its a risk to arm and it means you have to be more careful
709189 every one of these drives was intended to get us to this sort of staging area for the run to this nevada region but climbing up these hills has been very difficult
709190 weve been negotiating anywhere from 10 to 15 degree slopes for quite some time but weve gotten stuck in a little dirt pits in the past so we have been trying to stay on rock paths rather than driving through the dirt
709191 even then were not always clear if the rocks are actually outcrop rocks or so lightly positioned in the soil they will move if you drive on top of them while the path we took seemed to have more rock than sand the vehicle was still slipping significantly as it was trying to get up the slope
709192 they then could turn and position themselves at this sort of staging area
709193 thats what all these little drives were they were each a few centimeters total but the drives were all stopped because of high slip
709194 to remind you when the wheel failed on spirit a few sols before it failed there was a current spike then we had the wheel failure
709195 then we did a motion test of the left front wheel where we rotated it back 45 degrees and then rotated it forward 90 degrees keeping all the other 5 wheels fixed
709196 that behaved normally the current levels were well behaved and the voltages were well behaved and the rate on the motor forward and backward so the wheel looks fine but we dont know if this current spike was a wake up call
709197 weve been very sensitive to high current spikes on actuators ever since we lost the actuator on spirits right front wheel on spirit basically we were driving along pretty much with nominal current suddenly had this high spike then no performance on the motor ever since that thankfully hasnt been the case on the left front actuator on opportunity
709198 the left front wheel on opportunity has the most revolutions of any of the wheels its 25 3 million versus 24 3 million
709199 they decided that the science we would do out on the plains in meridiani is the most important science to do so getting out of the crater is the priority
709200 where we came in duck bay is where were targeting to go out that is the shallowest slope
709201 just to check out the wheel in terms of normal driving with all the wheels operating
709202 we are on a path now to leave victoria the rover drivers have been looking at victoria and how to get out and so were going to start along that path but its going to be as direct a route as we think we can achieve but we still have to deal with the slope were in were not backing down so out of the crater is up from where we are right now
709203 this is even with a southerly tilt of the vehicle so everything is good in terms of energy
709204 small reductions in the dust coating over the last 2 months
709205 were going to drive again across the plains of meridiani and conduct this cobble campaign looking at these exposed rocks lying on the surface that tell us about different places on mars
709206 then were going to head toward another interesting feature like another crater theres a candidate crater not yet named about 2 kilometers to the north northwest from our current location
709207 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pay obeisance at the hilltop shrine

709216 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
709217 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
709218 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
709219 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

709233 its nice and peaceful and its sunny what are you doing up here uh
709234 loillola we met at the launch and at mess yesterday were doing the cable inspection today
709235 jok and i he started at the stern and i started at the bow
709236 ha is that a joke did you just make a joke
709237 well its just that sometimes people use the ship names for things and sometimes they dont
709238 some of us come from a naval background and some of us dont why wont you look at me
709239 its just that youre topless i dont like to stare at people when theyre naked
709240 i have a harness on and i dont care you can stare if you like
709241 youre from braemond arent you theyre a little more backward there as i recall
709242 when its really hot cause its really hot up here inside the float
709243 yeah thats why i eat out here most of the time unless its raining
709244 he had come to braemond to study magic under some sage or other and we met he brought me to selkwyth
709245 you came all the way to selkwyth because you met some guy
709246 i guess you can say i fell in love with him
709247 thats right in braemond if you kiss someone you have to marry them right
709248 were not that conservative where do you hear all these things
709249 well its just that you seem so so conservative like about clothes and being alone and stuff i just figured
709250 were just like you except maybe a bit more conservative especially about men and women
709251 anyone who has been to a pierhead party knows jaspin hes been with all the girls i tasted him once or twice myself
709252 thats ok im over him for the most part when i found out how popular he was i realized what a fool i had been and left him but by that time i was already in selkwyth so i stayed
709253 yeah but im not staying there im probably not even going to leave the ship
709254 but braemond is your home dont you want to see your family and friends
709255 yeah jok will wonder why im so behind well take care sweetie and let me know if theres anything you need to talk about ok
709256 the main navigational compass is giving odd readings we need you to tell us why
709257 we need some help we think we know how far off the magnetic compasses are but we need your help to reconcile the variances
709258 is the wheel supposed to keep spinning when you close the case
709259 i can see that it doesnt do you know why
709260 its adjusted every morning based on readings from the stars when they adjusted it this morning it stopped spinning
709261 do they have to open the case to do it
709262 no one should be left out of mind no matter how small
709263 gomph wanted me to look at this this compass thing
709264 i hear you are good at seeing the state of rightness in the world
709265 i heard it from the sworl catcher you fixed near the aft observatory
709266 i have important work to do jheffr stay here with filia i can make my own way from here
709267 filia would you mind watching jheffr for me hes still a bit young to be alone on the bridge
709268 i can watch your naked boy its not like i have anything important to do here
709269 i need to work on this please dont touch anything
709270 and i figured out how the air flows in this thing
709271 although why they put the two ports right side by side is beyond me it seems like it would make better sense for the exhaust port to be at the top or off at an angle on the side and bigger much bigger
709272 im not sure how this thing ever worked is this really the only way for the air to get out
709273 i wonder you say this worked fine until they opened it this morning
709274 could it be that there was some sort of air current that they disrupted but then why would it only fail now
709275 when they made this they used a spell to ensure the air flowed through the housing correctly
709276 and that spell failed yesterday as we got too far away
709277 and when they opened the case this morning they disturbed the flow
709278 and patch that other one closed then it should work

709295 have you ever been in love horrible isnt it it makes you so vulnerable it opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up you build up all these defenses you build up a whole suit of armor so that nothing can hurt you then one stupid person no different from any other stupid person wanders into your stupid life you give them a piece of you they didnt ask for it they did something dumb one day like kiss you or smile at you and then your life isnt your own anymore love takes hostages it gets inside you it eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness so simple a phrase like maybe we should be just friends turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart it hurts not just in the imagination not just in the mind its a soul hurt a real gets inside you and rips you apart pain i hate love
709296 i hated the gooks i will hate them as long as i live
709297 there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us
709298 i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows that there are certain kinds of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one thats code for hes uppity he ought to stay in his place everybody gets that who is from a southern background we all understand that when mccain comes out and starts talking about affirmative action im against quotas we get what thats about
709299 not because it asked the question is barack obama ready for the job thats a very legitimate criticism and i think barack obama made it a little bit worse by his stumbling response later the problem is that mccain mccains strategy has to hinge in my view on one thing how does a republican survive in october and november a huge anti republican vote luckily for the party mccain is a different kind of republican so everything in the campaign ought to build toward that case and when if you get off into the small juvenile stuff about britney spears i think you distract from that

709416 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
709417 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
709418 i think the american people deserve more of an accounting on this investigation and some appreciation of how to bring this to closure
709419 i dont know anything about the most recent development and thats unfortunate i think all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
709420 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
709421 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
709422 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

709440 certainly over the past few years there was much foolish lending that had led to severe losses and the economy will suffer in the short run but actions by central banks will assure that this credit crisis does not morph into a full blown recession or worse and in the long run saner lending and more reasonable home prices will lead to a stronger economic recovery

709500 theyve been caught with their hand in the ideological cookie jar
709501 the no 1 issue here is confidence among the american people that cases are taken in a way that isnt influenced by political ideology
709502 to turn a flashlight back on the people whove entered and to re evaluate their admission into the department would be extremely difficult
709503 we hope to solve the mystery behind the death of the two boys ram krishna yadav and vedant manmode in asaram bapus school very soon as suspects have been identified and their interrogation is complete
709504 this is an internal affair of any political party to expel its member from the party on the ground of indiscipline but can we generalise this principle in the case of speaker somnath chatterjee
709505 with chatterjees case the debate to make our democracy healthier should be taken more vigorously
709506 twelve years ago he was declared the best parliamentarian the way he was conducting the proceedings of the parliament impartially for the last four years nobody can raise a finger against him
709507 if we could do that nsg process expeditiously we can deliver the package to the us congress in september we have a lot to to in short term we hope we can bring it to fruition
709508 a partial lunar eclipse will be visible in india throughout most of asia south america europe and australia on august 17
709509 this is a mere accident the explosion occurred in an abandoned shell there is no terrorist involvement i would tell the residents of this city not to panic unnecessarily
709510 in the evening some of them tried to break the shell with a hammer when the explosion occurred this is very sad
709511 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
709512 fuel prices have doubled in the past year a successful hedging programme mitigated the impact but nevertheless fuel costs at 706 million were up 233 million in the quarter we expect our fuel bill to top 3 billion this year the equivalent of more than 8 million every day
709513 these facts will conclusively establish beyond reasonable doubt the veracity of what we had complained
709514 in the absence of the channel having performed its public duty we along with our colleagues have continued to pursue this matter and have several facts to place before you and the inquiry committee
709515 these are direct evidences which can be corroborated by the statements of the mps and members of the cnn ibn team the independent channel which conducted the cash for vote sting operation
709516 the transcript of the video where sanjeev saxena an alleged aide of amar singh and another person reach the ferozshah road residence of one of the mps and gives the money has been given to the head of the parliamentary committee
709517 on the night of july 21 reoti raman singh visits the mps and repeatedly pleads with them that they should meet the man allegedly amar singh for just 10 minutes to finalise a deal
709518 after delivering the cash saxena repeatedly calls amar singh from his mobile to facilitate a conversation of the mps with him when the phone gets disconnected several times reportedly six times saxena dials on the landline of amar singh
709519 we have seen here along with the subversion of parliament subversion of a section of the media those who had taken the responsibility of bringing out the truth have failed to do so in the face of this subversion of truth a political party had to conduct this investigation
709520 the fact is that sanjeev saxena who was reportedly untraceable after july 22 was available to amar singh as way back as july 25 for play acting in a fake cd
709521 indian democracy and its fairness is now on trial our mps have told the committee that it should get phone call details and the audio video and transcript should be married to do a complete investigation
709522 we are committed to take this case to its logical conclusion
709523 it is too early for such things to be answered
709524 we reserve the right to approach the court of law
709525 people in high places conducted a fake sting this is a case of bribe and may go to court
709526 surjeet ji is not among us but his principles will always remain with us he was a great politician who has done a lot for the country
709527 we hope that we can continue to work for the development of the country along with those who believe in his thoughts
709528 comrade surjeet was a great freedom fighter and a great advocate of secularism
709529 he had a significant contribution to the formation of the upa government we all offer lal salam to surjeet who was the real angel for the poor and working class
709530 no doubt a great personality is not among us today but what he has done for the country and for the party can never be forgotten
709531 it is unfortunate in our party we take pride in maintenance of discipline we dont have such situations normally in our party it is unfortunate that it had happened with a person of the stature of somnath chatterjee
709532 i have made it clear we also respect the post of speakership and we do not want to do or say anything which will distract that position
709533 we are not going into the question of defections or disqualification for us it is a straightforward matter the decision to continue as the speaker was his the decision that he should cease to be a member of the party is that of the party once he decided to be there on the speakers chair on 21st and 22nd during confidence vote in the lok sabha we decided to sever our relations
709534 this isnt a flip flop its a sex change operation
709535 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
709536 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
709537 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
709538 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s
709539 looking for something they can count on they can depend on thats constant

709544 when you lose billy wagner thats very critical for us
709545 it got to the point where i couldnt locate the ball inside
709546 its a situation where were at this part of the season where you have time to take some time off
709547 i dont want to hamper the team and continuously fight an uphill battle when weve got it close in the division theres no use going out there and hurting the team by being something that youre not right now
709548 the more rest we give him the better off hell be
709549 the important thing now is to see how he feels tomorrow after that ill put together a schedule to get him back pitching
709550 he threw a lot of breaking balls fastballs and a few cutters
709551 he didnt feel pain initially he had problems getting the breaking ball over and then it started getting more consistent as he finished up look forget all of that whats important is to see how it feels tomorrow and if it feels fine then we can step it up and get him ready to pitch
709552 if theres a hooker you want it all comes down to price right and i think thats a better analogy

709709 rosemarie always looked after the kids so well taking them to school
709710 police said the case came to light only after one of the girls kerstin 19 was admitted to hospital in a critical condition in mid april
709711 the players have been excited about that but they are focused now weve gone through the spiritual experience of being in the beijing olympic village but now weve moved out to qinghuangdao and theres nothing they need to motivate them
709712 that will add another 10 per cent to their performance that spur of knowing that all these people are behind them
709713 you wouldnt miss that sort of thing for the world
709714 but having said that weve been on the road now for more than a month and to reach qinghuangdao at last is a nice feeling were away from a lot of the excitement and distractions
709715 last year they played in front of crowds of 60 000 people when they played against china and 50 000 against brazil
709716 this occasion obviously brings an extra emotional attachment but i think theyll be fine
709717 theyve got their heads screwed on and weve got coping strategies in place and those are acquired through their experience
709718 they play a really attractive style of football but this team feels that their scalp is one we should take in this group and take quite comfortably
709719 that first game is one we see as the most important one if we take three points from that then we know exactly what we need to do to get through this group two draws in the next game could see you through
709720 its just fantastic a great moment and one that ive been targeting for many years now ever since i first saw the possibility of being a formula one driver
709721 of course i felt sorry for felipe and even for lewis as they both drove a great race but i know how they feel as i have had similar moments myself this year
709722 there was not much i could do at the start but after that i tried to just keep it tidy and tight and not go too hard on the tyres in the first two stints which is where i had problems earlier in the season
709723 i tried to push felipe as much as possible at the end and when i saw a car on fire with big smoke coming out on the main straight i thought it must be felipe but it was hard to believe
709724 google utilise la reconnaissance vocale sur certaines vid os de youtube
709725 they did their homework on what they wanted to achieve in terms of putting pressure on us
709726 they certainly targeted certain areas and got a good result out of it when youre a bit off and theyre putting on a bit of pressure it makes for a hard night
709727 you cant go from having a very good lineout to a debacle in one game
709728 what it does is refocus us in that area weve been going quite well in the lineouts until now and im sure that will be the case from here on as well
709729 the disappointing thing for us is that we didnt respond to it well enough
709730 its not one we will look back on with a lot of pride
709731 the all blacks grew an arm and a leg and were prepared to have a crack and get up and they closed the gap and did it successfully
709732 because they were able to build pressure on us in that area we werent able to create a good foundation
709733 we gave them no lineouts and gave them no platform
709734 i was up probably every couple of hours icing it last night i had quite a heavy workload throughout the thursday and friday at the captains run
709735 it just flared up a bit last night i kept that to myself and did a fair bit of icing and took a couple of pills and it seemed to do the trick
709736 i happened to be rooming with rangi throughout the week and he went home early so i had a room to myself i was quite fortunate no one actually knew i was hidden away like bin laden it was good
709737 its probably easy for me to say i was repaying a lot of people first and foremost it was about doing myself proud realising that i am good enough to be here
709738 i have a great family and friend network and they have been amazing over the last six to eight weeks and the coaches and team mates too they have all been supportive
709739 in 2008 the world will be blessed they will call him the one then displaying video of barack speaking eloquently on thousands thus creating an association
709740 once again this is just another low road attempt by john mccain to distract from his own record on latino issues by making false attacks on barack obama on a day when our economy lost another 51 000 jobs and when latino families all over the country are struggling john mccain chose the low road rather than offering a real plan for the latino community what is clear is that barack obama has fought for issues latinos care about for the past 20 years as a community organizer illinois state legislator us senator and as president he will continue his fight for comprehensive immigration reform education equality and healthcare for everyone

709743 she was right on target soaring from a thousand feet up she hit the landing on top of the roof of the car her long legs demurely crossed i couldnt take my eyes off her before i had bought into the romance of the empire state building i knew it from a 1947 photograph of a suicide reprinted in the best of life in the image of this sleeping beauty i saw not only unrequited love but also the skyscrapers sheer gravitational power

709752 ha habido carreras este a o en las que he estado en disposici n de luchar por la victoria pero siempre hubo algo que me fue mal mediada la carrera de hoy las cosas han empezado a ir bien para m y he comenzado a presionar a felipe y finalmente ha funcionado
709753 lo siento por felipe porque ha hecho una gran carrera pero mi coche ha respondido bien y sab a que pod a luchar por la victoria este es un gran momento para m algo que desde hace muchos a os era mi objetivo espero que este triunfo sea el primero de muchos
709754 la carrera podr a haber sido mejor para m mi salida ha sido buena pero la de felipe ha sido mejor y me ha adelantado he conseguido mantener la distancia durante el primer stint espacio de tiempo entre el primer y segundo repostaje y me he sentido c modo en el segundo porque estaba igualando sus tiempos y yo iba a alargar m s mi segunda parada
709755 ten a la sensaci n de que pod a adelantarle massa pero el pinchazo del neum tico ha frenado mis progresos no s qu ha pasado al menos he sumado cuatro puntos y mantengo mi liderato en el campeonato

709803 i think the boat that would top it would be the griffon
709804 if you ask me what in my mind is the holy grail of the great lakes theres no hesitation it would be the griffon
709805 a shipwreck is a container where life stopped at a given time
709806 to tell you the truth ive been looking for shipwrecks for 30 years and very few people that i know of have been searching for that one
709807 but i know probably 50 or 60 people who have always searched for the griffon
709808 its almost like finding the declaration of independence the real one
709809 sailors being a superstitious lot have indicated theyve seen the bannockburn sailing across the foggy horizon of lake superior some evenings
709810 its the ghost ship of lake superior you might say
709811 you know you dont just lose a 350 foot long steel ship in the shallowest of the great lakes
709812 here in the great lakes we dont have the colourful fish and coral that they have down in the tropics but we have the best preserved wrecks in the world
709813 we never had spanish galleons real treasure ships with gold and silver sailing through our waters but what we have is very much a different kind of treasure its a historical treasure
709814 we have targeted several more that we havent found yet that we think are historically significant
709815 we dont really broadcast what were looking for next because we dont really want people following us around
709816 i can tell you for sure that one is on our radar
709817 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
709818 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
709819 we think its got a lot of humour in it were having fun and enjoying it
709820 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
709821 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
709822 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from eight to 80
709823 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
709824 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
709825 b c is trying to position itself in both camps its an inconsistency
709826 i think they the government hope that the people understand that politics is about making hard choices and sometimes one is forced to make choices that arent necessarily consistent with each other
709827 if we do get details of the cap and trade component alongside the carbon tax i think people will be prepared to live with the seeming contradictions
709828 we need to be talking to those industries we need to be talking about what they can do to deal with emissions issues and begin to address that while of course still trying to keep the economy buoyant
709829 theres got to be a discussion and it should be a public discussion where british columbians understand what the implications of this are
709830 its about finding the most cost effective and economically viable ways of reducing the carbon imprint that we all have across the system
709831 we have to move into the new century and into the new framework that asks us to think about our resources not waste them be thrifty with them use them to the maximum ability that we can
709832 i think that as long as fair er trade ultimately leads to fair trade then it ia alright but if fair er trade is substituted for fair trade then there is a problem because there is still the element of exploitation in the process
709833 why dont you give me the option to approve or decline an ad in the mail itself

709837 civil rights groups have begun a welcome attack on a house bill that would temporarily exempt the states from the all important accountability requirements in the no child left behind act which was signed into law in 2002 the attack led by powerful groups like the leadership conference on civil rights was unexpected given that the nation s two big teachers unions actually hold seats on the conference s executive committee recent events suggest that the civil rights establishment generally is ready to break with the teachers unions and take an independent stand on education reform
709838 noise and congestion is invading our quiet corner of the region
709839 the spirit trail is both going to be a journey and a destination
709840 this plan is a wonderful vision for having a trail network that spans one side of our community to the other and that joins us with our neighbouring communities
709841 we have abandoned the routing that has caused such concern
709842 what has brought many of us here including council is a real concern about the integrity of the public process around the spirit trail anger about the conduct of one of our members of staff and opposition to the initial routing of the trail particularly from 19th to 24th
709843 really you have been the canary in the coal mine on this issue
709844 we should enjoy the summer we should not think about this again until the fall and we should proceed with caution
709845 we have failed you i can assure you on my watch this will not happen again
709846 information got out and that resulted in the people being here today
709847 i do not i have not and i will not ever i think its ludicrous frankly
709848 most of my neighbours oppose the path because its right there you can reach out and touch the cyclists
709849 my concern is that a relatively small group of west vancouver residents here are taking options off the table when we havent had an opportunity to fully consider all options
709850 i would be very concerned if as a result of this meeting tonight options for the section that is obviously controversial are taken off the table
709851 it is very dangerous out there for cyclists with all the cars
709852 there has been very little done for all the taxes paid for the cyclists in west van
709853 it is the only continuous flat traffic free route between north vancouver and horseshoe bay for that reason it has a lot of reasons to attract people cyclists and pedestrians
709854 there are parts of the greenway that will have to be within the cn right of way because we really do not have any other options
709855 we want to get more people cycling and more people walking but we also want to make sure those that are cycling and walking are safer
709856 as far as i am concerned this cant be built fast enough i think this is absolutely wonderful
709857 no comment on anything related to the vice presidential issue
709858 we crawled to the border that was our solution and i think we stayed at the border for two or three hours until the israeli army let the injured enter
709859 fatah officials in gaza should stay in their posts and should not leave gaza to hamas
709860 continue to hope even if we fight between each other or have differences
709861 will quickly discover it committed a very big act of stupidity
709862 the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased
709863 she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me
709864 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
709865 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
709866 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
709867 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
709868 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
709869 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
709870 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
709871 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
709872 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
709873 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
709874 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
709875 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
709876 i think its come to the point where there needs to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
709877 packers president and ceo mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
709878 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
709879 they have caused me no end of grief as a result of that story
709880 although i wont be going ahead with that particular announcement today i am pleased that this announcement is real and going ahead
709881 to provide greenway access from the lower lonsdale waterfront to moodyville park and on to sunrise park and park and tilford centre
709882 to provide separate path and on road bicycle lands and sidewalks as well as a staircase with wheelchair accessible bypass on a 3 5 kilometre greenway that will link north vancouvers alpine area with the waterfront
709883 the trail will also harmonize with other recreational activities in the park including tennis and a kayak canoe launch
709884 approximately 15 km in length the west vancouver greenway path generally follows the foreshore utilizing existing pathways lanes park roads local roads and the rail right of way path segments independent of existing roads will be paved and lit
709885 when that happens on the field usually guys have helmets on
709886 he was trying to apologize so i was walking with him just to be there
709887 i dont anticipate this having any lingering effect on this team
709888 we were talked to and things were squashed thats it thats the way it is it happened there will be no retaliation by anybody on anything when you look at the schedule we dont play the panthers this year so we need to be smart when were out there
709889 when i was 22 i was a different guy so im not trying to spin anything
709890 you spend two hours with somebody and now you know them thats not the case
709891 obviously everybody is going to be waiting to see what the repercussions are from this event
709892 im just praying that we rally together as a team because obviously theres going to be some adversity here the focus is not where it needs to be right now
709893 im hoping we can all come together as a team as a family and are able to put this behind us
709894 the white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the
709895 sources say the new data do not indicate the discovery of existing or past life on mars
709896 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect
709897 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
709898 the reason that all this seems so hush hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the american association for the advancement of science aaas and its
709899 whatever the poop is from the scoop thats been studied by phoenix that information is purportedly going through peer review
709900 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year
709901 what that says is the transmission rate has been kept very low by prevention efforts
709902 these data corroborate what many of us suspected that the epidemic is worse than we thought however it doesnt seem to be getting worse
709903 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century

709921 as peta and other anti fishing activists gear up for another year of protest their tactics are likely to become more confrontational they will follow the example by a few activists in the uk with their campaign for the abolition of angling in europe we can find the antis very active especially in germany and holland the european greens could also prove dangerous to angling which brings me to another point if youre planning to vote for the green party in the coming elections ask your candidate what their views are on fishing as a sport the anti fishing movement in germany make a practice of throwing rocks into popular fishing waters and sending scuba divers down to spook the fish i am also told that all fish caught must be killed silly you say sure but effective remember protests have produced fishing bans on some lakes and streams in europe though many of you anglers would like to believe otherwise petas campaign and the media attention it already attracts is no joke its a serious business and remember they want to ban the keeping of animals as pets including fish in tanks

709928 there is a shift in the market the market has moved from being concerned with inflation pressures to realising that perhaps growth is slowing enough across the board to eventually contain inflation pressures so they have started to reprice risks
709929 in areas like the u s it does help the central bank
709930 both debt and equity investors as well as policymakers should cheer
709931 further decline in commodities will be equity market friendly to the extent that headline inflation also recedes subsequent fed eases should steepen the u s yield courtesy of a front end rally
709932 this suggests that even with the ecbs higher weight on inflation since the july rate hike a near term rate hike is unlikely
709933 however we expect that with inflation rates around 2 percent in mid 2009 and ongoing weak economic growth the ecb will cut rates eventually
709934 it makes it relatively easier for central banks but it doesnt mean they dont have to hike interest rates especially in places in india or brazil

709944 la capacitaci n del docente debe centrarse en formarlos para que puedan trabajar con los chicos en la nueva realidad una capacitaci n que debe ser variada cada instituci n debe preparar su propio itinerario de formaci n
709945 por un lado es hacer visible el fen meno que se reconozca ya que realmente la convivencia en las escuelas se ha ido deteriorando lentamente a partir de eso lo que tenemos que hacer es ver cu les son los tipos de indisciplina y violencia que se est n produciendo porqu se producen porqu se generan determinados climas dentro de la escuela no se debe pensar que la violencia social se mete adentro de la escuela y listo la violencia existe pero toma formas particulares el contexto lo lleva a que tenga determinadas caracter sticas y esto es lo que los docentes tienen que reconocer por el otro se debe dar una respuesta educativa no solamente se debe detectar el problema sino que debe existir una respuesta educativa que se anticipe debemos generar la buena convivencia que para ello tambi n se educa

709981 was f r ein unglaubliches gef hl ich konnte es gar nicht glauben als ich massa motor hochgehen sah und ich dadurch auf platz zwei fuhr so ein gutes ergebnis in meinem ersten jahr bei toyota ist fantastisch als ich kimi hinter mir im spiegel sah wusste ich dass ich mir keine fehler erlauben durfte
709982 es tut mir leid f r felipe und das team und es ist schrecklich ein rennen so zu verlieren f r mich war das rennen sehr schwer denn es ist frustrierend und langweilig hinter einem langsameren wagen zu fahren jetzt m ssen wir die probleme beheben um im qualifying wieder vorne zu stehen wenn wir das schaffen k mpfen wir wieder um siege
