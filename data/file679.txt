6790001 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
6790002 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
6790003 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature

6790013 es ist immer ein genuss auf eine neue anlage zu kommen und ich bin beeindruckt
6790014 es war dort drau en ziemlich hei aber die strecke macht viel spa und das layout ist interessant ich mag stra en kurse denn ich bin w hrend meiner zeit in der champcar in amerika auf vielen gefahren aber abgesehen vom hafen und den geb uden sieht dies nicht wirklich nach einem stra en kurs aus da er so lange geraden hat
6790015 wir hatten einen guten tag das erste training war etwas schwierig und die strecke war sehr staubig dies hatten wir jedoch erwartet der nachmittag war viel besser und das auto kam mehr und mehr in richtung des setup fensters ich hoffe dass wir in dieser richtung weiter arbeiten k nnen denn es war ein produktiver tag
6790016 wir m ssen die balance des autos anpassen wir m ssen uns dies heute abend anschauen die strecke ist nichtsdestotrotz gut und ich mag sie im kart sport waren wir es gewohnt auf einer menge stra en kurse zu fahren es braucht aus diesem grund nicht viel zeit sie zu lernen
6790017 man muss im hinblick auf das setup jedoch einen kompromiss finden denn es gibt eine mischung aus langsamen kurven und schnelleren sektionen mit langen geraden das wichtigste ist wie sehr sich der asphalt im verlauf des wochenendes ver ndern wird der asphalt ist ziemlich glatt und w hrend er heute wie erwartet rutschig war sollte sich die haftung verbessern es wird aus diesem grund schwierig sein das setup richtig hinzubekommen
6790018 das wichtigste wenn man auf eine neue strecke geht ist es ohne technische probleme durch dein programm zu kommen
6790019 dies war heute der fall am ersten tag auf einer neuen strecke haben wir unseren blichen plan angewandt heute f hrten wir sowohl zu beginn des ersten freien trainings mehrere longruns durch um die strecke zu lernen als auch am ende des zweiten freien trainings um dabei zu helfen das verhalten des reifens zu beurteilen da wir hier keine anhaltspunkte haben
6790020 abgesehen davon hat man es zum ziel die balance und den richtigen abtriebs level zu finden es scheint hier nicht viel haftung zu geben und diese hat sich nicht so sehr verbessert wie wir dies erwartet hatten dennoch sind wir ganz gl cklich dar ber wo wir mit timo stehen jarno hingegen k mpft etwas mit einer inkonstanten balance wir m ssen uns dies aus diesem grund anschauen und es f r morgen beheben
6790021 am morgen fuhren wir die bestzeit aber wir geh rten zu den wenigen teams die gegen ende der sitzung neue reifen nahmen
6790022 er ist etwas untypisch denn der asphalt ist sehr griffig anfangs hat er sehr wenig grip gehabt weil die strecke sehr schmutzig war aber generell ist der asphalt sehr griffig es ist eher eben es gibt wenig bodenwellen das ist eher das untypische auch dass man hier und da etwas mehr auslauf hat
6790023 insgesamt kann man ihn schon noch in die kategorie stra enkurs einordnen
6790024 man kommt da im siebten gang mit voller lotte dort an dann eine links rechts kombination und mitten in der rechtskurve muss man anfangen zu bremsen sonst bekommt man zielkurve nicht mehr da wird das auto sehr leicht das ist sehr sehr schwierig
6790025 im auto f hlt man das nicht es ist die einzige welle auf dem kurs ansonsten w rde man etwas vermissen das ist aber eine sehr interessante sektion sie ist recht langsam aber wirklich schwierig man muss eine gute fahrzeugbeherrschung haben und die scheitelpunkte immer genau treffen es macht spa
6790026 das kann man nicht vergleichen hier gibt es zum beispiel viele geraden die kurven sind zwar auch langsam aber der kurs ist technisch sehr fordernd das ist f r stra enkurse etwas un blich das stimmt schon aber der asphalt ist sehr griffig
6790027 ich bin heute morgen und am nachmittag einigen autos gefolgt und ich glaube dass es eine m glichkeit gibt aber das wird schwierig vor den kurven 12 und 17 gibt es chancen
6790028 es ist nicht allein wegen des layouts der strecke einfacher es ist noch immer schwierig
6790029 wenn man in einem mclaren oder ferrari sitzt dann hat man keine wahl man ist gezwungen zu sagen dass man gewinnen oder das auto auf die pole stellen will es kommt darauf an wie schnell die anderen sind wir wollen unsere eigene leistung maximieren wir sind auf einem guten weg hatten zwei gute trainings alles was wir testen wollten konnten wir auch testen wir haben klare antworten bekommen

6790036 earlier thursday assad backed russias military action against georgia at talks with president dmitry medvedev on thursday according to russian media assad offered to host the russian missiles as a response to a deal signed by washington and warsaw this week to deploy elements of a u s missile defense system in poland which has aggravated moscows relations with the west assads visit is likely to become an additional irritant for washington in the past the united states has more than once warned moscow against selling arms to its longstanding ally syria
6790037 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6790038 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region

6790107 where soil phosphorous levels are low 10 20 parts per million mehlich iii or bray 1 p or very low less than 10 ppm the likelihood of a wheat yield response to phosphorous is greater than 50 percent
6790108 often the yield response is great enough to more than pay for the phosphorous fertilizer even at todays prices
6790109 early season phosphorous deficiency can limit wheat yield potential the first five to six weeks after emergence is the critical period wheat absorbs about 18 percent of its total seasonal phosphorus uptake in just the first two weeks of growth
6790110 it doesnt take much added phosphorous fertilizer with the proper timing and placement to have a big effect on early season development and yields
6790111 the regulations are that if they do it more than three times they will be expelled from the league they are doing this for the second time now and the third time will see them out of the league
6790112 as i understand it they withdrew because they fear to be victimised and assaulted by us they suspect that we will retaliate for a past incident which had nothing to do with us
6790113 now it is for that reason that they are afraid to play against us at our home ground in fact we dont have any problem to play against them and we are not hooligans that incident has nothing to do with us and there is no way that our players or supporters will engage in unruly behaviour of wanderers come and play us
6790114 up to now the nru has done nothing about that it is sad and a big shame that the rugby authorities do not have strict regulations for matters such as these to be looked into and acted upon

6790116 any number of odd drawings that will never alone sight the light of day because i dont like them enough anymore to actually put any effort into finishing them up
6790117 while we have been affected by the increased frequency of natural perils widening credit spreads and soft cycles in key markets we have acknowledged we need to do better
6790118 were seeing premiums go up in our home book but the pricing moves vary from region to region
6790119 but it is an incompetence youre right its not a conspiracy
6790120 it should have been 100 per cent and is now
6790121 the bottom line is that we were in a business we should never have entered into in the first place
6790122 we then compounded the problem by not having the usual risk assessments
6790123 management action was too slow and follow up was poor
6790124 to sum it up i would say it was a failure to connect the dots
6790125 limited understanding of the existence or significant scale of the equity finance business before march 2005
6790126 one employees account had been out of order and accordingly subject to a margin call since october 2005 with 293 000 owing as at march 2008
6790127 the employee had been allowed to trade and increase the account even though it was subject to a margin call
6790128 they received a benefit from a customer with whom they had an ongoing business relationship and were in a position to treat that customer favourably whether or not they did so
6790129 of these five employees only one had disclosed the existence of their account to their line manager

6790137 the choice of a particular investment option is critical to all australians financial future
6790138 if theres one area where wed like to see further details fleshed out between the bracks report and what the government ultimately decides its whats happening around the investment attraction of new vehicle builds
6790139 there is comment in the report about the roaming auto ambassadors and using them from a trade and export perspective but one of the things wed really like to see governments step up is the international investment attraction approach
6790140 what weve effectively got here is a comparable range of programs of building vehicles but there needs to be much more onus put on selling that message internationally so that the spread of vehicle builds and type of vehicle builds here can be increased
6790141 something like 90 to 95 per cent of it goes into markets where there are more than 500 000 units being manufactured
6790142 were about 330 000 at the moment and from a vehicle build perspective getting that number north of 500 000 really does take the industry down the path of being able to stand on its own two feet
6790143 youre dealing with an industry that is going to be in the supply chain less reliant on government assistance

6790156 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
6790157 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
6790158 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
6790159 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
6790160 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
6790161 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
6790162 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
6790163 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
6790164 the bottom line is it is not effective jim hayes acting director of ices detention and removal operations said
6790165 advocates and supporters of universal preschool often use existing research for purely political purposes
6790166 but the solid evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions is limited to those conducted on disadvantaged populations
6790167 generally when you talk to leaders of large companies over there theres always an air of optimism about the chinese economy
6790168 but in the past couple of months reports about the us slowdown have filtered through to affect sentiment in china
6790169 there is also a definite downturn in some of the larger cities which can be noted in the profits for some of the large companies and a downturn in chinas major stock exchanges
6790170 and theres a downturn in the sentiment of people investing its not uncommon now for people to be a bit more reserved a bit more cautious than they would have been six to 12 months ago
6790171 and as commodity prices come off theres a likelihood that mining companies will be looking at lay offs as a way of surviving
6790172 things are undoubtedly going to slow down after the olympics which will contribute to the downward pressure on the economy
6790173 however its unlikely to be that serious china has experienced a big increase in prices over the past couple of years so theyve pushed up interest rates to dampen economic growth
6790174 one thing follows the other its been a problem in china for 30 years as it goes through this boom bust cycle the government has to maintain a tightrope between keeping the economy kicking along reasonably well and not letting price increases get out of hand
6790175 eight gives the audience an opportunity to get inside the heads of some very complex 20 something people

6790187 this rigorous precision matching technique was employed to construct a random sample of non pre k students that matched the pre k group as closely as possible in all possible respects given the data available for the analysis
6790188 although pre k students initially demonstrated an advantage on these assessments over peers who did not participate in pre k by the second grade there was no statistically significant difference in these groups
6790189 for almost twenty one years from a d 117 to 138 publius aelius hadrianus ruled one of the mightiest empires the world has ever seen
6790190 at the heart of the empire was rome the largest city of the ancient mediterranean if not the globe a pulsating capital of one million inhabitants
6790191 the empire needed to gain strength and cohesion in order to be able to face the many threats to its prosperity and peaceful existence my italics hadrians achievements in these areas were outstanding his legacy immense
6790192 the closer it got to the olympics they changed their policy
6790193 we dont want ever to be seen as being sanctioned by the government
6790194 we were working to get at least some of them
6790195 its now apparent that they wont come we had to think long and hard about whether to proceed we made the decision to go forward
6790196 they said they would see what they could do but we should see about postponing the show until after the olympics
6790197 even though this is a period many would prefer to forget it is nevertheless one that produced a visual culture that continues to permeate contemporary chinese art
6790198 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

6790209 boy that was fun maybe i should write about cooking more often
6790210 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6790211 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour
6790212 we shifted a match from karachi to lahore on one occasion to ensure best security for them pakistan cricket has been going out its way since 9 11 to accommodate and ensure touring teams are given state level security
6790213 the icc is trying hard to assure all teams that conditions are safe to play in pakistan and a teleconference of the executive board is to be held on sunday south africa should have waited until then
6790214 its important now to find compounds that can be used in imaging because the earlier clinicians can detect the disease the better the chances are that a drug will halt disease progression while patients still have strong cognitive abilities
6790215 when we added these compounds to the reaction their interaction with the tau protein inhibited filaments from forming which could be valuable for therapeutics because it would prevent the formation of tau tangles some people think if we clear away the pathology seen in diseased brains that might alleviate symptoms of alzheimers disease

6790222 its an area that can be operated in operated through operated across that can create effects in other domains or be supported by operations in other domains
6790223 the thing that separates this domain from the others is that it operates at the speed of light
6790224 people talk about defending or exploiting cyberspace but we dont talk much about operating it if its under attack
6790225 its not easy work and its not work to be taken on by amateurs
6790226 every time we have a problem or a virus is loaded or someone comes in and takes over systems administration of a computer or a server we have to take that system offline scrub it and sometimes throw it away guess what that aint free
6790227 were trying to get our arms around how much this is costing us every time someone breaks into our niprnet unclassified but sensitive internet protocol router network some estimates are around 100 million a year some people think that figure is low
6790228 if youre in combat and have to get an important message through anything that slows down the network is a real threat
6790229 we blacklist things we say the following things arent allowed on the niprnet

6790231 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6790232 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6790233 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6790234 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6790235 there has been far too little asking the people of the region themselves what they thought and what they wanted
6790236 the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
6790237 fibrosis is a disease of many organs lungs kidneys pancreas prostate skin
6790238 its possible this mechanism in the liver is relevant to fibrotic situations in other tissues
6790239 once a lot of extracellular matrix has formed its very hard to clear
6790240 the material just sits there and creates an inflammatory environment
6790241 we suggest that following tissue damage hepatic stellate cells become activated and proliferate intensely senesce and are eventually cleared to protect the liver from an excessive fibrogenic response to acute injury

6790246 these tiers were imposed on apd by the legislature which was frustrated with the lack of control
6790247 it was because of their inability to manage their budget and have a vision for cost efficient services
6790248 we have a moral and ethical obligation to these folks
6790249 whether it means going to get community support we will make it happen

6790251 as kids we swam from the time we were 2 years old
6790252 she is all over the place so obviously we dont get to go there and cheer her on
6790253 it means the world to her does to us too to be able to support her
6790254 her day hasnt been the greatest so far its always good to get at least one real positive out of the day
6790255 im not going to lie it was tough throughout the day sheila and i both are ready to pack up and go home
6790256 but i couldnt have asked to be here with a better teammate it was an honor to be here with her
6790257 i was ready to walk off the strip halfway through the fencing bouts
6790258 my sister sudee halfway through it i went up to her and i said i cant take it i cant take it and she said the most wise words anyone could have ever said
6790259 she said you cannot want you cannot want and she just looked at me and i said youre right i take whatevers given
6790260 but htv i dont have any on my resume and while im curious about how long george gets to ogle boobies im more immediately concerned with how long i can ogle boobies
6790261 im not sure if im a bar or a club
6790262 hi my name is oooga moogu the cro magnon with 20 20 vision
6790263 so tell me ephraim did you lose any of your brothers at the battle of shiloh or were you too busy staring at a field nurses rack to notice
6790264 i could buy the entire caribbean but i want to eradicate aids in africa instead
6790265 look at the heart i just ripped out of that mountain lion honey whos your oooga moogu
6790266 were happy to be back on top this would help us going into our last three games
6790267 they got a lot of confidence from their win from us theyre due for a loss they won eight consecutive games and i think its about time they lose
6790268 if you noticed we stretched out we didnt give them open looks early on we limited their three points shots i think were successful on that part
6790269 our goal is to go all out in our remaining games the players are working hard to win
6790270 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
6790271 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
6790272 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
6790273 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
6790274 why am i always the one that gets syphilis or sleeps with demons and bug women
6790275 its when you have sex with someone with the disease without using appropriate protection and you catch a venereal disease off them your penis grows spots turns black and falls off thats why condoms are so important

6790279 my car was my pride and joy there wasnt a scratch on it
6790280 i had put 60 000 into that car and these guys only had it for 15 minutes and they wrote it off it makes you wonder how many other cars they have taken out for joy rides
6790281 whenever a nice car came in they were all itching to take it for a drive
6790282 i saw them do burn outs speed and drive erratically on test drives and their attitude was its not my car
6790283 they have just told me a lot of lies at first it had been side swiped then they had swerved to miss a car and finally they said they had tried to dodge a runaway dog
6790284 any time a vehicle is on the road it is at risk of being involved in an accident
6790285 i was sitting on the lounge when i heard this huge bang
6790286 it was inhumane the whale was struggling so much it dragged the boats about 50m
6790287 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell its been separated from its mother and it is confused i have never seen anything like this
6790288 it has been a comedy of errors all week and i cant understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6790289 they gave the animal the end you would want to give your cat or dog
6790290 so we can draw on the best knowledge there is

6790293 sadly it is becoming quite clear that the medicare program has been and is wasting billions of taxpayers dollars
6790294 at a time when lawmakers are looking for ways to help sustain a program that is running in the red this report underscores the critical need to put better policies in place that will detect and prevent fraud before cms ever cuts a check
6790295 i am saddened embarrassed and concerned reading the surveyors observations about our psychiatric unit
6790296 all of the employees physicians and volunteers understand that the community must have absolute trust in the operation of our psychiatric unit
6790297 there was no evidence of the facility ensuring patient safety after the first incident and a delay of implementing safety approaches after the second incident
6790298 the concern is always to be sure the patients are receiving quality care in a safe environment
6790299 that means the dollars flow out of this community and into the pockets of investors
6790300 i think we need to show progress we need to show a profit in october
6790301 i need to show the analysts that we are on the right track
6790302 i still feel we did the right thing overall for this organization and this community
6790303 we could be faulted for it but we think we made the right decisions
6790304 i think you and all the staff should be congratulated for this approach

6790316 nearly all of our 67 counties will have been impacted by the time fay leaves our state and these funds will help our local and state partners recoup the costs of keeping floridians safe
6790317 the expectation is fay will continue to spread this 8 to 15 inches of rainfall along all of the interstate 10 corridor
6790318 its moving at a very slow rate of speed and that slow rate of speed is going to continue right through the weekend

6790325 as i said before brandon is not a sociopath this is not some crazy kid
6790326 what i am trying to establish given the mandatory harsh sentencing that goes with trying a 14 year old as an adult is explaining what was going on how this tragedy happened not trying to minimize it or take anything away from the tragedy but at least provide it in the context which we think would provide a partial defense on behalf of brandon

6790333 clean out the gear here before you come up unwind the screw and clip it on here

6790336 growing up playing music i didnt like the way that things sounded playing in a basement or garage
6790337 for me the creation of a soundscape on a record where you place the microphones on the drum kit where you place the microphone in relation to your voice all that stuff is what i love about music
6790338 we kind of signed to two labels at once ato being the small indie label and rca the big financial backer we were fortunate we had a lot of great people at rca that took care of us
6790339 then they merged with sony bmg and a lot of the people we knew got fired we were stuck with this huge dinosaur that still wants to charge people 20 per cd they put copyright protection software on our album that ended up screwing up a lot of peoples computers im glad we got to try the major label thing but we would never do it again
6790340 its kind of like an honor system or a grab basket
6790341 ive got a lot of friends that download music for free i dont hold that against anybody because people need a lot of things that they dont have so if somebody wants to hear our record and they take it im glad they can listen to it but if you do get on your feet or if you do steal a record and end up liking it go buy a t shirt go pay for a ticket support them its so weird that you could ever put a price tag on music if you get a record and you listen to it every day its this huge part of your life its worth a lot you should maybe give them 300 for it if you only listen to it a couple times maybe you should only give them 50 cents for it
6790342 live music will never die you can never kill it or download it i think we forget sometimes that humans are animals and animals like to be together in packs

6790371 i was curious about the whale everyone was talking about it and how it would come right up to the boat
6790372 of course i was a little worried at first that he might rock the boat when he touched it or something but he never did anything like that
6790373 the first time we went out we saw him around the bell buoy and it was within minutes that he was over by our boat
6790374 the next time we went out we sat for about 15 minutes before he finally surfaced and came near
6790375 belugas are social in nature and theyre acoustic in communicative
6790376 theres nobody there of his own species to socialize with or to talk to or will talk back to him
6790377 it goes beyond curiosity its an innate need for this beluga to find social interaction and investigate anything that is acoustic in nature in his habitat hes trying to fill a void
6790378 given that belugas are very opportunistic feeders and have a wide variety of food that theyll look for its likely theres enough food around for him
6790379 because hes chosen to live in one area of water thats constantly moving because of the tidal current it means that in order for him to stay in that hes constantly working hes expending a lot of energy
6790380 theres that question that hes getting enough calories to offset the amount of energy hes expending to stay in the area if yes then he will be fine if no then over time he could definitely weaken
6790381 it is something that we can pretty much predict is going to happen at least somewhere in atlantic canada every year

6790387 a lot of science stuff that i never thought about like stuff about the stars how to track ducks and how to find tagged ducks
6790388 i spent my childhood watching my dad paint wildlife and he donated many of his paintings to duc

6790390 we had pens to catch them in and we banded them all by ourselves

6790413 im still competing as hard as i can with the opportunities i get

6790415 i think i have a pretty good idea right now in my head of where they are
6790416 i think when youre in this business you know that things can happen anytime

6790458 the recently held integrated committee of ministers meeting in manzini swaziland urged member states to remove restrictions in fact we have urged countries with surplus maize to sell their produce within the region
6790459 but at the end of the day it is a commercial decision we can only advise member states to prioritise the region
6790460 these measures impede grain flowing from surplus to deficit areas within the region
6790461 it is a travesty that 95 percent of all the grain imported by countries in sub saharan africa is grown by farmers on other continents only five percent of this grain comes from exports by neighbouring countries
6790462 kenya dropped its import tariff on maize from uganda and tanzania as part of the east african commission trade agreement there has been a notable improvement in maize price stability since that time

6790512 die commerzbank hat den anlegern der vip medienfonds jahrelang mit einem verzicht auf die angeblich bestehende verj hrungseinrede sand in die augen gestreut jetzt baut sie offenbar darauf dass die anleger die flinte ins korn werfen
6790513 die vip anleger k nnen ihre beraterbank mindestens noch bis zum 31 12 2008 verklagen
6790514 die bank setzt wahrscheinlich auf ein fragw rdiges urteil aus frankfurt und baut bei der verj hrung auf eine f r sie vorteilhafte zeitrechnung

6790573 i often ask them about their lifestyle if they work from home things like that that way the design consultant can customize their home to their needs the more dialogue we have with a buyer the better off theyll be

6790586 to read history with a map in order to keep up in the mind the indissoluble connexion between history and geography and that a glance of the country may recall the exploits of the hero or the virtues of the patriot who has immortalized it
6790587 the reason for this is that there is more inventory of homes to be sold than there are willing and qualified buyers
6790588 builders are often willing to throw in options and upgrades they normally would have charged tens of thousands of dollars for when buyers were lining up at their doors
6790589 the best prices seem to be on what builders typically call spec or inventory homes
6790590 these are homes built before there is a buyer or homes they had sold but the buyer did not complete the transaction i have seen builders make huge reductions on these homes to get them sold
6790591 we purchased a new very spacious spec home in lakewood crossing in hampshire
6790592 we could never have afforded a home of this size in the area we originally moved from
6790593 but its actually what many friends our age have done as well
6790594 what this means to a buyer whether a first time buyer or a move up buyer is that the builders are willing to consider creative purchase terms some builders are willing to participate in a swap of a less expensive property
6790595 we had looked at over 32 homes in several counties
6790596 we found a home in villa park we needed to sell
6790597 since the inventory is large sellers must present the property in great condition in order to compete in the marketplace
6790598 if the buyers home inspection does indicate that a repair is required the cost can be negotiated between the buyer and seller and can be done prior to closing
6790599 a very old charming two story cape cod in a well established section of new lenox
6790600 the home was recently remodeled on the inside and was move in ready
6790601 as soon as we walked through the door we felt like we were home
6790602 when first time buyers consider existing homes they get more flexibility with location and property type
6790603 new construction that they can afford is most likely on the outer limits of the suburbs so existing homes may be the way to go if their commute is a concern and buyers may be able to purchase in an area where they could not have just a few years ago due to the drop in prices
6790604 this is not our dream home but we are definitely on the right path
6790605 it has three bedrooms a full unfinished basement and a huge unfinished yard we are willing to put in a little work to make it our dream home

6790673 the withdrawal timetables which bush administration officials called aspirational goals rather than fixed dates are contained in the draft of an agreement that still must be approved by prime minister nuri kamal al maliki and other iraqi leaders before it goes before iraq s fractious parliament it has the support of the bush administration american and iraqi officials said american officials stressed repeatedly that meeting the timetables depended on the security situation in iraq where sectarian killings and attacks on american troops have declined sharply over the past year from the peak levels in 2006 and 2007 iraqi officials who have pushed for an even tighter target date for the united states to end its military operations could also end up rejecting the draft agreement even so the accord indicates that the bush administration is prepared to commit the united states to ending most combat operations in iraq in less than a year a much shorter time frame than seemed possible politically or militarily even a few months ago president bush and many leading republicans including the party s presumptive nominee for president senator john mccain had repeatedly dismissed timetables for pulling out of iraq as an admission of defeat that would empower america s enemies

6790688 the policy is aimed at upholding the principle of equality before the law
6790689 the cost of funds in international markets where we raise about a third of our capital is still rising
6790690 if that trend continues and some of our domestic funding costs also rise as we expect then we will not be able to pass on any or all of further rba cuts indeed it is possible that our mortgage rates may start rising even as the cash rate is falling
6790691 people say why cant you just take less profit and give people cheaper mortgages
6790692 but if we did the international credit rating agencies would look at our margins being squeezed and our profits falling and would probably reduce our aa credit rating which in turn would mean wed have to pay more for our funds then wed have to raise mortgage rates again anyway
6790693 our focus has to be on maintaining that financial stability especially in such uncertain times that means our focus has to be on our own costs not on what the rba does if that means that we have to ignore rba cuts then so be it it will be to everybodys benefit in the end
6790694 if the rba was cutting rates and the banks were going in the opposite direction the rba will cut its cash rate to help bring average rates down
6790695 ultimately if the economy needs help with lower rates the rba will do what it takes to deliver those lower rates with a sharply lower cash rate
6790696 anntaylors bottom line performance is impressive in light of the negative comp same store sales and we view guidance as conservative

6790702 i found this summers acting experience to be very positive
6790703 it gave me a real world setting in which i could apply the things ive learned about my craft and it also gave me a very clear and realistic view of where i fit as an actor and what i might expect to encounter in other theatres to top it off ive been given the opportunity to work with some amazingly talented and successful directors and choreographers with whom i hope to stay in touch for a very long time

6790798 susan roths experience and leadership in design research socially responsible design and interdisciplinary design education make her a perfect fit for ocad
6790799 her decision to join us is yet another sign of our universitys increasingly global reach and ability to attract the best and brightest faculty and students from around the world
6790800 as a designer and as an academic im really excited to be coming to ocad at a time when its launching new masters programs and expanding and renewing its already cutting edge undergraduate curriculum
6790801 professor roths appointment is great news not just for our faculty of design but for our entire university
6790802 i know that our faculty and students cant wait to welcome her to toronto and to ocad

6790806 you literally could make an object of any imaginable shape or design an object of any imaginable shape and simply hit the print command and the matter would take that shape
6790807 the late arthur c clarke famed british author and inventor had this wonderful quote any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic and thats what programmable matter is its a technology so advanced it might as well be magic
6790808 and well go from millimeters to microns i guess some time over the next five to 10 years
6790809 the programming questions are even more profound people are struggling to program four cores or eight cores and when larrabee comes out several dozens of cores
6790810 how would you program a million or a billion pieces of programmable matter what does programming even mean
6790811 wouldnt it be nice sometime in the future if we can get rid of the cords you wouldnt have a battery in the sense you do now

6790813 theyll be built into the tables or into the walls and they will just keep you going
6790814 it did give staff some extra time to spend with their families through the summer
6790815 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6790816 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6790817 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6790818 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
6790819 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
6790820 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6790821 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
6790822 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6790823 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6790824 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6790825 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6790826 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6790827 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6790828 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6790829 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
6790830 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
6790831 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
6790832 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
6790833 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature

6790893 tobacco and cigarettes are the staple currency in many prisons so it seems appropriate to price up the cost of securing the data on this memory stick in terms of baccy
6790894 considering that details of all 84 000 prisoners in england and wales were stored on this memory stick its astonishing to think that the data could have been secured for around ten pounds a little less than the price of a 50 gram packet of golden virginia baccy in a newsagents or a prison shop
6790895 the situation could become a political affair of course if the british taxpayer is forced to pick up the tab for credit monitoring of the entire british prison population which works out at 23 000 packets of golden virginia baccy by my calculation

6790918 legal barriers make it much more complex to hold securities cross border and lead to higher costs for transactions and credit in addition they cause difficulties and uncertainty among investors when exercising their rights in corporate actions abroad the legal certainty groups work will help us to bring down these barriers i particularly welcome the fact that the group has addressed issues that could prove instrumental in making our post trading market more competitive also its contribution to preparing the way for an industry led consolidation of the european post trading environment will provide additional support for the code of conduct on clearing and settlement

6790948 we are liberians and have to protect the constitution therefore we have taken the issue to court for judicial review and interpretation so that it can tell us whether we are wrong to protect the constitution because it is only the constitution that guides us as a nation
6790949 we dont consider the elections it was a vain process and as for senator lassana we will deal with that later but the constitution should take precedence because we want to know why it was violated

6791032 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided
6791033 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6791034 with financial conditions already quite fragile the sudden unanticipated failure of bear stearns would have led to a sharp unwinding of positions in those markets that could have severely shaken the confidence of market participants

6791039 it was an interesting day for us to run on a new track the circuit is very challenging but feels more like a permanent race track than a street circuit as it has lots of run off areas and long straights and very smooth asphalt it was however difficult in the morning with lots of dust and very hard to get a good lap out of it in the afternoon it was better but it was still quite dusty and once you got a little bit off line you got no grip at all everything was really as normal with a standard programme with the tyres we have some issues with graining as usual but overall i am quite pleased with the day the seamless shift is a very good step and i was happy with the progress
6791040 today we ran through our normal programme even though it was a new circuit its a pretty good track nice to drive although it was very dirty and slippery in the morning we had a very good second session with some quick times and made some strong progress on the set up the seamless box is working well and we can push quite hard but lets see what happens for tomorrow and qualifying

6791053 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
6791054 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
6791055 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
6791056 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

6791058 the u s has long been involved in supporting freedom movements throughout this region that have been attempting to replace russian influence with u s corporate control the cia national endowment for democracy and freedom house includes zbigniew brzezinski former cia director james woolsey and obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake have been key funders and supporters of placing politicians in power throughout central asia that would play ball with our side none of this is about the good guys versus the bad guys it is power bloc politics big money is at stake b oth parties republican and democrat share a bi partisan history and agenda of advancing corporate interests in this part of the world obamas advisers just like mccains one of his top advisers was recently a lobbyist for the current government in georgia are thick in this stew
6791059 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave after all saakashvili owes his entire political career to american power brokers and us intelligence agencies if he disobeyed them hed be gone in a fortnight besides an operation like this takes months of planning and logistical support especially if its perfectly timed to coincide with the beginning of the olympic games another petty neocon touch that means pentagon planners must have been working hand in hand with georgian generals for months in advance nothing was left to chance
6791060 its always enjoyable to come to a new venue and im impressed it was pretty hot out there but the track is good fun and the layout is interesting i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights we had a good day the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that the afternoon was much better and the car got more and more into the set up window i hope we can keep going in this direction because it has been a productive day
6791061 that was not a particularly good day for me we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight the track is good though and i like it in karting we used to race on a lot of street circuits so learning it doesnt take long but you need to find a compromise on set up because there is a mix of slow corners and higher speed sections with long straights the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the set up right
6791062 first of all theyve done a great job with the track and its a fantastic facility to drive so thats good were not as quick as wed like to be and weve still got a bit of work to do the first session was very testing but we improved the car in the second and weve got a lot of data to go through tonight to get ourselves a good grid position tomorrow
6791063 the tracks good its a typical street circuit in that the rubbered line builds up very quickly but then off line you have much less grip you dont get on a normal track so that will make the race interesting if anyone runs wide this morning wasnt so good but we worked on the set up and made some improvements for the afternoon lets see what we can do tomorrow
6791064 it was good to finally get out on the new valencia street circuit today after previously experiencing the lap on the simulator and having a closer look during our track walk yesterday we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there the track is very dusty and if you go offline your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6791065 the new circuit here in valencia is impressive and the grip levels have been improving throughout the day so the lap times are becoming more representative we had a good morning session and i felt the car was quite well balanced but this afternoon it was almost like i had a completely different car we changed some parts for the session and unfortunately they had a real impact on the cars performance which along with some braking concerns meant that we were unable to progress im confident that we can resolve these concerns overnight and get back on the pace for qualifying tomorrow
6791066 the track is very dirty as it is so new and its very easy to lose a bit of direction as the track improves the car balance changes and the tyres behave differently
6791067 the organisers have done a fantastic job valencia is a great track it has a pretty smooth surface and its going to be a pleasure to race here we went out on new tyres fairly early on and the track ramped up a lot towards the end of the session so its difficult to really tell but i think the track is suiting our car we will have to wait and see what happens tomorrow and in the race in terms of set up we made a considerable improvement today which is good
6791068 the sessions went well for us the long runs were good but we need to find a bit more pace when were out on new tyres conditions were changing all the time and the track became easier to drive as the sessions progressed its not the easiest of circuits so im pleased i did lots of preparation work on the simulator before i arrived im feeling positive ahead of tomorrows qualifying
6791069 i did it when i was trying to make a tackle after an interception i landed on it pretty hard

6791075 in the first free practice session we concentrated on learning the new circuit the surface was still very dirty in the morning so we had to wait until the track picked up some grip in the second free practice the conditions were better although it was still quite slippery and our main focus was on tyre evaluation and basic set up work anyway the track conditions were changing every thirty minutes because of this it is quite tricky to make a prediction for tomorrow we now have to analyse the data
6791076 i really like the new valencia street circuit as they have done a very good job on the lay out of course at the start the track was extremely dirty but obviously the conditions are the same for everybody we had no technical problems and i was able to do the tyre comparison as planned im not happy with the lap times yet so now we shall look into the data and figure out how we can improve

6791100 o momento sens vel que o pa s vive em torno do sentimento de inseguran a e da inseguran a objectiva devido ao aumento de ocorr ncias relacionadas com a criminalidade organizada obriga a que a psp mantenha uma rela o de proximidade com os cidad os e a sociedade que n o se coaduna com esta participa o numa parada militar que mais parece a inten o de confundir a din mica do servi o de pol cia com o militar
6791101 imprescind vel que de uma vez por todas se defina o que se pretende da pol cia de seguran a p blica e sobretudo que n o se tentem enganar os pol cias e os demais cidad os quando se caracteriza a psp como uma for a de seguran a com cariz civilista mas que na pr tica os procedimentos e atitudes de alguns dirigentes s o diametralmente opostos a estes conceitos

6791105 there are no major technical hurdles in converting from 14 to 42v electrical systems but the business case for 42v is difficult to establish for the majority of our vehicle lines
6791106 this is important since smaller gauge wires can be used in wire harnesses resulting in a significant weight reduction
6791107 i believe it wont be until 2006 before you see any serious movement toward 42v systems and it will be driven by high end carmakers
6791108 realistically the market is out there but the transition to 42v may take longer than early prognosticators thought
6791109 it takes a long time for things to change in the automotive industry
6791110 most oems will wait to implement 42v until they see hardware but suppliers dont want to develop 42v hardware until demand and standards emerge
6791111 each side is trying to minimize its costs and risks
6791112 the thermal and packaging technologies needed to make these technologies effective can get costly
6791113 it will eventually happen but it will take some time for engineers to get the cost down
6791114 were starting to see a lot of research being done in 42v power steering systems
6791115 and electrically driven cooling systems which eliminate a mechanical water pump would benefit a vehicles fuel economy and exhaust emissions
6791116 were going back to standard applications such as a belt driven starter alternator
6791117 the electrical power consumption dictates the voltage and so far a typical u s car doesnt need the kind of electrical power that would be needed by a high end luxury european car
6791118 the r amp d investment to make 42v power semiconductors is not a huge overhead yet
6791119 the most important thing is to invest enough to make product samples available for customers to use in their experimental designs
6791120 the investment required to take these to fully released products can be made later nearer the time that real 42v applications are to be built
6791121 we may lose money the first year or two with an automotive industry product and sacrifice margins but we at least break even afterwards
6791122 we have a worldwide automotive business working with all automakers we have a group in tokyo focusing on japan and one in europe and we try to share resources and market information
6791123 the challenge with automotive systems is to provide robust voltage levels while retaining small geometries
6791124 as we move to devices with smaller geometries and higher voltages well be able to offer higher performance at lower cost
6791125 a big challenge is to agree on a bus protocol that allows 42v parts to talk to one another
6791126 i shall divorce you because you are said to be blind in one eye

6791130 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice
6791131 after extensive discussions and a frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6791132 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6791133 now its up to the icc to take a decision which they would take on sunday but i would say that south africas refusal will badly hurt the event we will still do our best to save the event and host it on schedule
6791134 we made the best security arrangements for south africa when they toured us last year and it was only at the end that they did not want to play in karachi so we relocated the match to multan
6791135 the icc has noted csas decision and will not make any further comment until the icc board meeting on sunday

6791144 soundexchange the organization that represents performers and record companies said it supports the higher royalties for internet radio because musicians deserve a bigger cut of internet radio profits
6791145 our artists and copyright owners deserve to be fairly compensated for the blood and sweat that forms the core product of these businesses
6791146 when we have our board meetings the central topic is the revenue trajectory not how happy our users are
6791147 something like the next half hour is brought to you by
6791148 net radio is good for musicians like me and i think most musicians are like me
6791149 the promotion it provides is far more important than the revenue
6791150 theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
6791151 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

6791153 im totally fine with that and so are our shareholders
6791154 clearly the market is telling us that the likelihood of a deal getting done has gone down
6791155 that is going to make the shareholder group at take two very unhappy
6791156 will enable you to understand better the value of our company to e a
6791157 enough time has passed that our economic model is obsolete

6791191 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world
6791192 factcheck representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate
6791193 we dont know about name changes parents guardians etc we also know that hawaii can issue a colb for out of state birth obama didnt grant permission to hawaii to answer all questions or release the file why did okubo say according to a recent press report that hawaii contacted the obama campaign and got no response what about releasing the files in indonesia what about the us passport files what about obama authorizing any country state school or religious institution to release all records and post them on the internet why doesnt obama answer the questions about indonesia including having a passport instead of this this is a blow off why doesnt obama authorize former harvard students to talk about him others he knew disclose who paid for harvard
6791194 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6791195 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6791196 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6791197 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6791198 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6791199 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
6791200 in fact the conspiracy would need to be even deeper than our colleagues realized in late july a researcher looking to dig up dirt on obama instead found a birth announcement that had been published in the honolulu advertiser on sunday aug 13 1961
6791201 the announcement was posted by a pro hillary clinton blogger who grudgingly concluded that obama
6791202 of course its distantly possible that obamas grandparents may have planted the announcement just in case their grandson needed to prove his u s citizenship in order to run for president someday we suggest that those who choose to go down that path should first equip themselves with a high quality tinfoil hat the evidence is clear barack obama was born in the u s a

6791208 the only way the bookmarks here would be useful for me would be to consolidate the bookmarks in one place either all in delicious or all in msdn forums
6791209 now the real question for anyone using sharepoint in their enterprise which means a lot of people is when can we have this functionality integrated to our sharepoint server
6791210 obviously we couldnt care less about yet another delicious product unless it offers something we can use in the enterprise any idea

6791220 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6791221 they have many people involved with us in many ways and theyre working hard with us to make sure we do the very best with the resources we have
6791222 were working very well together and i just think the federal government like any other partner we have wants to make sure we perform at a very high level
6791223 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people

6791238 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6791239 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6791240 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6791241 i think he was a good guy you dont always have to agree with everything somebody does to respect them
6791242 after his long career as a player he dedicated his efforts to tirelessly working to improve the salaries benefits and working conditions of generations of nfl players we talked often about common issues and i will miss those conversations
6791243 you wont find a better person in terms of taking care of former players than gene upshaw gene would do whatever is best for the players you hear all the older players who gripe and complain that we should have better this or better that they wouldnt have what they have today if not for gene upshaw
6791244 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6791245 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today
6791246 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6791247 he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten
6791248 and if thats the case doing his father and his country

6791258 this year youre probably looking at 70 to 80 percent of them that are going to be that size at least 2 inches
6791259 if we get a little bit of water in the next week or so that could change theres still time for them to put some size on
6791260 im sorry that senator obama is not here with me today i asked a long time ago for senator obama to come to come to town hall meetings with me a little bit of history barry goldwater and jack kennedy had agreed to fly around the country to hold town hall meetings all over america unfortunately the tragedy of dallas intervened but thats what its supposed to be about not the sound bites the various attack ads and all the stuff which seems to go on which i dont think inform the american people very well saturday night i had the opportunity at least to respond to the same questions that senator obama had and i think the american people have made a judgment on that
6791261 we established the democratic party right after territory days right after the civil war thats my new mexico lineage theyve been democrats elected democrats and of course as a youngster i was supporting democrats
6791262 he was a conservative blue dog southern democrat and thats how he has remained voting all of us who have democratic relatives
6791263 they are conservative as well fiscally conservative security conservative socially conservative but i flirted with it liberalism what changed me and i think also my peers here was the conservative movement epitomized in the feeling after 9 11 i think that really had an impact on our generation and i think also for liberals as well it either emboldened them or it converted them and i think it did the same with us
6791264 weve lost our focus evangelicals have alienated a lot of people who would like to vote republican but see us as extremists
6791265 were moving away from neo conservatism were moving away from evangelicalism and i think its necessary in order to be a successful party we cant be talking about abortion and gay rights all the damn time theyre gonna alienate conservative voters who dont actually want to hear any of that its about fiscal responsibility national security and i think the third most important thing is education those are the three things that the republican party is moving towards that we are focusing on bringing private components to help with public school systems has been proven in utah and nevada to be overwhelmingly successful
6791266 the 9 11 generation where national security is a huge component to our politics
6791267 its kind of a cultural thing because if youre a hispanic youre going to join the democratic party even though theyre pro choice even though theyre supporting all these ideals not necessarily tied to them hispanics rightfully should be republicans they just dont know it
6791268 were a group thats going to be fought for in the next eight years
6791269 hispanics have the opportunity to be the biggest minority component for the republican party thats the biggest place its going to start in the familia right there its the conversation within the family unit once theres young conservatives who are standing up and are hispanic then its okay to be republican we have to be a more inclusive party i concede that the republican party has not always been inclusive this group here
6791270 im going to tell them that if they want conservatives to listen to their arguments they have to present them on a conservative site as well i want a real conversation going
6791271 democrats tend to be i hate to use the word more hip and in tune with the use of technology
6791272 republicans are more traditional and dont get the information out there the same way to their constituents i think thats a definite barrier that has to be crossed as a general rule of thumb the democratic candidate here in new mexico has a flashier web site and the republicans are lacking look at our blogs on the internet but youre not going to see it change until we start it
6791273 when you have one of the founders of facebook working for obamas web site he has a slight advantage in networking
6791274 and organized outreach we dont have it were not there yet

6791277 i dont think down ballot races are going to do as well as the presidential race
6791278 why because people are realizing the old republican game plan is not working anymore i think theres going to be a disconnect in new mexico im not going to say who wins or who loses but its going to be very close youre going to have the old republicans running against a democrat in a year for change i think mccains race is distinctly separate from everything else

6791305 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application

6791350 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6791351 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6791352 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6791353 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6791354 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6791355 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6791356 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6791357 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6791358 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6791359 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
6791360 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6791361 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6791362 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6791363 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6791364 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6791365 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level
6791366 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6791367 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence to 100 percent clarify the situation and put this to rest

6791394 how could we have prevented the hostilities after russia clearly decided to start a war
6791395 of course the situation was tense before that and a lot of people had decided to leave
6791396 but no one thought that they would attack us so unexpectedly at night when everyone was asleep and when the olympic games were opening in another part of the world it was such a horrible thing they did
6791397 the georgian side has been in constant contact with the russian leadership of the peacekeepers and several hours ago they said that they had fully lost control over the actions of the separatists
6791398 i beg you we have no desire to fight with you do not try the patience of our state let us stop this escalation and start negotiations direct multilateral whatever you like
6791399 i want to appeal to those of you who are shooting at georgian policemen i want with full responsibility to say and accept that several hours ago i took a very difficult decision not to respond to fire
6791400 the evening of august 7 was relatively calm in tskhinvali
6791401 they announced the truce on the news the first shooting started at 11 30 i took my family down into the cellar and hid there too myself almost at once the electricity went off in the town it was impossible to get out until four or five in the morning because the town was being shelled with grads
6791402 according to the information we have hundreds of armed men and pieces of equipment have crossed through the roki tunnel under the russian georgian border
6791403 the georgian authorities were forces to take appropriate measures with the aim of guaranteeing the security of the peaceful population and preventing armed attacks
6791404 at around 6 am the georgian forces blew up the kurta bridge about three km north of tskhinvali a column of the russian troops that had entered the previous night from the roki tunnel was there so a couple of their vehicles were blown up as well think about how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
6791405 units of the 58th army were on a high state of readiness
6791406 that military commanders have contingency plans for any eventuality in their area is no surprise
6791407 given the relatively short distances that needed to be covered and the unusually high state of readiness of this force the speed of deployment should not be too surprising it seems clear that they were as close to the 4km roki tunnel as they could be
6791408 they were ready but im not convinced they were moving
6791409 georgian tanks entered the town in the morning we managed to beat off the first attack ourselves by midday the tanks had retreated and regrouped and around 2 pm the next attack began on the southern edges of the town
6791410 a large part of tskhinvali is now liberated and fighting is ongoing in the centre of tskhinvali
6791411 georgia did not start this confrontation and georgia will not give up its territories georgia will not say no to its freedom we have already mobilized tens of thousands of reserve troops mobilization is ongoing
6791412 there wasnt a single quiet day in august we would wake up to the sound of explosions or shots in tbilisi they say the war has started now but weve been living with war for many years
6791413 we knew hed come to hold negotiations with the ossetians
6791414 the entire village sat in front of tv sets praying that they would achieve some agreement because we knew that if they didnt there would be a war as it couldnt go on like that any longer
6791415 we both agreed to work together to get the fighting stopped in south ossetia and encourage political dialogue
6791416 it appears that the south ossetians have instigated this uptick in violence we have urged the russians to urge their south ossetian friends to pull back and show greater restraint and we believe that the russians are trying to do just that
6791417 maybe it was necessary on political grounds but not on military ones we should not have gone into tskhinvali the georgians had all the strategic heights around the town
6791418 when that became known it was easy to predict that the ossetians would jump off their chain
6791419 the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe wishes in due course to establish the grave responsibilities borne by each of the parties involved in the conflict to this end i have asked the russian and georgian governments as well as both countries parliamentary delegations for detailed information about what actually happened
6791420 if someone calls georgia a democratic country after that i dont know what to think it was the most real genocide
6791421 the situation became desperate the ossetian side was firing at georgian villages after having evacuated its children and women from the conflict zone and columns of military hardware had crossed over to georgia from russia
6791422 no one should count on seeing a split in georgia at a time like this today georgia is united against the russian occupiers
6791423 the georgian side initiated the hostilities but russia had long been lying in wait persistently trying to provoke georgia
6791424 including those staged by the peacekeepers both in south ossetia and abkhazia
6791425 the georgian authorities could and ought to have prevented the military actions
6791426 the whole world had been warning the georgian government against getting involved in and succumbing to dirty provocations especially after the recent manoeuvres by the russian armed forces in the north caucasus caucasus 2008 which simulated an invasion into georgia
6791427 at a time when barbarians are rampaging in georgia no one should give them more reasons to celebrate but later we will certainly need to settle things with the military leadership which threw the people and the army at the mercy of fate
6791428 the georgians figured it was better to ask forgiveness later but not ask for permission first
6791429 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
6791430 different tone one of defiant support for georgia in the face of russian pressure
6791431 that many in dc did not see this coming is terrible some european friends have been warning of this for months
6791432 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
6791433 wrapped up in the dispute over russias attack on georgia is a moral argument between russia and the west that will shape the future of georgias breakaway territories
6791434 it is not a dead heat but it is close

6791454 saying he wanted to kill himself doesnt make him nuts it doesnt make him crazy
6791455 its what people do when they dont want to let somebody go it doesnt surprise me at all that the mental health people let him go he wasnt crazy he was a stalker
6791456 officers who dont receive training dont know and dont understand the statute
6791457 they failed to realize this wasnt a mental health case
6791458 stalking is all about power it is all about control telling somebody if you leave me i will kill myself is the ultimate form of power and control it makes the victim feel responsibility for the other persons life
6791459 you have to ask probing questions and look at the overall picture
6791460 stalking is not a one time crime it is a pattern of behavior you a police officer may be sent to investigate a minor thing like my tire is slashed when you ask questions you may learn this has happened several times before
6791461 my husband keeps calling me and telling me hes going to kill himself im afraid to go there hes crazy i dont know whats going to happen because then i get freaked out like im going to be hurt but he does like stalk me at work

6791501 you cant help but have admiration and respect for the guy
6791502 by the time they get to the convention in st paul there might not be much of it left to use
6791503 its a head spinning non sequitur designed to distract us from something mildly troubling with the assertion of something impressive
6791504 it does seem like theyre flirting with giuliani 9 11 territory here
6791505 in which a subject that seems utterly immune to humor used as a first resort suddenly becomes a running joke among your political enemies and your late night comic friends
6791506 my taste in music was stunted when i intercepted a surface to air missile with my place
6791507 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6791508 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6791509 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6791510 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6791511 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6791512 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6791513 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6791514 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6791515 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6791516 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6791517 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6791518 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6791519 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6791520 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6791521 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6791522 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6791523 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6791524 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6791525 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6791526 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6791527 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6791528 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6791529 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6791530 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6791531 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6791532 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6791533 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6791534 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6791535 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6791536 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6791537 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6791538 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6791539 although you are insufficient to keep my holy statutes i have prepared a way for you to be made clean and holy again so that i might continue to dwell among you
6791540 you shall be grieved but your grief shall turn into joy

6791543 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6791544 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6791545 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6791546 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6791547 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6791548 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour
6791549 we shifted a match from karachi to lahore on one occasion to ensure best security for them pakistan cricket has been going out its way since 9 11 to accommodate and ensure touring teams are given state level security
6791550 the icc is trying hard to assure all teams that conditions are safe to play in pakistan and a teleconference of the executive board is to be held on sunday south africa should have waited until then
6791551 i wanna feel comfortable on the aircraft that im able to stop something if it were to start happening
6791552 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6791553 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6791554 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6791555 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

6791557 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

6791559 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6791560 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

6791564 we have not heard of naxos rights international breiners publisher which has attempted to discuss the issue with the chinese
6791565 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians
6791566 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6791567 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6791568 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6791569 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6791570 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6791571 the plan was bring them down over u s cities not over the ocean
6791572 the real focus was to blow up airliners and the people on them
6791573 it would make your hair stand up to be in the room to hear that presentation
6791574 the loss of life on the air and ground would be significant
6791575 the beauty of this channel is that you pay for only actual engagement with customers
6791576 its not like traditional media where you pay money and then hope that it reaches customers
6791577 but the problem is that people arent particularly interested or vested in responding
6791578 i certainly see the benefit for the airlines they will sell miles and get revenue for that
6791579 i dont see the merits for an advertiser since anyone who has to be paid for their opinion is a questionable customer
6791580 most people when they know they are being paid for something will complete the contract

6791587 our goal in designing cruze was to be bold not evolutionary
6791588 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world
6791589 we are proud that europe is leading the introduction for this global product
6791590 chevrolet has always stood for expressive value and cruze delivers on that promise like never before it further redefines chevrolet with its design quality materials and great style inside and out the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe and around the world
6791591 so i have this great story about a wireless transmitter that can detect submarines from 300 miles
6791592 er yeah but you know we dont write about those on techcrunch right
6791593 5 cover allows a talented filmmaker like craig to use technologies that change the way audiences consume and engage in content
6791594 rather than using all the new screens as simply additional distribution platforms we are building an entirely new interactive experience that makes connections between the audience and content more meaningful
6791595 content is now a click away and distribution platforms can fit in the palm of your hand everyone in entertainment is trying to figure out what to make for the online snacking culture and how to craft a successful business model
6791596 i think the best any filmmaker or producer can do in this new medium is embrace a frontier spirit charge in head first and celebrate what you love for me its always been memphis music and musicians and now people from around the world at any time of the day on a multitude of devices will be able to click and snack in my own backyard with some of the coolest cats this side of the mississippi river
6791597 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
6791598 this picture solves an old family mystery my great grandfather who fought on the side of great britain in the boer war often told a story
6791599 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6791600 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6791601 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6791602 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6791603 america this is our moment this is our time our time to turn the page on the policies of the past our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face our time to offer a new direction for the country we love
6791604 there will be no buffer zones we will never live with any buffer zones
6791605 we will not ask or consult with mr saakashvili about the buffer zone
6791606 everyone has the right to freedom of speech but these actions are not acceptable for someone who is representing our university
6791607 over the last several months we have had discussions with a number of financial institutions about a number of combinations including ci and its subsidiaries
6791608 were always talking to everybody we have knocked on every single door in canada theres never been a door we havent knocked on
6791609 over the last eight years or something weve done 10 acquisitions and for every acquisition that we do we kind of lose five of them
6791610 we really believe its important to take advantage of the scale that this business offers and in a business thats dominated by a few big players you want to be big and bring down your costs

6791625 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6791627 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond kabir told the australian associated press
6791628 this is a very unusual incident normally the crocodiles are very friendly and do not harm people
6791629 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6791630 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6791631 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6791632 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6791633 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6791634 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6791635 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6791636 moroccans have had their liberty and their religious freedom taken away from them it is very damaging royal air morocco obviously has absolutely no respect for islam
6791637 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6791638 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6791639 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6791640 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6791641 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6791642 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6791643 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6791644 hopefully i can progress with my career now and do well for yeovil

6791656 the bls report reflects the hard work of senior management safety managers and others at solid waste companies who have been focusing on improving the safety performance of their employees
6791657 most companies no longer believe accidents and injuries are part of doing business in this industry
6791658 although the decline in workplace fatalities is welcome there have been a number of fatalities involving municipal solid waste collectors in 2008 and there has been an increase in struck by accidents
6791659 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
6791660 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6791661 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6791666 i worked with gene for twenty five years we did hundreds of team meetings together and so well complimented each other i knew intimately how good a leader he really was how much he cared for the players and how strong and tough relentless really he was to make it right for the players we shared that vision we would do whatever it took until the last man standing
6791667 youve got a lot of older guys who are hurting and it seems like were not taking care of them but where we started when the man took the job to where we are today its unbelievable for anybody to say that this guy is not doing a great job doesnt know
6791668 my criticism of gene was that he didnt defend himself more forcibly

6791680 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6791681 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6791682 raves can cause considerable anxiety to the community and if they are not dealt with swiftly they are difficult to stop or otherwise control due often to the sheer numbers of persons involved and the safety aspects surrounding breaking up such an event
6791683 there is also little doubt that events are very well planned and organised and that local knowledge is important in drawing down the main group to a particular vulnerable field or area of land which has been targeted earlier as a suitable venue

6791688 the results were startling you can try to create rewards that encourage innovation and foster collaboration but rewards that try to do all of those things get to complicated incentives are not the best choice to engage those other drives you could use a screwdriver to open everything but it would be best to use it to open a screw
6791689 its not hierarchical you have to do all of them at once thats an important difference from other models
6791690 a poor showing on one drive diminishes the impact of high scores on the other three they cannot be ordered hierarchically or substituted one for another

6791713 he went out there and risked his neck in actual negotiations
6791714 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6791715 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6791716 theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6791717 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6791718 the question isnt how many homes mccain has but how many homes does mccain have where he got a sweetheart deal involving tony rezko

6791800 conformity is one of the nihilistic temptations of rebellion which dominate a large part of our intellectual history it demonstrates how the rebel who takes to action is tempted to succumb if he forgets his origins to the most absolute conformity and so explains the twentieth century
6791801 no i think americans have learned their lesson with vietnam and wont make that mistake again
6791802 impossible every generation since world war ii is destined to do better than their parents
6791803 i agree with mencken that americans are not the brightest inhabitants on the planet but theyre at least smart enough to know when theyre being played for saps
6791804 not possible we learned our lesson from the great depression regarding the importance of strong government regulations and oversight of the real estate and financial markets
6791805 are you kidding i just read the latest issue of popular science and by the turn of the century americans will all be riding in electric cars
6791806 nah by the turn of the century even the most conservative stiffs will wake up and realize that making drugs illegal is a huge mistake
6791807 thats ridiculous no one would do that on tv even for a lot of money
6791808 no americans are becoming more sophisticated after being deceived about vietnam and will demand much more truth and authenticity from future presidents
6791809 even with all the destruction carried out by the rice growers the supreme court decided in their favor
6791810 the farmers want the indigenous land to be divided into islands they dont want the indigenous land to be a continuous tract of land but legal experts in brazil maintain that there is no legal basis to annul the 2005 demarcation
6791811 in relation to the accusations of money coming in from venezuela and farc rebels i have no evidence for or against it
6791812 but its fair to say that whenever theres some criticism or attack to be made against social movements in brazil the farc are always dragged out although very little evidence is ever provided to prove these allegations so it seems once again that its an attempt to criminalize social movements in brazil and discredit their work in favor of the poor and the marginalized
6791813 indigenous people across the amazon have persistently complained to amnesty and denounced violations committed by soldiers who work indigenous areas sexual abuse physical abuse and intimidation
6791814 there seems to be a clear contradiction in the sense that indigenous areas are meant to limit the access into those areas to guarantee their safety and protection yet when the army goes in there time and time again we see that their rights are violated
6791815 we want to be clear on something fundamental indian lands are brazilian lands
6791816 there are no nations or indian peoples there are brazilians who are indians
6791817 this is something we see not only in the amazon but across brazil
6791818 the cultural social and economic rights of indigneous peoples tend to come into conflict with the economic interests of big agro industry and big agro industry has been the driving force of the recent economic boom thats occuring in brazil and weve seen that theres a lot of political and judicial support for their interests
6791819 when the federal authorities comply with their obligations under the constitution and under international legislation to identify and guarantee indigenous access to their ancestral lands
6791820 the challenges which come up tend to be around the economic interests of big agro industry in this case the rice farmers and time and again the indigenous peoples are losing out because vested interests tend to side with those with economic power
6791821 in this case its not that the military has allied itself with the farmers
6791822 rather two separate interests have come together this handful of farmers theyre extremely wealthy its not about them its about how brazil will use the amazon are they going to just leave it to the indians who wont develop it or does brazil have a plan for developing the amazon this is a discourse of economic development
6791823 they are saying what we do is good for the state and national economy they call themselves the nationalist resistance they consider themselves those who represent the nation against the indians who are supported by foreign interests they never say who these interests are but by conflating the local conflict into this language of nationalism and development of developing the nation they were able to get closer to the militarys cause
6791824 a decision against raposa would create the legal precedents to revoke all indigenous titles to land in brazil
6791825 any other territory could be contested like the yanomami kayap etcetera
6791826 what is on the line here is article 231 of the brazilian constitution and the indigenous rights that are layed out in that article
6791827 its not that the court decision will directly affect the constitution but the arguments that are being used go against article 231 it seems that the justice system is going to favor the big landowners and this will open up the way to revise article 231
6791828 the 1988 constitution allows indigenous people the process to set out and identify their ancestral lands
6791829 theres a real fear that this will set back cases across the country of indigenous peoples who continue to fight for the rights to their land and who through this process continue to seek the provision of their basic human rights and cultural rights
6791830 defined the rights of indigenous peoples over their lands and established that these rights enjoy over riding precedence over any subsequent rights granted to non indigenous holders
6791831 the demarcation process doesnt give indigenous people the full rights to their land but allows the land to be held by the federal government in custody for them
6791832 indigenous peoples are considered minors under brazilian law and thus do not have the right to hold the land for themselves and decide on the land for themselves
6791833 it is an issue which has been hotly contested and which many believe limit the rights of indigenous peoples to their full citizenship and full rights under international law
6791834 it would seriously undermine the whole system of indian reserves in brazil if the courts were to bow to pressure from influential landowners and politicians particularly given the violence the indians have been subjected to
6791835 mark the future of development in brazil in relation to the amazon
6791836 will we continue a predatory model of exploitation that doesnt respect the law
6791837 or will brazil be transformed definitively into a country that develops itself sustainably and respects human rights

6791847 we have been spending every day up in the little studio in our house trying to write music my favorite part so far is just seeing the guys every day and hanging out we have so much fun together the songwriting part is a bit slow on my part i think it has something to do with the baby in my belly but im sure it is all of the process and i really believe this could be the most inspired no doubt record so far cant wait to see what happens
6791848 it would be a rush if it wasnt ready i suppose but in terms of the recording we finished it in late june early july but the way media can be disseminated these days we figured if its finished then its ready to be heard i think certainly if wed decided to go the other route the cd being the first thing people heard i think we would have had to have a conversation about how we might tackle that this time around obviously the internet is such a tool for people so a lot of people dont think twice about going online to try and find music so why not use that to your advantage i suppose
6791849 we had one foot on each island as it were and in a way we were trying to remember whats been the heart of what we do
6791850 if anything with the second record there was a bit of a compromise behind it in that we were trying to marry up the two elements and not quite landing on either sort of level i suppose so why not just take it a bit further in each direction and actually follow it through a bit further
6791851 i think we just wanted to revisit some of the ways of working wed enjoyed and be a bit more choosy about where we split the various talents of those two guys and marry it up with the songs we had at that point
6791852 its a bit more disjointed in terms of the continuity it was just a different approach but im not sure if it was better or worse just a different attack and one that suited this record

6791860 50 and his attorneys met yesterday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house
6791861 the meeting had been arranged weeks ago 50 is eager to review the findings of the investigation when it is concluded
6791862 im not going through a custody battle just a transition
6791863 id like to be able to just see my baby
6791864 he said that he was going to have someone come kill me and see what he does this is what he did
6791865 i would play all these small places in new york where a lot of young musicians get their start
6791866 i would do whatever i could do to get people talking about my music a couple of years into it we could get like 300 or 400 people to show up at new york music venue s o b s but at first we were happy to get like 50 or 60 or 70 people to show up
6791867 but that whole grind is just part of how you get discovered how you develop yourself as a performer
6791868 i think it makes everything i do now more worth it because i put in all that time and all that effort
6791869 john legend is a nickname that some friends started calling me and it kind of grew into my stage name
6791870 legend is something that i never would have chosen for myself originally it grew to the point where more people in my circle would know me by that name than by my real name i had to make a decision
6791871 my bet was on me trying to live up to the name
6791872 kanye was still grinding it out when i was grinding it out
6791873 we did a show at s o b s and the crowd was definitely getting restless while he was performing
6791874 its hard to play a live show when people have no idea who you are i knew he was going to be great and was going to be a big star but at the time no one knew little did they know who he was going to be
6791875 you will not make it in this business and succeed over a long period of time unless you work really hard
6791876 i had to learn as i went when i was grinding and it does make you appreciate your success it makes you realize that its really about the work its really about making the best music you can make its really about working hard
6791877 at the end of the day theres only a few major stars in the music business and then theres all these people that are aspiring to be that
6791878 i feel like a champagne bottle that got shook up im totally excited about people hearing it because i want them to know how much i love my music theres only one way to prove it its not about being old school or new school its about being classic im not really interested in all that legend and icon its cool i mention it here and there but i really wanna make a hot joint if i never made an album before i think this album would be hot when theres pressure situations i usually deliver
6791879 i have a remix of baby with richie sambora which is a rock joint
6791880 we creatively put our heads together i told him i wanted that talk box slippery when wet by bon jovis is one of my favorite albums i thought the talk box on a couple of the songs was incredible livin on a prayer especially so i got richie to do it on the baby remix it sounds crazy then he did some vocals and he did some guitar solos so its good imma drop it out there shoot it out there and give people a chance to feel it we been talking about it having some good conversations
6791881 i thought his voice would do that song so much justice
6791882 it resonates it has that truthful energy to it that pain i wrote a song that basically its a letter to the president if i had an opportunity to have a conversation with him id pose a few questions to him in a respectful manner because i think that as a community we can get further with me asking him questions in a respectful manner than me talking crazy instead of me starting a bunch of ruckus i pose a bunch of questions that i thought were fairly intelligent to him and well see if theres a response that comes back the questions are relevant to our current president and at the same time could be posed to a president that comes in office after bush because none of the problems will be resolved theyre pretty timeless questions
6791883 dear mr president with all due respect wish we could have a conversation i would take a trip down to your residence and we would talk about the state of the nation
6791884 dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad lil mamas crying the kids are scared on 9 11 why were we unprepared

6791893 o mesmo estado que destruiu a sede tradicional reduto pol tico e cultural da juventude est agora mais de 40 anos depois reparando os danos causados e devolvendo aos estudantes aquilo que lhes foi tirado e que lhes de direito
6791894 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6791895 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6791896 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6791897 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6791907 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown away as medical trash
6791908 every infant born alive even an infant that survives an abortion procedure is considered a human being
6791909 there is no right to destroy a child that has been born alive
6791910 if a baby is born alive after a botched abortion can be thrown away as medical trash

6791913 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6791914 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6791915 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6791916 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6791917 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6791918 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6791919 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6791920 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6791921 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6791922 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6791923 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6791924 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6791925 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6791926 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6791927 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6791928 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6791929 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6791930 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6791931 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6791932 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
6791933 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
6791934 no s lo es necesaria sino esencial para su defensa
6791935 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6791936 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6791937 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6791938 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6791939 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6791940 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

6792027 consistent work to restore traditional relations in all areas of cooperation
6792028 we need to re establish positions on cuba and in other countries
6792029 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
6792030 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
6792031 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
6792032 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted
6792033 russia seeks to reassert itself as a world power which includes a renewed presence in while cuba wants to diversify its economic partners to reduce its dependence on venezuela

6792037 i will be making a submission to the court that this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances
6792038 my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice
6792039 we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6792040 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6792041 therefore i decline to make an interim order as mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6792042 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival
6792043 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into plan a proper procedure for his protection and his well being
6792044 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason because there is the possibility that for the first time he can appear before a court of justice
6792045 he tells me that his trial in vietnam a country which has been condemned by virtually every organisation concerned with justice and human rights as being a system of unfair justice and political trials that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice he never got a fair trial

6792151 today it is quite obvious who the parties in the conflict are they are the us uk israel who participated in training the georgian army ukraine who supplied it with weapons we are facing a situation where there is a nato aggression against us
6792152 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power military diplomatic information in a very disciplined way
6792153 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today
6792154 this exercise was exactly what they executed in georgia just a few weeks later
6792155 a doctor at tskhinvali regional hospital who was on duty from the afternoon of august 7 told human rights watch that between august 6 to 12 the hospital treated 273 wounded both military and civilians the doctor also said that 44 bodies had been brought to the hospital since the fighting began of both military and civilians the figure reflects only those killed in the city of tskhinvali but the doctor was adamant that the majority of people killed in the city had been brought to the hospital before being buried because the city morgue was not functioning due to the lack of electricity in the city

6792157 offered them a corridor and gave the peaceful population the chance to leave
6792158 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
6792159 not very productive because there was not a direct response to our questions about why osce has been blocked from doing its job why there has been no progress on peace initiatives from georgia from the un from the osce from other organizations
6792160 i think that the attitude there is best described by what you see by driving in tskhinvali a very large billboard with a picture of vladimir putin on it which says vladimir putin our president i do not believe that vladimir putin is now or ever should be the president of sovereign georgian soil
6792161 we agree with senator lugar that peacekeeping forces are not fulfilling the meaning of peacekeeping and they need to be replaced or changed so that they reflect a true peacekeeping mission it is time to evaluate whether the russian peacekeepers are carrying out their mission in an objective fashion i believe that a serious consideration should be given to a new force from either osce or the un which can do a job that is more credible than the present russian peacekeeping force
6792162 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power military diplomatic information in a very disciplined way

6792166 something that if i didnt do id definitely regret it

6792168 a lot of our stuff is going to be represented
6792169 i just didnt deal directly with ted turner or anything like that
6792170 with saddam hussein we dont know exactly what he has
6792171 its exactly like the civil war its a waiting game you dont know what his capability is and if he has weapons
6792172 i want to wake up every single day in the white house thinking about you and about how i can make your lives just a little bit better
6792173 because if your president doesnt hear whats going on in your life and doesnt see whats going on in your life then that president is not going to be fighting for you and thats what you need
6792174 i was raised to believe the american dream was built on rewarding hard work but we have seen the folks of washington turn the american ethic on its head
6792175 thats the essence of the american dream and people feel like its slipping away
6792176 for the past seven years so many people in this country have felt invisible like your president didnt even really see you
6792177 ive been fighting for you my whole adult life and i will keep standing for you and working for you every single day
6792178 michael phelps is great but you cant take swimming all that seriously

6792181 seinfeld does represent sort of a challenge hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person

6792185 this wonderful restaurant imho is the best place to close a deal
6792186 the palace hotel in gstaad switzerland is the best skiing resort i
6792187 the best resort for a honeymoon and where we went is the
6792188 and those that didnt have cars didnt want to ride wolfline out there
6792189 all our other home games were like 2 oclock or 4 oclock in the afternoon which was not good for us
6792190 one it was the hottest time of the day and two kids were still in class
6792191 yeah i think so too so we have a new word in our vocabulary now
6792192 charlie chaplin could do a better job of running the home office than this labour government
6792193 the home office is entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6792194 one of the possible consequences is that criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6792195 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies that are meant to do research for you then you need to be absolutely certain that when you give such information away the company concerned have put into practice procedures that are just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed since the loss of the child benefit data
6792196 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses more personal information has been reported lost it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
6792197 the home office has informed us that an internal report will be carried out into the data security arrangements between the home office and its contractor pa consulting
6792198 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6792199 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6792200 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6792201 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6792202 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis
6792203 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison

6792206 people feel like the detroit 3 dug this hole and theyve got to get themselves out
6792207 as far as im concerned quentin has been the american league mvp
6792208 hes had a pretty good year and if we win this thing hes got a good chance
6792209 obviously you dream to do something like that in your career
6792210 you want to set a goal to be the best something like that is far from my mind i hear it mentioned once in awhile but i kind of laugh and push it off to the side
6792211 i say whats on my mind i just have things that i have to do i have a job and its playing major league baseball its my first and foremost priority
6792212 hes just got his own way and the only thing im looking from him is to go out there and continue to hit the way hes hitting
6792213 this is what i do this is baseball you prepare yourself for what you are going to experience im not going to be frightened by anything
6792214 theres no doubt that alexei should be part of the conversation with rookie of the year
6792215 most of the time when you say oh god we face josh beckett in two weeks i guarantee you a lot of the people dont sleep
6792216 ramirez doesnt care how hard he throws he just goes out there and swings the bat
6792217 im happy just to get here and get a medal but im not happy because i practised with 11 guys i trained with 11 guys i got to know 11 guys for a whole year and my expectations were all of us to medal
6792218 so for me just to get a medal is a good thing but at the same time im not happy because im not the kind of guy who likes to shine in the light
6792219 i didnt come here by myself i was looking forward to having guys celebrate with me
6792220 in the future youre going to see greatness of me youre looking at the future heavyweight champion of the world mark my words
6792221 im not mohammad ali im not going to predict youll just have to wait and see baby when it happens it happens and i just want you to remember i told you that
6792222 money cannot make a person happy what makes me happy is setting goals for myself and seeing myself succeed and get to those goals
6792223 the whole world knows who im doing it for ive got her name tattooed on my heart so every time i take my clothes off put on this usa uniform this armour right here i know who im doing it for
6792224 i cant wait to see her when this is over and she cant wait to see daddy
6792225 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
6792226 its something we had counselled them on in the past two years to be careful of
6792227 some of the photos were somewhat distasteful and we thought it was best that they took a bit more care
6792228 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6792229 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6792230 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6792231 anyone that barack obama wants is my choice for vice president but i do think that in the list of considerations there should be somebody from the house of representatives and chet edwards is a person that many of us think would be a good person to have in the mix
6792232 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions

6792277 the predominant verbal reaction to failed humor in our study was oriented exclusively toward attacking the speaker

6792290 what have you done with ingmar bergman and who have you put in his place
6792291 my theater career was very undeveloped and actually ingmar bergman had written about me saying i was tragic not for the work that we did together but for not doing classical work in relation to my natural gifts and he published this in an article called shakespeare ibsen strindberg and oneil and i was quite flattered
6792292 i feel ashamed of or detest only a few of my films for various reasons this cant happen here was the first one i completed it accompanied by violent inner opposition the other is the touch both mark the very bottom for me
6792293 ive finished the screenplay although not without a fair amount of inner resistance i baptized it the touch as good a name as any other now im going to take time off until august 3 when we begin the preparations in earnest i feel depressed and ill at ease id be happy to drop this film
6792294 the intention was to shoot the touch in both english and swedish in an original version that doesnt seem to exist anymore english was spoken by those who were english speaking and swedish by those who were swedes i believe that it possibly was slightly less unbearable than the totally english language version which was made at the request of the americans
6792295 i felt i needed a loyal friend in this foreign production besides bibi has a good command of english the fact that she became pregnant after having accepted the part threw a terrible monkey wrench into what seemed on the surface at least a matter of fact methodical production set cries and whispers began to make its way forward during this depressing period
6792296 thats not true i kind of appreciated the voice article the writer had a take about my being jewish and how likely it was for me to breakthrough in film no i had seen several of his films

6792325 this created an artificial situation where livestock producers were essentially being subsidized by the government and there was a lot of abuse of the program by feed millers
6792326 the government has been discussing turning barley imports over to the private sectors for years because the current system was becoming increasing inefficient
6792327 in the best case situation corn imports have the potential to double from 650 000 metric tons 25 6 million bushels to 1 3 million tons 51 1 million bushels he said
6792328 local traders are more realistic and projecting that corn imports will grow significantly in the first year but the complete transition from barley to corn sorghum or co products will take a few years as traditional livestock producers adjust their formulas to the new prices realistically you will likely see tunisias corn sorghum and co products imports increase by 200 000 to 300 000 metric tons and most will likely go to corn
6792329 as we go forward all grains will now compete on an equal basis rather a preferential governmental program creating a much more dynamic livestock industry in tunisia
6792330 we are working to increase the presence of ddgs in swine feed rations right now most taiwanese hog farmers are only including 3 to 7 percent ddgs in their feeder pig rations our intent is to increase that inclusion rate to 20 percent
6792331 we also want to see hog farmers begin incorporating ddgs in sow rations which is not currently happening at most operations
6792332 there is a lot of false information being disseminated in taiwan about the presence of mycotoxins in u s ddgs a lot of this misinformation is coming from additive companies trying to steer end users away from ddgs in order to sell their own feed additives
6792333 the fact of the matter is ddgs coming from the u s contain very little to no mycotoxins we are trying to get the truth out there
6792334 the councils staff and consultants in taiwan forecast the potential market for ddgs in taiwan to be about 700 000 metric tons per year
6792335 this not only includes about 600 000 tons for the swine industry but also 100 000 tons for dairy poultry and aquaculture annually

6792381 pasangan seharusnya tidak melupakan bahwa persetubuhan bukan satunya cara untuk berhubungan seksual
6792382 jika tidak ada masalah masalah dalam kehamilan tidak ada alasan sama sekalai bagi pasangan pasangan untuk tidak berhubungan seksual bahkan hingga akhir semester ketiga
6792383 bagaimanapun kehamilan bukan penyakit itu suatu peristiwa normal dan tidak ada bukti bahwa persetubuh dapat membahayakan si janin
6792384 namun jika sebuah pasangan sama sama monogami dan keduanya bebas dari penyakit sama sekali tidak ada alasan untuk khawatir
6792385 jika si ibu tidak menjalani episiotomi operasi pelebaran vagina atau operasi cesar tidak masalah untuk memulai aktivitas seksual sesegera mungkin setelah melahirkan meskipun akan terdapat sejumlah cairan vagina yang keluar selama kurang lebih 1 minggu hal tersebut sangat bervariasi dan hal tersebut sangat tergantung kepada pasangan untuk memutuskan
6792386 jika terjadi operasi cesar wanita bisa berhubungan seksual kembali dalam waktu satu atau dua minggu secara teoritis episiotomi akan sembuh dalam waktu tiga minggu namun saya mendapati bahwa wanita masih merasa sakit saat berhubungan seksual setelah empat bulan
6792387 namun jika pasangan dapat meluangkan tempat bagi seks di kehidupan mereka jika mereka berusaha keras untuk meluangkan waktu untuk berdua saja pada saat mereka tidak lelah tegang dan tidak nyaman maka masalah masalah tersebut akan dapat terselesaikan
6792388 banyak pasangan yang merasa risih melakukan masturbasi namun mereka perlu membujuk diri mereka sendiri untuk melakukannya

6792411 the issue is not whether or not they can detect cancer because clearly they can the issue is whether you can set up a system whereby they can communicate with you that requires further ingenuity

6792429 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6792430 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6792431 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6792432 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6792433 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6792434 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6792435 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6792436 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6792437 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6792438 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6792439 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal

6792451 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6792452 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6792453 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6792454 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6792455 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6792456 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6792457 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6792458 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6792459 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6792460 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6792461 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6792462 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6792463 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6792464 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6792465 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6792466 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6792467 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6792468 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6792469 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6792470 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6792471 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6792472 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6792473 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6792474 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6792475 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6792476 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6792477 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6792478 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6792479 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6792480 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6792481 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6792482 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6792483 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6792484 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6792485 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6792486 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6792487 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6792488 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6792489 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6792490 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6792491 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6792492 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

6792494 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6792495 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6792496 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6792497 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6792498 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6792499 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6792500 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings

6792508 general perkins also noted that american and iraqi officials had tentatively agreed to a plan to hopefully transfer 58 000 american paid militia guards this year onto iraqi government payrolls under the command of the baghdad operation center which reports to prime minister nuri kamal al maliki
6792509 and while american officials are insistent that the program to pay militia guards continue to operate general perkins said it was

6792511 this is a planning took where all things are going
6792512 this is the first program of its kind to inspire shoppers diners and commuters to use 1 coins in their normal everyday activities
6792513 when each of us spends the 1 coin we make a difference for our country because the 1 coin is durable and using it saves the nation money we hope our pilot cities lead the change
6792514 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6792515 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6792516 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6792517 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6792518 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6792519 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

6792598 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

6792614 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
6792615 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

6792621 the aclus lawsuit is nothing but a first step toward setting up polling places in prisons and jails our state cannot allow that to happen
6792622 how could such widespread mistakes occur the short answer is that confusion over voting laws has long vexed citizens and state officials alike
6792623 we have a shameful history of voter disfranchisement and conflicting statements from the attorney general and the legislature havent helped
6792624 now termination of voting rights occurs only for felonies involving moral turpitude an antiquated term that is not defined in the constitution it is absurd to require citizens who have never been deemed by the legislature to be disfranchised in the first place to go through this process to exercise a right they never legally lost
6792625 had i known it probably would have made a different effect on the plea bargain i took

6792644 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6792645 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6792646 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6792647 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6792648 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic
6792649 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
6792650 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
6792651 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
6792652 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
6792653 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body

6792668 its such a text that you cant change it i have certain suggestions or certain interpretations i have been keeping the play intact and i have been breaking the play at several places besides this i have been adding my own ideas into it the play is intact but its not a play nor is it a transitional play it is a pure film i have been throwing all these scenes on it through vast locations
6792669 i think they wanted the producers of this film the sort of sensibility which i had in the films titanic and shall we dance the sorts of scoring that i was doing in those movies which people are familiar in here in india so i think it wont be as big shock as some people thought it will be but yes it has a different approach
6792670 my association with three ladies actress in the film is very strange in the film this character mohanlals character in the film has got very strange ideas because he loves to make things very big he is renowned architect so its a passion and its a creation so this man lives in a different plane so he reacts with these ladies in different planes

6792673 the requirements outlined in the proposed regulation will give pregnant and nursing women and their clinicians important and detailed information that will improve treatment decisions and health care outcomes
6792674 beyond labeling of current know risks we need more research to understand how medical treatments affect pregnant women and their children
6792675 these groups have not been adequately studied in the past so we cant conclude that research on medication use in the general population will apply to them this is an important point that holds true for all medical research
6792676 we know there are substantial differences between women and men and among different racial and ethnic groups in health and disease including responses to treatments research studies must be designed and analyzed with a focus on group differences if scientists dont ask questions about how women children minorities or the elderly might be affected differently and publish the results our understanding of population differences will never grow and well struggle to close gaps in health outcomes for these groups
6792677 we welcome the overdue release of our colleague but remain troubled that open ended detentions of iraqi journalists by the u s military are continuing
6792678 the journalist is continuing to be held as an investigation into his being a security risk is evaluated when the investigation is complete the journalist will be charged or released
6792679 the u s military continues to flout basic due process norms and hinder the work of local journalists
6792680 u s forces should either charge or free raziak immediately
6792681 rescheduling is a problem because of the tight international calendar involving all teams and every board is aware of this and we have been preparing very hard to make the champions trophy a safe and successful event
6792682 south africas decision is all the more disappointing for us because they came to pakistan last year and were satisfied with the level of security we provided them on the tour
6792683 we shifted a match from karachi to lahore on one occasion to ensure best security for them pakistan cricket has been going out its way since 9 11 to accommodate and ensure touring teams are given state level security
6792684 the icc is trying hard to assure all teams that conditions are safe to play in pakistan and a teleconference of the executive board is to be held on sunday south africa should have waited until then
6792685 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6792686 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6792688 decentralised management of the protected areas in the leopard habitat made it impossible to implement a unified program for leopard restoration over many years
6792689 moreover protection of red list species which includes the far eastern leopards did not fall under the remit of any of the other agencies
6792690 this announcement marks the culmination of five years of hard work by wwf
6792691 this is a real opportunity for the leopard population in the region to gain a foothold and pull themselves up from the brink of extinction
6792692 any construction in the region should take into consideration the fragile state of this leopard population
6792693 activities undertaken should in no way threaten the existence of the species
6792694 this research is particularly interesting because we have identified a potentially ancient process
6792695 mono lake is often considered an analog for early earth environments which means that conditions for this type of photosynthesis may have existed during the archean eon more than 2 5 billion years ago

6792697 the kids zone launched on the 92nd anniversary of the national park service introduces the next generation of park stewards to the fascinating stories told in national parks
6792698 the website will enable young people to actively explore parks without leaving home but hopefully will also inspire them to visit these special places in person

6792701 it was devastated bare and windswept it was basically neglect in the 1990s the farmers had no capital nothing to buy anything with ethiopia had the lowest per capita use of chemical fertiliser in the world
6792702 all the families have benefited from the rehabilitation by becoming food secure for at least 12 months
6792703 we need action to tackle the immediate food crisis in africa and the long term impact that climate change will have on food supplies and agriculture across the continent
6792704 with global challenges such as climate change energy and food security understanding maintaining and restoring dryland ecosystem services will be critical
6792705 drylands are areas characterized by a highly seasonal unpredictable rainfall water scarcity and a hot climate most development interventions have failed to take this into consideration resulting in unsustainable land management and degradation of critical resources such as water vegetation cover and soil fertility
6792706 improvement of livelihoods the enhancement of environmental services the conservation of natural resources and biodiversity and the contribution of agriculture to the maintenance of social and cultural traditions
6792707 science and technology should be targeted towards raising yields but also protecting soils water and forests
6792708 i dont think that adi nifas is unique its success shows what all small communities can do if they get together and decide to protect their environment and support each other the situation in much larger areas could be quickly and radically improved

6792712 this resolution would highlight the need for more attention and resources to be focused on how violence toward animals is indicative of other violent tendencies by investigating the link further information could be gathered that will help mitigate societal violence
6792713 the link is typically addressed at the state and local levels the fact that key congressional leaders are now committing themselves to addressing the link is a promising step toward future action and increased exposure for the issue
6792714 as americas leader on the link between animal cruelty and interpersonal violence american humane enthusiastically embraces congress interest and looks forward to further collaboration on this issue
6792715 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6792716 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6792717 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6792719 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president

6792721 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6792740 there was an enormous amount of hope after the anjouan assault
6792741 the truth is that the situation is maybe even worse today and that there is a general malaise across the country the situation is severe and we fear that if it persists it could bring the country back to political instability we fear social unrest
6792742 everything is affected transport electricity and food food has become so expensive that nobody can afford to buy anything we are in a situation of permanent crisis here people are really angry and disappointed
6792743 street demonstrations protesting the lack of fuel have occurred in moroni the comoran capital situated on grand comore island and on the island of anjouan
6792744 evolution over the last decade has been thrilling especially given the economic challenges faced by independent artists that the honorary awards committee has had so many qualified applicants to choose from for four straight years suggests the community is strengthening and asserting its rightful place as one of the industrys premier laboratories the place where some of the most dynamic work can be found

6792748 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6792749 conservation networks try to protect as much biodiversity as possible
6792750 according to our findings the first priority should be to save the biodiversity were rapidly losing but simply focusing on the current most threatened species might not always be the best approach
6792751 they have a slow reproductive rate and theyre restricted to particular geographic areas pandas also are prone to extinction for the same reasons
6792752 were also looking at a regional approach to focus on intact ecosystems as well as those that require regeneration
6792753 it will cost less to focus on species that are doing well but are vulnerable in the future think of it as a healthcare system with some species on life support and other healthier species needing a vaccination to keep them thriving
6792754 areas are limited in the number of species they can contain and no one knows how that will be affected by climate change
6792755 scientists dont have a past record from which they can project forward its very difficult to predict which species will survive when we dont know what the future climates will be
6792756 with climate change were generating a new mass extinction event
6792757 but we have a choice of what our environment will be were at a point of having to make crucial decisions
6792758 eso toca dejarlo muy claro ten amos una preocupaci n la semana pasada y conversamos con los congresistas ponentes de un importante proyecto que es el de ciencia y tecnolog a

6792780 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in

6792798 el procedimiento es que el centro de control aeroportuario tiene que llamar al 112 y decirle activo el plan de emergencias entonces el jefe de sala del 112 es el que tiene que movilizar servicios de acuerdo con el protocolo es decir polic a guardia civil summa samur protecci n civil bomberos pero el que tiene que dar el pistoletazo de salida es el aeropuerto lo que s les adelanto es que aunque todav a no tenemos todos los datos el plan del 112 se activ por llamadas de particulares que fueron muchas
6792799 no eso quiere decir lo que he dicho cuando est toda la secuencia de llamadas podremos determinar en qu momento desde el punto de vista t cnico real podemos entender que barajas ha activado el plan
6792800 sin esperar nada m s y como consecuencia de las llamadas de particulares

6792821 this is a very interesting track and quite different to a typical street circuit with the fact there are some run off areas it is lots of fun to drive and technically demanding while it might look a bit like canada its actually completely different the corners are tricky and it took some time to find the right line we started the day with poor conditions and very low grip because it was very dusty but it improved during the day now it will be interesting to analyse what we have done and see what the others did i think we can be well prepared for tomorrow
6792822 the track is quite nice and i think they have done a good job with the design at their first attempt of course the grip level will come up over the weekend because by the end of the day the grip on the racing line was good but as soon as you put a wheel off line it was very difficult the car is not too bad although i am still struggling a little bit with rear end instability on corner entry and have some traction issues so we still need to fine tune the balance for tomorrow apart from the beginning of the morning when the tyres wore quickly because of wheelspin and the fact the car was sliding a lot the tyres seem to be holding up quite well now the track conditions have stabilised lets see what happens when we go to the next step tomorrow afternoon and empty the fuel tank

6792844 concerns about slowing demand for crude oil and re ned products both in the u s and overseas have many investors worried but investors in the equipment and services group should not panic
6792845 most producers continue to spend aggressively and u s crude oil inventories remain well below the average for this time of year with fewer than 20 days of supply in storage

6792853 severstal resources believes that the high demand for primary raw materials for steel production including coking coal and iron ore will continue due to the strong industrial fundamentals in global metals and mining
6792854 to keep pace with the global growth of the steel industry our mining business is capitalizing on the opportunity to expand into a new geographic market gain access to export markets and diversify its mining technologies our significant experience with coal mining in russia leaves us well positioned to make the most of our acquisition of pbs ensuring its continued growth by providing additional management and operational expertise
6792855 securing the supply of raw materials is a critical piece to maximizing the full potential of our u s business
6792856 the acquisition of pbs will help ensure that severstal controls its operating costs by providing a guaranteed supply of metallurgical coal for our coke making operations in the u s the integration of our upstream production from coal and coke making to steel making will allow us to sustain profitability and return value to shareholders

6792868 coming off of his rookie season and his selection to the u s olympic and national teams maurice has garnered a great deal of attention from other clubs around the world in the end we believe the decision to transfer maurice is in the best interest of his development as a player and toronto fc
6792869 he has made tremendous contributions to establishing our club on the pitch and in the community maurice will always be part of toronto fcs history
6792870 i will miss toronto and the teams amazing supporters and fans toronto fc will always have special meaning for me because its the club that gave me my professional start

6792884 its unfortunate that before an organization can exercise its first amendment right to speak out on an issue it must first seek an injunction in federal court

6792886 catholic voters continue to support republican john mccain over democrat barack obama in the presidential race
6792887 mccain leads by nine percentage points in our two person head to head polling but there is still a significant slice who are yet undecided
6792888 catholic voters tell us they are more likely to be concerned about international issues than the average american voter and they also care more about social issues particularly abortion
6792889 mccains strength among catholic voters comes as russian troops moved into the republic of georgia and as he put in a strong straightforward performance at the saddleback civil forum in california
6792890 in that forum there was a clear distinction between mccain and obama on the question of when a human life begins and catholic voters may be responding warmly to mccains defense of his pro life stance at that forum

6792897 bishop li shans interview can be considered as one of the signs with which the chinese side responds to the willingness and desire expressed by the pope in his letter from a year ago addressed to chinese catholics to seek a normalization of relations between china and the holy see

6792907 there is huge waste and loss of water through food that is produced since roughly 50 percent of the food that farmers grow is lost or wasted
6792908 there is a need for a mentality shift it would make a lot of sense for people to waste less
6792909 that corresponds to 40 trillion litres of irrigation water enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
6792910 in many areas of the world you simply cannot store food efficiently because it is not handled well
6792911 in urban settings we have lost touch with realities people do not know where food comes from they do not know what it takes to produce food
6792912 now if you throw away half of that kilo that means youve thrown away 7 5 tonnes of water
6792913 unless we change our practices water will be a key constraint to food production in the future
6792914 gone down by 30 percent because the price went up
6792915 we pay a price here for water that is not very high but we also couple that with education and awareness so people know there is a cost to the environment to use that water

6792922 no one from the tournament staff notified us about the incident last spring which is a surprise given the scope of what happened
6792923 everyone has the right to freedom of speech but these actions are not acceptable for someone who is representing our university
6792924 professor shanahans conduct falls below the standard established to protect our university its faculty students and alumni as a representative of fhsu he had a duty of care that was seriously breached by his behavior
6792925 if the coach of one of our athletic teams became angry and mooned officials student athletes and fans during a sports event he or she would no longer be a coach at fort hays state university
6792926 standards for our debate program are certainly just as high
6792927 we are an institute of higher learning and this incident provides a valuable teaching moment
6792928 our society has become increasingly confrontational and uncivil our investigation revealed that those ills have also infected college debate we have a responsibility not only to deal with the specific incident but to stand up against this decline in the standards of college debate
6792929 i place high value on college debate as an exceptional learning opportunity however i had no idea that college debate had degenerated into the kind of displays that we witnessed when we watched ceda events on the internet college debate has changed greatly the lack of decorum and the lack of civility are not compatible with the educational standards at fhsu and i doubt they are compatible with the educational standards at most universities
6792930 if anyone doubts my conclusion that person should view the entire debate which was laced with four letter words a lack of personal respect and a lack of civil discourse
6792931 but the kind of debate being used today in much of college debate falls short of our educational standards
6792932 he led our debate team of joe ramsey and jason regnier to the cross examination debate association national championship in april 2002 in california he also has been a provocative teacher who allowed even encouraged dissenting opinions from students in his classroom
6792933 he was highly esteemed by his students and his debaters furthermore while he and i do not share the same opinion about the standards that should guide college debate there is no one who is more dedicated to college debate than bill shanahan also while he clearly reacted in an inappropriate manner i understand why mr shanahan was outraged by the not so veiled accusations of racism during his 10 years at fhsu i have known bill to be a fervent champion of the underdog and racial equality
6792934 our provost dr larry gould launched an investigation of the incident just as soon as we heard about the video on the internet no matter how compelling the video was we believed bill shanahan had a right to tell his side of the story the public outcry was understandable and we took seriously those who spoke both for and against dr shanahan but ultimately we made our decision based on the full set of facts that we gathered in our investigation i would also point out that some of the media reports contained glaring inaccuracies about facts such as where the debate had taken place and details about professor shanahans employment at fhsu we were not about to let a rush to judgment cause us to make decisions based on faulty information i make no apology for the careful deliberate manner in which we considered what should be done
6792935 i greatly appreciate the strong support i have received from fhsu over the last 10 years in the fullest tradition of academic freedom and the outpouring of support and concern expressed by countless colleagues students and former students
6792936 i am terribly sorry that my actions reflected poorly on the university
6792937 however they must be judged in the unique context of college debate marked by its passion and rigorous intellectual engagement
6792938 i hope this incident does not detract from the incredible work done by fort hays state debate over the last decade or my other contributions to fhsu which are far greater than a 9 minute youtube clip

6792962 i see a reticence to fully invest in this campaign barbaro says
6792963 i see it by many former hillary devotees and i see it when i raise money for barack on the campaign hustings as i go around the county

6793104 largely the product of sectarian violence rampant criminal activity and home grown insurgency and therefore grossly distort the global terrorism picture
6793105 it makes no sense to count civilian casualties in a war zone as deaths caused by terrorism mr zakaria wrote since the mid 1990s thousands of civilians have been killed in war zones in other countries around the world and those victims werent counted as casualties related to terrorism

6793213 this tatas withdrawing will create problems for the state not only in the present but also for future in attracting investment
6793214 committed to bring investment into a state which had attracted little investor attention
6793215 small car is a world story it is an issue of countrys image
6793216 irreversibly hamper the future industrialisation of the state and could take it back to an age of industrial vacuum
6793217 back to the 1970s when the state witnessed large exodus of industry
6793218 we would have to make a move despite whatever investments had been already made in the project
6793219 i am confident we can improve because like i said before we are working together so maybe we can improve a little bit
6793220 we know we can improve but we have players in the olympic games and players returning late maybe the game wasnt the best but we can improve clearly
6793221 yes when you bring in new players they will need time
6793222 keane is very clever so i think it will be easier when we signed peter crouch he went 14 games without scoring and i think with keane he has experience and quality too i am not worried about this because if he is playing well i will be really pleased and if andrea dossena scores the winning goal i will be just as pleased
6793223 again it is too early but clearly we are working trying to improve so we will see
6793224 the most important thing for me before i came to the premier league was that i knew that the coach really wanted me
6793225 once they had sorted everything between the clubs then i met the coach you can never judge a person too soon but my first impressions were that i loved the dynamic i love the confidence you feel from him hughes and the ambitious type of character that he is will make you a better player
6793226 im someone who likes to learn a lot and work hard to improve so no matter what happens ill be improving all the time and increasing my level im looking forward to it im very happy now
6793227 i know much about the premier league in general but i couldnt make a guess at the level of the team but i just know there is ambition
6793228 the future of the club is what it is all about and im sure we have a good team but im sure we are going to have an even better team in the coming months and years
6793229 hes our player and hes played exceptionally well in the last couple of games for us
6793230 personally speaking thats the most important thing for aston villa and our supporters
6793231 were delighted with his commitment and we would be delighted if he stayed
6793232 i have nothing to say on that not a thing
6793233 we would be absolutely delighted if he stayed and i think that has been our stance the whole way through
6793234 were going to try and get some more in because we need to strengthen
6793235 weve taken a few players on but shauns gone now and we still want a few more in well be working vigorously towards that end
6793236 i would say the federal government has the same view on this as we do
6793237 we want to do a stunning job of staging great ceremonies at bc place in 2010 we need to represent the interests of the country in the most beautiful poignant and emotional way
6793238 we want to tell a great story and thats who we are and i think thats what they expect of us
6793239 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6793240 they have many people involved with us in many ways and theyre working hard with us to make sure we do the very best with the resources we have
6793241 were working very well together and i just think the federal government like any other partner we have wants to make sure we perform at a very high level
6793242 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people
6793243 que exacerbe a n m s los nimos de un pa s que se viene polarizando
6793244 es peligroso levantar los nimos de una poblaci n amaz nica ind gena que tienen una profunda relaci n umbilical con la tierra tratar de hacerlo unilateralmente sin consultarlo es romper esa relaci n que ellos tienen es meterle un sablazo con la soberbia y el autoritarismo
6793245 por eso le pido que el congreso como dem crata y ex presidente le pido que derogue esos decretos para evitar cualquier confrontaci n que exacerbe a n m s los nimos de un pa s que se viene polarizando

6793248 everyone knows that rule number one for any job is showing up no private company would put up with its employees refusing to show up for work let alone watch the problem grow year after year these findings are an insult to the american taxpayer and should be of great concern to the agencies included and members of congress
6793249 it is inexcusable that federal agencies would sit by and let this problem get worse while some agencies are completely unaware that there even is a problem before agencies come hat in hand to congress asking for money to hire more employees they should fully use the ones they already have by getting the awol problem under control awol employees put a hidden tax on the american taxpayer by making the federal government more inefficient with the resources it has been given
6793250 mrslns expertise is critical to the success of the demonstration reactor project while the licencing and environmental impact assessment process for the demonstration power plant still need to be successfully completed the signing of the epcm contract represents a significant milestone for pbmr

6793267 ser a necesario un conjunto de pol ticas p blicas que claramente el gobierno solo este gobierno el gobierno anterior ser a incapaz de tomar

6793270 sin ese mecanismo va a ser muy dif cil que consigamos evitar procesos de cambios dr sticos en la vegetaci n amaz nica

6793316 as on so many issues obama risks losing the far left of his party if he moderates his own out of the mainstream positions in order to win more centrist voters instead hell probably continue to talk out of both sides of his mouth on the issue and hope catholic voters dont notice

6793403 over the past two years we conducted our most extensive consumer research ever
6793404 our purpose in interviewing 1 400 travelers nationally was twofold better understand traveler behavior and then establish where we must be to meet their needs from the moment they begin exploring where to go right through the time they return home and begin sharing their individual experiences
6793405 while we always believed we were meeting our customers fundamental needs we determined that we had only been capturing a slim portion of the travelers overall experience cycle
6793406 luxury travel and travel experiences have been able to weather the economy better than others
6793407 the idea of buying products and goods is no longer satisfying

6793420 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6793421 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

6793488 karena kalau pemda tidak jelas hal itu akan berpengaruh pada pembagian dana alokasi umum nantinya akan lebih kecil dan ini kan merugikan daerah juga maka sebelum melepas daerah otonom diperlukan tatacara dan pertimbangan yang cermat

6793491 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think that the economy was fundamentally strong
6793492 but if you are like me and have one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6793501 with this way customers can choose the bonus pack that fits the task and deploy and train on individual features instead of having to go through a whole upgrade
6793502 now customers dont have to wait for a large release in order to get performance tuning
6793503 by virtue of engaging in a subscription theyll have access to updates sooner than the rest of the world
6793504 this is critical for all cad managers to help keep their workflow on track

6793648 were delighted with his commitment and we would be delighted if he stayed
6793649 i have nothing to say on that not a thing
6793650 we would be absolutely delighted if he stayed and i think that has been our stance the whole way through
6793651 were going to try and get some more in because we need to strengthen
6793652 weve taken a few players on but shauns gone now and we still want a few more in well be working vigorously towards that end

6793661 yes when you bring in new players they will need time
6793662 keane is very clever so i think it will be easier when we signed peter crouch he went 14 games without scoring and i think with keane he has experience and quality too i am not worried about this because if he is playing well i will be really pleased and if andrea dossena scores the winning goal i will be just as pleased
6793663 again it is too early but clearly we are working trying to improve so we will see

6793671 once they had sorted everything between the clubs then i met the coach you can never judge a person too soon but my first impressions were that i loved the dynamic i love the confidence you feel from him hughes and the ambitious type of character that he is will make you a better player
6793672 im someone who likes to learn a lot and work hard to improve so no matter what happens ill be improving all the time and increasing my level im looking forward to it im very happy now
6793673 i know much about the premier league in general but i couldnt make a guess at the level of the team but i just know there is ambition

6793680 we may want to vote for a particular facility but the law requires us to vote for another or we may want to vote for a particular casino but the law requires us to send it back for more negotiations
6793681 its no longer an issue we solved it in a different way
6793682 i dont place much credence in the southern strategy its probably overstated as presented
6793683 the forthcoming release of disgaea 3 marks square enixs commitment to delivering memorable titles to new audiences nippon ichi has created a wonderful world full of bizarre characters and deep addictive gameplay i am delighted that we have added disgaea 3 to our growing 2009 line up and i hope everyone enjoys playing this unique and rewarding game
6793684 we are encouraged by our results and our continued market share gains but the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent
6793685 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6793686 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6793687 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6793688 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6793689 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6793690 beh certo giovanni non ha mai chiamato i magistrati avvocati dellaccusa e poi occorre delicatezza quando si richiamano le idee di chi non c pi e non pu controbattere
6793691 if you noticed all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up leaving behind the plain and cheap ones while it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves that is the source of your problems and stress
6793692 be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases its just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink what all of you really wanted was coffee not the cup but you consciously went for the best cups amp and then began eyeing each others cups
6793693 now consider this life is the coffee the jobs houses cars things money and position in society are the cups they are just used to hold and contain life the type of cup we have does not define nor change the quality of life we live sometimes by concentrating only on the cup we fail to enjoy the coffee god has provided us
6793694 being happy doesnt mean everythings perfect it means youve decided to see beyond the imperfections

6793696 but we have many many people who want to be in the east village not so much the financial district
6793697 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6793698 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6793699 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6793700 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample
6793701 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6793702 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6793703 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6793704 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6793705 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6793706 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6793707 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6793708 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6793709 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6793710 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6793711 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6793712 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6793713 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6793714 we dont need a law for everything a driver does the next one is going to be you cant drive while you are eating a hamburger
6793715 i said to him youre a goddamn sick motherf er dont ever come by my house again
6793716 i stopped because i was almost going to kill him
6793717 i shouldnt have done it i should have called the cops i was just so mad that he tried that to my daughter
6793718 i dont really care because i did what i had to do i dont have a husband to help me
6793719 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6793720 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6793721 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6793722 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6793723 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6793724 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6793725 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6793726 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6793727 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6793728 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6793729 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6793730 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6793731 the nfda is working with the fsa to ensure that the regulations are as effective as possible and that they benefit businesses and consumers alike
6793732 hemos conversado mucho consensuamos compartimos sesiones de trabajo hay que unirse y trabajar por el si
6793733 las declaraciones del presidente fueron tomadas fuera de contexto no hubo incitaci n se lo analiza s lo en ciertos puntos
6793734 el respeto no s lo debe ser del presidente a la poblaci n sino de la poblaci n hac a el presidente porque l es nuestro representante no es dable una falta de respeto venga de donde venga
6793735 las personas no son perfectas y por ende pueden cometer errores

6793737 playing behind joey dorsey at memphis i wasnt going to get much playing time ive had to wait my turn
6793738 i like the offense and i think ill fit right in
6793739 i also like the on campus area that means a lot of students can come to the games
6793740 david can play point guard shooting guard and maybe a little small forward
6793741 hes the type of player who can be the backbone of a team
6793742 i know when i was growing up in springfield i used to think amherst was about three hours away but were not that far
6793743 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments
6793744 intellect welcomes the ruling in the us court of appeal open source licences are just as important for compliance as those purchased from proprietary vendors software use must still comply with the terms and conditions this can include an obligation to share any changes made with others in the community giving the same protection to open source software as to traditional software models ensures that open source has a sustainable future
6793745 it is great news it means it is no longer viable to say there are all sorts of risks associated with open source and it will make a difference in terms of market and media perceptions proprietary suppliers have been claiming it is risky and that tactic is less likely to work now
6793746 open source is a large movement and this is one relatively minor licence among many open source licences so even if the ruling had not come it would not have made the open source movement collapse but it is a nice step forward that one of the licences is enforceable which is a good thing
6793747 i know a range of open source projects where firms took their code with impunity on the assumption no one could do anything
6793748 so this ruling gives all open source licences stronger ground to say you must respect our intellectual property

6793750 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6793751 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6793752 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6793753 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6793754 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6793755 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6793756 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6793757 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6793758 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6793759 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6793760 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6793761 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6793762 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6793763 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6793764 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6793765 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6793766 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6793767 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6793768 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6793769 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6793770 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6793771 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6793772 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6793773 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6793774 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6793775 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6793776 the first question organisations need to answer is whether their turnover rates are outside the norm and need addressing
6793777 the typical organisation in todays environment can view a five per cent staff turnover as a normal cost of doing business
6793778 it managers often worry that investments in training will be reaped by other organisations when it workers shop their new skills around
6793779 but this study indicates that investing in training is actually the best way to retain employees
6793780 while offering competitive salaries and benefit packages may be important for recruitment providing quality of life incentives and enhancing working environments are more important for retention
6793781 yo primera vez que llegaba a un escenario de tal magnitud cuando llegu me impresion por ver tantas l neas no era familiar para mi cuando vi era una cancha sumamente grande
6793782 not tranquilos a los jugadores habl con bola os luis me dice esta cancha es grand sima y bueno comenzamos a entrenar en trabajo reducido 15 20 minutos cuando yo sent un dolor en la espalda
6793783 son las situaciones del f tbol fuimos al hotel est bamos conversando y habl bamos de la situaci n de la cancha pero pas vino el partido y ganamos toda la gente feliz luego del partidos todos dec an que la cancha era dur sima
6793784 hemos venido ac a buscar el oro pero no merecimos derrotar a argentina sabemos que la medalla de bronce no es valorada por los brasile os pero conf o en que en el futuro nos sentiremos orgullosos de ella
6793785 todos vinieron a china para buscar una medalla y nosotros tenemos una
6793786 once again nbc decides to fuck more then half the nation in the ass by not televising the usa vs argentina basketball game live to anyone except the est you know the today show is so damn important god does nbc suck
6793787 i cannot believe they did this again and without warning
6793788 we are just about ready for the tip off of the argentina redeem team game
6793789 i think people are getting a kick out of him
6793790 i believe i try very hard not to go overboard or to step overboard
6793791 but i must clear the air you cant let injustices go unnoticed you have to fight you have to take a stand
6793792 hes a hugger he gives you the fist in the elbow or in the shoulder
6793793 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6793794 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6793795 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6793796 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6793797 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6793798 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6793799 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6793800 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6793801 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6793802 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6793803 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6793804 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6793805 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6793806 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6793807 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6793808 kismayu is under our control we overpowered them and concluded the fighting
6793809 were still chasing those fighters who ran away the situation is calm and we urge the people to stay peaceful
6793810 the difference between professional modelers and concept modelers is like the difference between high def and analog television
6793811 and that lets us build high quality parts with crisp features
6793812 that gives us high throughput capacity for a given build volume
6793813 build time is determined only by the how tall the parts are
6793814 we have a support removal method that doesnt put any pressure on the part
6793815 you can pack them in any way that fits as long as the parts arent touching
6793816 non violence as the most effective way to struggle for an independent democratic peaceful iraq
6793817 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6793818 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6793819 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

6793825 the bottom line for children is i dont have just one and a half person who is nuts about me

6793828 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6793829 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6793830 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6793831 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6793832 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6793833 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6793834 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6793835 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

6793841 dont take this the wrong way but im not a big fan of the stadium
6793842 its strictly an architectural observation now the physical is just going to move across the street
6793843 at approximately 3pm mountain time a mccain staff member in denver opened an envelope that contained a threatening letter and an unknown white powder as a precautionary measure the campaign office was immediately closed and staff was sent to a local hospital for medical evaluation local authorities as well as the fbi and united states secret service have investigated the scene and determined that the substance poses no threat
6793844 it is not an obstacle it is a stepping stone
6793845 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6793846 should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6793847 were intended for me personally rather than for the general public
6793848 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
6793849 when californias economy catches a cold these local agencies catch pneumonia
6793850 local governments believe they absolutely need this extra revenue in hard times
6793851 but what about the hard times being experienced by the people who have to pay the bills
6793852 november is a good ballot for these measures because there will be a high turnout particularly among democrats and young voters who are more likely to be supportive
6793853 if i were running these ballot campaigns i would put them on this ballot
6793854 im guessing that a large percentage of the measures will pass
6793855 with the state budget in crisis there is a concern that money will get tight and having local sources will help ensure that schools dont have to cut programs
6793856 at a time when people suffered tremendous financial problems they saw the value in parks and open spaces
6793857 we think that when people take a look at what we accomplished with the 1998 bond and realize that were not asking for a new tax or raising their taxes i dont think they will quibble
6793858 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6793859 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6793860 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6793861 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6793862 despite loving my sony reader it will never be a substitute for the book such a perfect piece of technology sensual shareable and irreplaceable

6793868 you can lead a horticulture but you cant make her think
6793869 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6793870 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6793871 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured

6793874 i happen to disagree with them in regards to our film
6793875 its a shame that they are out there and i hope that when it comes out they will actually see the jokes for what they are a deep cutting satire of hollywood and the stars
6793876 everyone has the right to protest its a free country anytime that anyone feels that they are justified in their heart more power to them
6793877 i just think that the movie speaks for itself and its amazing i stand behind it and i am so proud of this movie
6793878 its the best movie ever and my favorite movie of the year thats my comment
6793879 sono fondamentali da quando nato il mondo le vibrazioni sono state utilizzate anche per curare i mali soprattutto per esempio se una voce pacata e profonda ci tocca in modo affascinante e sensuale e invece una voce stridula e paperesca ci infastidisce e ci irrita credo che sia la dimostrazione pratica del fatto che la

6793882 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6793883 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6793884 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6793885 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6793886 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6793887 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6793888 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6793889 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6793890 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6793891 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6793892 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time

6793897 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6793898 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6793899 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6793900 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

6793905 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6793906 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

6793917 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6793918 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6793919 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6793920 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead

6793926 we just love playing to huge crowds of country people because we feel right at home and they really relate to our music

6793931 you already have jeff you dont even have to pencil him in you know hes going to be a great linebacker
6793932 all through camp last year he was healthy and ready to go and then all of a sudden for him to go down so early it kind of sent us scrambling a bit the sheer disappointment he and his family went through was heartbreaking
6793933 i was devastated it was my senior year and there was so much potential with that team and having such a tight bond with those guys i was crushed those first couple of days
6793934 its still emotional to go back and think about how it felt
6793935 my first reaction was sheer depression to know how hard sanders prepared himself for his senior year to be with all the friends he came in with and to know he was no longer going to be going out with them
6793936 i know how much that hurt him and his family but they still came to all the games and jeff came to all the practices we talked about leading by example being around all the players
6793937 i felt like i became more of a coach because we had such a young group of guys
6793938 i was just trying to help those guys to be more comfortable on the field those first three games we were 1 2 it was very difficult for me to sit back and watch that but i had to swallow that and tell everybody to keep their heads up that it will get better because were a great team
6793939 it took awhile to adjust especially from the leadership part
6793940 its easy to be a leader when youre on the field leading by example when he was no longer on the field talking to the younger guys it really hurt the surprise was that justin hager stepped up and did a tremendous job for us and kyle olaughlin stepped up and did a very good job as well but we were missing a big part of our defense when jeff got hurt
6793941 that was a big loss for us we had guys who needed to step up
6793942 the guys up front helped us out a lot some younger guys really stepped up but it was a big loss not having his leadership out there having him back this year adds that much more
6793943 the defendant has been observed walking up and down the parking lot of the park del mar apartments complex in tampa wearing his uniform and carrying a ceremonial sword apparently practicing parade drills

6793951 its about finding health during the process of separation and divorce
6793952 often when someone is experiencing separation and divorce there is a tremendous amount of pain involved
6793953 they go through a grieving process it is similar in some respects to experiencing a loved ones physical death
6793954 many times you can move back and forth between those stages
6793955 the ultimate goal of the program is self acceptance which is paramount for recovery our hope is to help them understand themselves better
6793956 the goal is to really support the people who come as they go through divorce and separation
6793957 one of the benefits is that we both experienced separation and divorce
6793958 its not always the same approach but it is certainly christ centred
6793959 there is a lot of concern over how slow it is going
6793960 we really need the same level of functionality in network infrastructure to make it departments jobs more feasible and ultimately this has to come from the vendors

6793971 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered

6793985 in light of the fact that the alpharma board declined this proposal we think it is important for the stockholders of both companies to be aware of this exciting opportunity it remains our strong preference to work cooperatively with alpharma regarding this proposal
6793986 the transaction would create a diversified specialty pharmaceutical company with greater commercialization capabilities an expanded portfolio of pain management products and a strengthened pipeline that would include multiple platform technologies
6793987 importantly it would also further diversify kings business with an additional source of steady cash flow from alpharmas animal health division a leading feed additives business

6793994 the merged business will be by far the biggest reinsurance intermediary in the world and will have unrivalled access to a global customer base
6793995 this is fair value for both parties the offer will be recognised as good value to benfield shareholders
6793996 the price is decent its game set and match as far as im concerned
6793997 the fact that senior management have committed their shares would indicate its their opinion that there arent any other potential bidders
6793998 at this stage we dont how institutions will react but we feel its a pretty attractive offer
6793999 this is a more effective way of promoting their product especially in this tivo world
6794000 it has been a bit of a rollercoaster at times but we are delighted that it will soon be built
6794001 once the drainage work is sorted out we can push ahead with the construction which will take around three months
6794002 its going to be a fantastic facility for young people and they are really looking forward to using it

6794010 you would think after what i have accomplished being nervous in front of school kids is just ridiculous
6794011 it isnt just trying to keep their attention that worries me but if its a co ed school or an all girls school i will be nervous
6794012 im still unable to be a confident speaker there is something about speaking to teenage girls which never gets easier
6794013 i get to do all sorts of training which is always fun
6794014 i recently did firearm training which is something most people dont get to do but thats part of my job so im very lucky
6794015 i consider money run my most complicated book there are more characters than usual which allows me to go deeper and at times explore the human condition
6794016 i didnt want to go into stereotypes i wanted my characters to be individuals i hope ashley and benjamin will intrigue many readers
6794017 it seemed like luck as if i went to bed and woke up to find it displayed on my computer monitor
6794018 as long as there is written language there will be books
6794019 a good author will guide their readers and help shape their thoughts thats what makes books so special and different from other mediums like film
6794020 like many authors i try to aim for the most unexpected over the top unbelievable events and try hard to keep it convincing
6794021 i sometimes use wikipedia as a source of research and through my studies i now believe the internet is over the top fiction
6794022 it comes down to balance if you can be convincing enough your readers will follow you anywhere
6794023 i use teenage heroes because i want my target audience to easily be able to relate to the characters
6794024 i dont enjoy writing about sex and drugs so that leaves me with action and you dont have to be a genius to realise teenagers are going to enjoy these books

6794027 air guitar is inherent to anyone who listens to rock music
6794028 i was particularly stoked they had the finals in san francisco
6794029 or id probably be in a circus or avoiding the law
6794030 bay area residents have embraced the competition and made it their own clearly no city is better suited to the absurdity of an event where multiple contestants dressed as rock stars wearing all manner of codpieces go onstage in front of hundreds of strangers with no instruments
6794031 by taking air guitarists out of the bedroom and putting them up on the national stage
6794032 it seems that air guitar is finally being accepted as a serious competition
6794033 i felt kind of like a johnny come lately with my first win
6794034 this year i really wanted to prove that i wasnt fly by night
6794035 id like to be david lee roth and eddie van halen all in one
6794036 the guitar was something i had to kind of unlearn
6794037 a strong beginning middle theatric breakdown and powerful climactic ending
6794038 this year i went on the tour and served as the mc a bit and i loved not having to compete
6794039 i think id like to move more in that direction
6794040 what i learned before is dont go in thinking youre the best
6794041 i am just going to do my best so that when the video shows up on youtube people will says thats awesome

6794045 die strecke gef llt mir sehr gut zum einen mag ich stra enkurse zum anderen alles was neu ist
6794046 es ist sehr gut was hier in der k rze der zeit errichtet wurde ich f hlte mich auf der strecke auf anhieb ausgesprochen wohl es ist komplett anders als monaco aber trotzdem prima
6794047 ich hatte keine technischen probleme mit den zeiten bin ich aber noch nicht zufrieden
6794048 ich erwarte dass das auto hier anders f hrt als in budapest
6794049 das ist in der formel 1 sehr kompliziert ein unterschied von zwei zehntel bar an einem reifen kann ein auto nahezu unfahrbar machen
6794050 ich bin sehr angetan diese strecke ist nicht nur die gegenwart sondern auch die zukunft und es ist toll so die anlage vom americas cup noch mal zu verwenden
6794051 das sollte man aber nicht berbewerten da war ich einer der ganz wenigen der am ende mit neuen reifen unterwegs war
6794052 am nachmittag war es nicht mehr ganz so gut aber wir haben herausgefunden was wir herausfinden wollten ich denke wir werden ganz gut aussehen die strecke macht fast noch mehr spa als gedacht

6794063 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied

6794065 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6794066 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6794067 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6794068 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6794069 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6794070 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6794071 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6794072 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6794073 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6794074 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6794075 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6794076 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6794077 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6794078 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6794079 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6794080 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6794081 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6794082 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6794083 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6794084 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6794085 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6794086 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6794087 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6794088 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6794089 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6794090 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6794091 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6794092 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6794093 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6794094 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6794095 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6794096 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6794097 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6794098 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6794099 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied

6794122 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6794123 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6794124 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6794125 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6794126 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6794127 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

6794129 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6794130 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit

6794133 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

6794135 the man with dog was risking his life for his dog thats his privilege but he was risking the lives of dozens of others including the police officers who had to stop him it may be a cruel fact but the officer was right its a dog and the man doesnt get to risk the lives of other people for it
6794136 i think that cop was out of line with his comments to the speeder he should have understood the urgency of the situation and escorted the man to the vet once the dog arrived safely it would then be appropriate to ticket him
6794137 i am wholeheartedly in support of the officer it seems to me to be extremely wrong to endanger the lives of human beings for the life of an animal on top of that the law was broken to do so the laws of our land are meant to give us the stability and safety we need as a productive and peaceful society it seems that we may have lost sight of what our priorities should be an animal is not on the same level as a human
6794138 ooooooh completely doable so lets get a move on and square it away
6794139 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america

6794185 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6794186 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6794193 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6794194 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6794195 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6794196 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6794197 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6794198 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6794199 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6794200 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6794201 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

6794220 the media have been used to promote cigarettes and smoking through infamous advertising icons such as the marlboro man and joe camel and through tobacco images in hollywood movies
6794221 the media have also been used to increase smoking cessation and reduce smoking initiation through paid advertising campaigns and public service announcements about the dangers of smoking
6794222 presents the most current and comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence on the impact of these forces and other media exposures on beliefs attitudes and behaviours concerning tobacco use
6794223 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6794224 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns
6794225 im very glad that the federal government has thrown its weight behind this important issue
6794226 i love you said to me by someone who ment it

6794232 als deutscher sehe ich das thema nicht so entspannt eine inflationsrate von heute etwas ber drei prozent das hat die vergangenheit gezeigt kann sich sehr schnell verdoppeln

6794248 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6794249 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6794250 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6794251 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education

6794254 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6794255 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it
6794256 you make sure that the teacher understands whats going on so they dont penalize them
6794257 i know for a fact people like me are going to have a hard time
6794258 it has been a great experience and a good opportunity for me to lead a team i am coaching in baseball because i want to be a head coach and a good coach it has been a great opportunity to come out and lead a group of guys we are big school guys i have been coaching kids from clemson tennessee old miss and boston college at carolina i get an opportunity to coach some elite athletes here i get to coach some major d 1 kids
6794259 it has been fun it has been fun to see those guys and talk to them and joke around guys like greg holt he will be playing third base when we play them and ill be coaching third and we will be talking about his swing it is cool to know so much about these kids our carolina guys in another situation with other coaches with their swings and their development i get to watch them and appreciate them in a little different way i get to ask them questions that is cool i will give you some information so that you can beat me laughs that was a good idea
6794260 it is truly baseball college baseball is great but the student athletes have a lot of demands and requirements on their time as far as campus life and academics at carolina we demand a lot of their time whether it is practice or study hall in the summer it is more the opportunity to play every day instead of practicing most of the week and playing weekends it is a pretty cool dynamic because it is closer to professional baseball which is a little bit more of my experience it has paid off for me as a coach after having six years in pro ball explaining to them that this is what it takes to come out and play hard every day
6794261 i am excited it is going to be a great facility and for me financially it is going to be a big improvement because we have not been able to do camps and as the camp coordinator it is kind of important to me the facilities will be top notch we have a winning percentage in our program that draws the top kids now we are adding one of the top facilities to what we have done so far it will be a very good tool for us to draw the best kids in the country to north carolina
6794262 i met coach jackson one time and what i have heard from people who know him is one of his biggest assets is in his tenacity as a recruiter i know that coach fox is very good at what he does he went through the hiring process with coach jackson i am sure that he will be an excellent choice
6794263 it has been an awesome experience i played at carolina then i left i did things a little differently most people who start in college coaching dont start at 30 years old or like i am at 29 now i played six years of professional ball then returned to finish my degree during that time i was coaching the orange high baseball team as well it has been an awesome next step during my coaching growth and growth during baseball from playing for coach fox at carolina and then coaching with him i have learned a lot i have learned about management and how to run teams things i use every day here at thomasville

6794273 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
6794274 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6794275 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen
6794276 we have seen the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as calls by some russian politicians to change the democratically elected government of georgia some question the territorial integrity of georgia that is why we believe that russia has gone too far
6794277 but american investors are now looking at the situation around russia with concern and asking questions

6794310 parlo di quei medici che si rifiutano di fare le interruzioni di gravidanza per motivi di credo religioso in italia laborto legale ma spesso non praticato dai medici in alcuni ospedali impossibile abortire non ci sono medici disposti a farlo

6794346 there may be changes in the text but we will not allow any changes that will impede the process or block cooperation
6794347 there were sharp differences in year ahead home price expectations depending on whether home prices had increased or decreased in the past year
6794348 importantly home price expectations over the next five years also improved
6794349 given long term inflation expectations however this implied that consumers expected no real gains in home prices over the next five years
6794350 the market had got itself into a very bearish frame of mind and i think a lot of people were very short
6794351 once prices began rising you saw a sort of self sustaining rally to allow them to cover their positions
6794352 i think that panic short covering rally has sort of run its course for today
6794353 i think its a bad idea in a way because youd have more people running around drunk
6794354 it would give them more opportunity to do that than when theyre not of age and there would probably be more wrecks
6794355 when people are 18 theyre old enough to move to college and live by themselves so why arent they able to drink
6794356 i know the emotional response of youre old enough to fight in the war but you cant buy beer and thats a point thats difficult to reject
6794357 but alcohol has an effect on some people that maturity alone can manage and i think the maturity assumed by a 21 year old is greater than that of an 18 year old
6794358 id like to see some more data about the law and what the consequences are of what we do
6794359 i would not be in favor of lowering the age without some kind of education along the way i dont think young people understand what the consequences of excessive drinking are
6794360 thats our tradition to discern to talk to have meetings
6794361 puts them at risk for what most people call alcohol poisoning

6794369 new york as a major world financial center remains resilient to the worst aspects of the us economic recession while percentage annual rental and value growth is down most investors consider new york to be stable and in the long term low risk
6794370 the pace of upward yield shift gathered momentum across many markets in the second quarter as renewed fears over a prolonged economic slowdown has raised risk premiums and the real possibility of increasing voids
6794371 the outlook for rents has been pared back across many markets to include some emerging markets where the battle against inflation has taken centre stage
6794372 markets exposed to the housing and consumer slowdowns are unsurprisingly displaying the weakest sentiment on downgrades to economic growth with the retail sector the least favoured in every region outside emerging asia and africa and middle east
6794373 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome

6794378 the role of local police striking a balance between immigration enforcement and civil liberties
6794379 law enforcement officers at the local level have been subjected to a whirlwind of conflicting political pressures which are growing in intensity because of the lack of a comprehensive national immigration policy

6794386 i was unprepared for what the arctic was all about
6794387 the amount of water from glaciers there were almost rapids streams and rivers flowing right out of the glacier we hiked to
6794388 its a different thing to actually see the impact of climate change to see so much geology in action you can see where glaciers are retreating how fjords have been created
6794389 but when that crucial sea ice melts the darker ocean absorbs more light and continues to accelerate climate change

6794415 a dise ar en la compu aprend solo en mi casa hay tradici n en el dise o mis t os fueron letristas mi hermano es dise ador multimedial y se ve que algo hered de eso yo tambi n
6794416 en un principio empec como un juego no hab a buenas p ginas web sobre san rafael y con mi hermano comenzamos a trabajar sobre una idea luego tom la forma que hoy tiene
6794417 esta idea surgi un poco porque es importante dar a conocer la historia de san rafael de no ser por las obras hidr ulicas que acompa an a cada pueblo de mendoza la provincia ser a un desierto ac hay mucho trabajo mucha historia tradici n y cultura
6794418 el baqueano es el que te gu a el que conoce el camino el que te lleva
6794419 san rafael es chico y todos se conocen cuando arm la p gina web la hice seriamente y eso hizo que hoy me conozcan por trabajar bien y tengan confianza en m en mis ideas y en mis productos
6794420 la idea es que contenga una descripci n de mendoza centr ndonos en sus bodegas y sus vinos est hecha en castellano y en ingl s con fotos direcciones todo ubicado en un mapa para el turismo que busca conocer esto
6794421 desde hace un tiempo se ha venido configurando la ruta del vino en los valles mendocinos esto genera diversas oportunidades de negocio que algunos j venes han aprovechado
6794422 esta gu a no tiene antecedentes en la zona es muy bueno es un producto innovador con ariel ya estamos pensando en la gu a del a o que viene porque esta ya es un xito
6794423 la relaci n de trabajo que tengo con el centro yo actualmente es una herramienta muy importante para m porque me ha permitido capacitarme y hacer consultor a con gente que sabe del tema y que me ha ido guiando para tomar las decisiones correctas en c mo conectarme con cada bodega y c mo hacer que mi proyecto sea lo suficientemente seductor para que cada bodega opte por estar dentro de la gu a para mi ha sido muy importante conectarme con el centro
6794424 el sentido de la gu a es contar a los visitantes las historias los personajes que existen alrededor de la uva y el vino sanrafaelino es una voz experta que les muestra las bellezas m s grandes de esta ciudad
6794425 esta gu a de vinos la idea es que englobe todas las bodegas ac de san rafael y que el turista cuando llegue ac a san rafael en una sola pieza gr fica encuentre toda la oferta bodeguera tur stica porque ahora todas las bodegas te hacen un circuito interno donde te hacen conocer la cava hasta la degustaci n final del producto
6794426 en una plancha alcanzar a a editar toda la publicaci n esa nica hoja grande plegada rinde 48 p ginas peque as
6794427 la idea es hacer algo de mucha calidad que haga una diferencia a la vista con la competencia algunas bodegas han sacado publicaciones propias pero nadie hizo hasta ahora una gu a de vinos de san rafael es cuesti n de arriesgarse
6794428 de las 10 bodegas que tienen wineshop en la ciudad ya hay dos que han confirmado su participaci n en la gu a adem s tambi n est n confirmadas peque as bodegas y bodegas artesanales

6794506 u s presidents george h w bush and bill clinton had promised the russians that nato would not expand into the former soviet union empire
6794507 that promise had already been broken in 1998 by nato s expansion to poland hungary and the czech republic and again in the 2004 expansion which absorbed not only the rest of the former soviet satellites in what is now central europe but also the three baltic states which had been components of the soviet union
6794508 the russians publicly and privately asked that kosovo not be given formal independence but instead continue its informal autonomy which was the same thing in practical terms russias requests were ignored
6794509 from the kosovo experience moscow concluded that the united states and europe were not prepared to consider russian wishes even in fairly minor affairs that was the breaking point if russian desires could not be accommodated even in a minor matter like this then clearly russia and the west were in conflict for the russians as we said the question was how to respond having declined to respond in kosovo the russians decided to respond where they had all the cards in south ossetia
6794510 we must avoid to be dependent on a russian veto
6794511 moscow had two motives the lesser of which was as a tit for tat over kosovo
6794512 if kosovo could be declared independent under western sponsorship then south ossetia and abkhazia the two breakaway regions of georgia could be declared independent under russian sponsorship
6794513 any objections from the united states and europe would simply confirm their hypocrisy
6794514 the russians knew the united states would denounce their attack
6794515 this actually plays into russian hands the more vocal senior leaders are
6794516 the war in georgia therefore is russias public return to great power status
6794517 the kremlin is telling europe we not only have the power to turn off siberian gas we can turn off every tap in the region any time we choose
6794518 putins russia got its hands around the energy needy throats of germans the french italians and many other europeans
6794519 when this crisis ends georgia will be either a model for a world that works or a world whose members do business with knives

6794521 on the one hand russia needs ukraine and georgia to be aligned with itself it cannot afford to have
6794522 by pushing for nato membership for georgia and ukraine the united states pits itself directly against russia
6794523 it says georgia is not qualified for a map because of unresolved conflicts on its territory berlin has also argued off the record that russia has no veto but russias views must be taken into account russia is a factor in decision making and this is undeniable and russian concerns cannot be ignored if we want a real partnership with russia this is the opposite of what germany said a year ago steinmeier is now saying i cannot hide my skepticism about georgia and ukraine joining the alliance

6794551 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6794552 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6794553 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6794554 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6794555 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6794556 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6794557 i cant trust him as far as i can throw him
6794558 you have my word dan that if you were to give her a vote i promise you i would not put you up she wouldnt either
6794559 every week so far ive had the possibility of being the swing vote which totally blows my mind
6794560 so april tried to buy my vote and it is tempting they know they cant win this thing without me and i love it
6794561 i am so grateful to have had the opportunity to get to know each and every one of you
6794562 every moment ive had in this house whether its laughs or as america knows fighting i will cherish every single moment as far as the voting i just ask that you vote whats best for you in this game play for you dont play for the person sitting next to you dont play for the person sitting across from you just play for you i just wish you guys the best of luck and no worries
6794563 im still confused when i was head of household why the house turned but i guess i will get my answers when i watch the season i have no idea i still dont have any answers
6794564 i think its always best to have some sort of a best friend in the house its a tough game i think sometimes you just have to take yourself out of that game it kind of gives you a break a little bit of sanity thats what i call him hes my sanity in the house
6794565 ollie had plans of moving to arizona before he ever met me so thats not the reason why hes moving to arizona im sure it might help his decision i guess to have a friend out in arizona i would love to have him out there
6794566 he wants to get his own place and i think that would be the best idea at this point we have lived together here well take it a step back usually you dont live together first then move out and then possibly move back in but thats the way were going to have to do it right now
6794567 can you picture marrying him maybe starting a family with him
6794568 youre putting me on the spot you have a lot of time to think in the house so we just took it day by day obviously our friendship has grown and im just thankful for that

6794576 we talked about the players that we have how to progress and we both know it is important for the club that we work together
6794577 we are working really hard we are moving in the right direction and hopefully we can do something positive in the next few days
6794578 the talks were positive we cannot discuss names but we are now both working to improve our squad
6794579 there was no friction but some personal problems now things are more clear and that is positive it was a private conversation
6794580 i have had no word about arsenal wanting gareth barry and that is all i want to say on the subject other than that we are working towards improving our squad
6794581 likewise there has been nothing more on xabi alonso at the beginning of the summer we were looking at ways of raising money but now we are happy with xabi he is a very good player
6794582 the offer we had was not good enough so why would we want to sell him
6794583 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6794584 steven has had two injuries he was 10 15 days without training and then it happened again that is why he did not start the match two weeks ago against standard liege
6794585 clearly in a couple of weeks he will be back to his best he has needed time to get fit after his injuries and it has been important to protect him
6794586 steven has great game intelligence and he can play anywhere gerrard played with intelligence and england drew that is all i would want to say about it
6794587 we know what is the best position for gerrard but he is capable of playing in other positions

6794617 after the huge success of the jem guitar we were faced with lots of pressure from dealers and the head office to make a less expensive version that more people could afford
6794618 we d had the roadster guitar and roadstar guitar series before so we contracted those to rg we wanted something like gibson had with sg
6794619 since we were really just taking the jem idea down a couple of price levels we had the jem design to guide us except for some trim differences the rg proto was much like the finished version
6794620 the basic design of the guitar has aged well and doesn t look dated the main elements of the guitar are still contemporary and have become somewhat of a classic design
6794621 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6794622 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6794623 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6794624 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6794625 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6794626 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed

6794643 unfortunately the fda asserts on the basis of its misreading of a 25 year old report that there is no evidence that dyes affect behavior

6794668 we went full speed tempo but from there we were thud on contact
6794669 we did not tackle except for three kicking team plays so some of the stats are skewed
6794670 caleb king were held out of action jackson led the rushing efforts with 11 carries for 51 yards while thomas had 20 yards on four carries and samuel had 10 yards and a touchdown on three carries
6794671 most of the plays were stopped as soon as the runner was touched we wanted to make sure that georgia southern got as many offensive snaps as georgia did
6794672 we got a good chance to work on all the transitions of the kicking game for instance from third down to punt from touchdown to extra point and from third down to field goal
6794673 transitioning all those substitutions was a big part of the day we still have a ways to go were not as clean as we need to be
6794674 they were very well prepared and had our players ready to go the guys who played for georgia southern also did a very good job in particular receiver made some nice plays
6794675 i know you want to watch the incredibles but just this once you think daddy can watch something he wants to

6794695 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighborhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6794696 the crucial element was the modeling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star the heating is caused by the extreme compression of the cloud as it is squashed and pulled apart by the black hole this is balanced by the cooling which requires detailed knowledge of how quickly the radiation can escape the cloud

6794699 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6794700 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6794701 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified

6794705 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation

6794724 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6794725 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6794726 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

6794738 emi s relationship with 30stm has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company the hard work of emi s global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fan base however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emi s investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
6794739 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea that s what we said too
6794740 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we and the fact that emi informed us that not only aren t they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldn t a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even

6794968 presents the most current and comprehensive analysis of the scientific evidence on the impact of these forces and other media exposures on beliefs attitudes and behaviours concerning tobacco use
6794969 this report sends a loud and clear message to policy makers we need less tobacco company marketing and more anti tobacco advertising
6794970 it shows why we need strong regulation of tobacco products and their marketing to prevent tobacco companies from continuing to target our children it also should prompt states to fully fund tobacco prevention and cessation campaigns that are proven to work and it should spur governments worldwide to implement the international tobacco control treaty which calls on governments to ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship and fund effective public education campaigns

6794979 the states leader of the public project mdots mohammed alghurabi said only one span will be successful the private plan is further along in the process

6794982 another state rep weighs in on detroit river international crossing
6794983 toll credits are earned when a state toll authority or a private entity funds a capital highway investment with toll revenues from existing facilities
6794984 by using toll credits to substitute for the required non federal share on a federal aid project federal funding can effectively be increased to 100 percent
6794985 toll credits provide states with more flexibility in financing projects for example by using toll credits 1 federal aid projects can be advanced when matching funds are not available 2 state and local funds normally required for matching may then be directed to other transportation projects

6794998 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6794999 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve

6795011 government of course which is picking up the tab both for masshealth and for those subsidies is struggling too
6795012 its also critical to make sure this program doesnt become a victim of that success and further victimize those segments of the community business health providers and insurers who make it work

6795094 ive been known to do things no one else has done when collecting autographs

6795097 i patterned my company after my only competitor easton press theyre in the business of publishing leather bound limited numbered editions i was very impressed with their quality and i sought out their binder
6795098 now our books are bound and printed by the same companies with moir patterned sheets a built in satin bookmark gilded page edges and gold stamping and raised hubs on the spines we go the extra step and add a photograph of the author signing our books on the inside and a dual hologram seal one on the signed page and one on the certificate of authenticity this way only one book can match each certificate it makes for a beautiful product
6795099 a lot of people have accused me of fakes because they dont think anyone in the world can have 50 000 rare autographed books i have never faked an autograph in my life
6795100 many of the groups members are great people and very professional booksellers
6795101 i buy books from many abaa members however it saddens me that the organizations leadership is so aggressively trying to maintain their monopoly on the rare book market that they would attempt to discredit honest people the time wasted in terrorizing me has allowed others who are guilty of faking autographed books to slip through the cracks and steal money from other honest people
6795102 it is true that people who have small dreams or simple minds simply cannot believe that a poor guy from the south can become a multi millionaire just by taking a few risks

6795106 it seems to me that the republican party is not as far as i can tell a one issue party abortion rights would just be one issue among many that would have to be evaluated
6795107 our main criteria is knowing we could sleep at night knowing they could be president of the united states
6795108 select the best person whos able to do that and if that person happens to be pro choice the party will support that
6795109 it seemed destined to add fuel to the fight already smoldering over abortion rights

6795160 chair holders are to be distinguished theologians who think from within the roman catholic tradition while exploring and expressing the tradition in contemporary contexts
6795161 this is a woman who is in favor of abortion in favor of contraception homosexuality and women priests
6795162 i mean how much more anti catholic can you get
6795163 as a catholic institution for higher education our understanding of ourselves is that we are to uphold the churchs teachings on abortion and other subjects as the holy father calls for
6795164 a national organization that works for catholic women to be priests and for a more inclusive roman catholic church
6795165 an arm of the abortion lobby in the united states and throughout the world

6795189 id been playing punto to pull all night and he hit it right where i was supposed to be if it hits your glove youve got to catch that
6795190 i could have buried that split finger a little bit better than i did
6795191 i could have bounced it a little bit more and gone for the strikeout and if i did who knows what would have happened i do everything to prepare myself to pitch but im not getting the results i want its frustrating
6795192 nicky ripped it pretty good and torii had a long ways to go
6795193 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it but hes as good as they get out there we got a little lucky there
6795194 it all starts with pitching and scott baker was really really good going up against mr lackey whos always really good against us
6795195 we knew we were going to be in for a battle and it was its a nice start to a road trip
6795196 we missed some opportunities but in those opportunities you look over at the other side and you see whos pitching he didnt miss too many spots
6795197 but i know this park and the ball doesnt really travel at night i hit it good enough but at 387 feet its a little deep i guess that was tough to swallow
6795198 heute arbeiteten wir uns durch unser normales programm auch wenn es ein neuer kurs war
6795199 es ist eine ziemlich gute strecke sch n zu fahren auch wenn es am morgen sehr schmutzig und rutschig war wir hatten eine sehr gute zweite einheit mit ein paar schnellen zeiten und machten im hinblick auf das setup gute fortschritte das getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung arbeitet gut und wir k nnen ziemlich viel druck machen aber lasst uns einmal abwarten was morgen und im qualifying passieren wird
6795200 dies war f r uns auf einer neuen strecke ein interessanter tag
6795201 die strecke ist sehr herausfordernd aber sie f hlt sich eher wie eine permanente rennstrecke als wie ein stra en kurs an da er eine menge auslaufzonen und lange geraden sowie einen sehr glatten asphalt bietet heute morgen war es jedoch angesichts des vielen staubs sehr schwierig eine gute runde auf ihm zu fahren am nachmittag war es besser aber es war immer noch ziemlich staubig und wenn man einmal etwas von der ideallinie abkommt dann hat man berhaupt keine haftung
6795202 alles war wirklich normal mit den reifen absolvierten wir ein standard programm wir haben wie gew hnlich ein paar probleme mit graining aber alles in allem bin ich mit dem tag ganz zufrieden das getriebe ohne zugkraftunterbrechung ist ein sehr guter schritt und ich war ber die fortschritte gl cklich
6795203 generell war es f r uns ein interessanter tag da es wie immer herausfordernd ist auf einem neuen kurs zu fahren besonders auf einem der die fahrer fordert
6795204 wir hatten heute keine wirklichen mechanischen probleme nur ein kleines bremsproblem bei giancarlo was sehr schnell behoben wurde
6795205 alles in allem verfolgten wir unser normales programm und die reifen bewertung und auch wenn es auf basis der form am freitag schwierig zu sagen ist denke ich dass wir konkurrenzf higer aussehen und einen kleinen schritt nach vorn gemacht haben wir hoffen dass wir diesen ber den rest des wochenendes mitnehmen k nnen
6795206 a situa o bem diferente agora nosso time mudou em muitos pontos e os advers rios tamb m est o diferentes os jogos v o ter hist rias diferentes mas sabemos que precisamos ficar preocupados precisamos somar pontos

6795208 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6795209 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6795210 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6795211 on the 6th of july 2005 it was announced that london had been successful in its bid for the 2012 games just 24 hours later 52 people were murdered in four terrorist attacks in london which changed the security landscape overnight
6795212 the intercept calls were forwarded from four cellular antennas their coverage circles overlapped atop the u s embassy

6795215 it was wonderful to meet chris hoy again at this event which was a celebration of our strong sporting traditions and our long standing links with china

6795221 i spent years as a pow with john mccain and his finger should not be near the red button
6795222 did not know the locations state city of the walmart stores that do such as a
6795223 fully assess the amount of existing and planned off street parking
6795224 josh you have a point it would be a big deal if we enforced existing speed limits on residential streets i care less about limited access highways and stuff but if
6795225 re the congresswoman who wants to lower the national speed limit does she really think people are going to drive slower i wouldnt bet on it
6795226 the nyt newell endorsement is a big deal but i wish theyd done it with more enthusiasm and made it explicitly clear that they not only prefer newell over the other
6795227 i encourage everyone to volunteer for the newell campaign that ny times endorsement is even bigger considering that not only is silver the speaker but that newell had to prove to
6795228 if they start enforcing the caps were going to have to change service
6795229 this isnt really an issue thats just going to be about frontier
6795230 virtually every broadband provider has been suddenly discovering that theres this so called bandwidth crisis going on in the united states
6795231 if they continue to make the necessary investments theres no reason they cant keep up
6795232 id always said id never write a book like this
6795233 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6795234 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6795235 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6795236 and he and about four other people would read that
6795237 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6795238 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
6795239 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
6795240 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
6795241 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
6795242 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
6795243 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
6795244 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
6795245 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
6795246 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
6795247 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here

6795251 it helped me remember helped me look in on the wreckage of my past and i really havent had a thirsty day since i started working on it
6795252 on the close of nominations today i have submitted a list of nominees who wish me to contest the dublin election in next years european election
6795253 i believe that i can do this because i am originally from dublin and while my political base is in bray and co wicklow i am very familiar with the issues that affect the greater dublin area
6795254 i know it will be a tough contest to win back the green partys european seat in dublin but i believe it is possible and it is vital and i will be seeking the support of party members to achieve this

6795260 to the christian church in the most catholic sense of the word supernatural religion has always stood for something far more than a system of spiritual instruction or an instrument of moral suasion the deep sense of sin which is central to her faith demands such a divine interposition in the course of natural development as shall work actual changes from guilt to righteousness from sin to holiness from life to death in the sphere not merely of consciousness but of being

6795277 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system

6795293 its a small world but i wouldnt want to paint it
6795294 es ist wie bei der fu ball wm da haben die organisatoren und die fifa auch zu einem gewissen teil die kosten bernommen
6795295 allerdings sprechen wir noch von einem hypothetischen fall wir m ssen jetzt erst einmal die ergebnisse der b probe abwarten
6795296 analizando algunos procesos que pueden explicar el tiempo y modo de la dispersi n humana en las am ricas
6795297 a m me interesan preguntas generales que puedan servir para entender el proceso de evoluci n humana dentro de am rica porque el proceso de evoluci n no termin en africa cuando se genera el homo sapiens
6795298 am rica es muy importante cuando uno entiende lo que es el proceso de evoluci n humana porque es el nico lugar donde somos la nica especie que hay en asia africa y europa siempre hubo una especie antes que el homo sapiens desde este punto de vista am rica es un gran laboratorio para entender el proceso evolutivo
6795299 uno toma paralelos de grupos cazadores recolectores de distintas partes del mundo y normalmente tienen tasas de crecimiento muy bajas que est n en el uno por ciento pero los modelos que nosotros estamos desarrollando muestran que con ese porcentaje se habr an
6795300 parece ser que es un proceso mucho m s r pido que implica una tasa de crecimiento mucho m s alta y si una tasa de crecimiento es muy alta no se comportan como los par metros que tenemos actualmente y eso marca detalles culturales rasgos morfol gicos de una poblaci n a otra
6795301 la forma en que las poblaciones crecen son distintas en diferentes lugares de am rica y eso hace parecer que haya un reflujo de poblaci n
6795302 es un lugar donde se crece muy r pidamente porque es un ambiente muy rico y muy diverso y eso podr a estar produciendo que la gente migre hacia el norte y no necesariamente hacia el sur

6795307 using the olympics to crack down on peaceful human rights activists censor foreign and domestic journalists and displace chinese

6795311 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6795312 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6795313 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6795314 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6795315 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6795334 west brom scored 88 league goals last season and we were the third lowest scorers in the championship with 53
6795335 we had the second or third best defensive record and yet we finished outside the play offs so scoring goals will ultimately get you promotion im absolutely convinced we carry more of a goal threat
6795336 we do look like conceding more and if we can eliminate that then wed be far more solid
6795337 lets hope chris proves to be that this season last season we had footballers but they didnt want to get in the box we would not have scored those two headers last season
6795338 were still looking there are two or three were looking at and weve been looking all over the place
6795339 we are doing alright we have got neill collins richard stearman and darren ward im happy with the squad we were one down because darren looked like going out the door
6795340 but hes trained particularly well and done well in the games
6795341 the arts painting music literature etc reveal the otherwise hidden ideas and impulses of a society
6795342 it is the artist not the critic who gives society something of lasting value
6795343 as long as people in a society are hungry or out of work or lack the basic skills needed to survive the use of public resources to support the arts is inappropriate and perhaps even cruel when one considers all the potential uses of such money
6795344 in order for any work of art whether film literature sculpture or a song to have merit it must be understandable to most people
6795345 the true value of a civilization is reflected in its artistic creations rather than in its scientific accomplishments
6795346 governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive because it is primarily in cities that a nations cultural traditions are preserved and generated
6795347 to truly understand your own culture no matter how you define it requires personal knowledge of at least one other culture one that is distinctly different from your own
6795348 tradition and modernization are incompatible one must choose between them
6795349 originality does not mean thinking something that was never thought before it means putting old ideas together in new ways
6795350 the function of science is to reassure the purpose of art is to upset
6795351 el procedimiento es que el centro de control aeroportuario tiene que llamar al 112 y decirle activo el plan de emergencias entonces el jefe de sala del 112 es el que tiene que movilizar servicios de acuerdo con el protocolo es decir polic a guardia civil summa samur protecci n civil bomberos pero el que tiene que dar el pistoletazo de salida es el aeropuerto lo que s les adelanto es que aunque todav a no tenemos todos los datos el plan del 112 se activ por llamadas de particulares que fueron muchas
6795352 no eso quiere decir lo que he dicho cuando est toda la secuencia de llamadas podremos determinar en qu momento desde el punto de vista t cnico real podemos entender que barajas ha activado el plan
6795353 sin esperar nada m s y como consecuencia de las llamadas de particulares
6795354 la direcci n del 112 activ el plan de emergencias sin llamar al aeropuerto
6795355 cuando barajas activ su plan de emergencias el plan del 112 llevaba tiempo activado

6795378 we are currently reviewing their technical and economic terms but not their political component
6795379 did someone within the u s suggest that iraq reach out to russia as a show of good will or did russia want to show that they are indispensable in the middle east that they are a player
6795380 russia wants to go back into areas where it has lost influence
6795381 they might be able to say we are a responsible player that would certainly counter their image over the past two weeks as a force that can do a lot of damage
6795382 the only danger is if there are deals to sell off some of that infrastructure to russia power plants and such
6795383 that would come with greater political influence which would not fit in with our policies in the middle east

6795396 debemos encontrar soluciones para combatir la pirater a la gente se esfuerza mucho y se merecen que les paguen
6795397 a la vez creo que hay mejores soluciones que perseguir a la gente por dinero no s cuales son aparte de crear experiencias interactivas que hagan m s dif cil mantener el mismo nivel de juego cuando es pirata

6795606 50 and his attorneys met yesterday with suffolk county authorities regarding the fire that destroyed 50s house

6795610 he said that he was going to have someone come kill me and see what he does this is what he did

6795617 to what disease in the naturall body of man i may exactly compare this irregularity of common wealth i know not
6795618 its always enjoyable to come to a new venue and im impressed it was pretty hot out there but the track is good fun and the layout is interesting i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights we had a good day the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that the afternoon was much better and the car got more and more into the set up window i hope we can keep going in this direction because it has been a productive day
6795619 that was not a particularly good day for me we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight the track is good though and i like it in karting we used to race on a lot of street circuits so learning it doesnt take long but you need to find a compromise on set up because there is a mix of slow corners and higher speed sections with long straights the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the set up right

6795630 it was good to finally get out on the new valencia street circuit today after previously experiencing the lap on the simulator and having a closer look during our track walk yesterday we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there the track is very dusty and if you go offline your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6795631 the track is very dirty as it is so new and its very easy to lose a bit of direction as the track improves the car balance changes and the tyres behave differently
6795632 jenson has obviously done a good job today and is looking extremely competitive

6795637 everyone affected by the disaster should apply with fema to find out what they may qualify for
6795638 it is imperative that people call and apply before the deadline even if your home is insured you still may be eligible for disaster assistance for under insured losses
6795639 there are voluntary organizations working to help people affected by dolly
6795640 contributing to a known organization can make a difference especially for some who may not be eligible for state or federal disaster assistance
6795641 our vals work directly with local community and faith based organizations to help with unmet needs and long term recovery
6795642 after investigating two options it has been decided the preferred corridor will run within the existing energex easement that traverses pringle hill
6795643 it is the governments preference to co locate the pipeline within existing easements wherever possible
6795644 given the difficult terrain of pringle hill investigations were undertaken by linkwater projects to assess if there was a viable option for the preferred corridor
6795645 consultation with residents within the area of investigation including residents along the energex easement and the rosemount anti pipeline action group rapag aided the assessment of the alternative option
6795646 by listening to the community and their concerns we have been able to assess the options and provide a balanced decision
6795647 residents outside the energex easement will this week receive a letter stating that they are no longer within the preferred corridor for investigation
6795648 interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on the eis when its released later this year
6795649 linkwater projects will continue to consult with the community prior to the release of the eis to ensure community issues are addressed

6795652 i believe an interest in the creative and performing arts including music drama and dance has positive flow on benefits for other areas of learning
6795653 elanora state school already enjoys a strong academic sporting and cultural reputation and the new performing arts centre will further support the students achievements
6795654 this project reflects the bligh governments commitment to providing high quality education facilities for all queensland students
6795655 i also acknowledge the federal governments contribution of 147 000
6795656 the school community and the parents and citizens association also worked tirelessly to raise funds
6795657 this new performing arts centre is used by the students during the day and by a local dance group after hours
6795658 i congratulate all involved for helping to deliver this valuable community asset
6795659 using advanced genetic technologies scientists from the csiro food futures national flagship have been able to selectively breed fast growing high health prawns in close collaboration with gold coast marine aquaculture one of queenslands leading prawn farming companies
6795660 these prawns possess all the genetic markers for success in terms of size taste and the ability to thrive and they take the guess work out for farmers who currently rely on the unpredictability of wild stocks
6795661 its also a sustainability win with farmers having to rely less on trawling to replenish their stocks throughout the year and greatly lessens the impact of farming on marine ecosystems
6795662 this technology will further assist the aquaculture industry in queensland to continue to be environmentally sustainable while providing high quality highly nutritious seafood with excellent health benefits and positive benefits for regional communities
6795663 in recent times there has been a strong decline in the production of large farmed prawns particularly black tiger prawns as well as a decline of natural stocks in the south east asian region
6795664 increasing farm yields for queensland farmers will give them a real market advantage and boost the states aquaculture industry
6795665 this funding has brought the project forward at least three years and its destined to bring great returns to queensland
6795666 our work to date gives me confidence to predict that we can help prawn farmers to double their yield in three generations three years
6795667 these offspring are domesticated which means that every generation we can select the best and healthiest performers we can then use our genotyping technology to breed the ideal prawn for the consumer rather than farming the offspring of wild stocks each year
6795668 the industry is keen to come on board with the csiro we have the knowledge and the technology to enable farmers to make the most of their production
6795669 were looking forward to working with dr preston on further improving spawning rates and the genetic selection of prawn families that will produce high quality offspring on the farm
6795670 the queensland government has invested more than 3 billion in innovation science and research since 1998 i think this demonstrates our deep and ongoing commitment to maintaining queenslands reputation as the smart state
6795671 ecospecifiers reputation in the middle east has been enhanced and business activity has expanded rapidly following the companys attendance at the big 5 last year as part of the trade queensland business delegation
6795672 in march this year ecospecifier launched its services in the united arab emirates which include verification of environmental claims and assessment of the environmental impacts of ecologically or health beneficial green building products
6795673 the company is building a strong association with and reputation in the middle east green building industry and is beginning to take advantage of obvious synergies with dubais 2015 strategic plan to ensure all buildings are constructed in line with environmental best practices
6795674 at this years big 5 trade show ecospecifier will be a major contributor to helping make it easier for ehibition visitors to locate green building products and services
6795675 with the help of ecospecifier visitors to the 2008 event will be able to easily identify and locate all exhibiting green building products compiled into a simple directory contained within the official event guide for the first time
6795676 as well as the green product directory it will be the first time visitors will have the opportunity to view a showcase of green products selected by a panel of eminent local judges
6795677 the new deal with big 5 will see ecospecifier providing key verification services for the big 5 green building product awards for innovative green products and for the new green building product section in the trade shows 2008 product catalogue
6795678 as part of its role in the awards ecospecifier will offer a free basic listing assessment on its website ecospecifier ae to qualifying products and these will be highlighted in the catalogue
6795679 the ongoing success of ecospecifiers middle east launch is a welcome outcome from trade queenslands construction and infrastructure strategic export project for this key target region for queensland exports
6795680 2 republican sources say mccain has apparently settled on romney as his pick but no offer has been made
6795681 i like anything that puts kansas in a positive light she said
6795682 anything about the vice presidential choice should be directed to the obama campaign
6795683 bidens the one the only question is whether obama was wise and self aware enough to know that
6795684 former gov tim pawlenty of minnesota are the top contenders
6795685 people close to the campaign also floated a wild card choice gen david h petraeus the top american commander in iraq they said it was not beyond the realm of possibility that mr mccain would ask him to join the ticket although gen petraeus has no experience in elective government and has said repeatedly that he is not interested in the
6795686 this is exactly the sort of baseless horserace speculation that i frequently criticize
6795687 our analysis suggests that the mccain ticket jumps by 13 points by adding gov pawlenty to the ticket
6795688 i dont think i will speculate on that today he has a lot of very good people to choose from and i know he will make a great choice

6795727 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law

6795733 mi objetivo no es quedarme en madrid sino irme a la premier league
6795734 quedarme en el real madrid no es mi objetivo para la pr xima temporada respeto mucho al club a los jugadores y principalmente a la afici n que siempre me ha tratado bien pero no es mi objetivo tengo una propuesta buena para mi y para el club tambi n y mi objetivo la pr xima temporada no es seguir en el real madrid
6795735 el principal motivo es que tengo la ilusi n de jugar la liga inglesa el chelsea tiene una gran plantilla un gran equipo tengo el objetivo de jugar all no tengo nada en contra del real madrid estoy muy agradecido porque me ha dado muchas cosas me ha dado una proyecci n muy grande pero en este momento mi objetivo es salir del real madrid espero que se pueda resolver lo m s r pido posible
6795736 no es por dinero simplemente porque tengo el objetivo de salir mi objetivo personal es ser el mejor jugador del mundo y en el real madrid eso no va a ser posible entonces tengo el objetivo de jugar la pr xima temporada en la liga inglesa
6795737 he cumplido un ciclo he jugado tres temporadas en el real madrid he dado el m ximo de m he hecho goles he ganado dos ligas que no es f cil creo que mi etapa en el real madrid ha llegado al final espero que los directivos lleguen a un acuerdo con el chelsea para solventar mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible
6795738 ha habido muchos casos similares a la inversa con el real madrid de protagonista sin ir m s lejos su salida del santos o recientemente el caso de cristiano ronaldo
6795739 ya le dije eso al presidente a los directivos y al entrenador tambi n que no es mi objetivo seguir en el real madrid cada jugador tiene una personalidad yo tengo la m a y no lo hab a hablado con la prensa para evitar pol micas
6795740 ahora estoy diciendo la verdad quiero salir y tengo la personalidad de decir por la prensa que no tengo el objetivo de quedarme en el real madrid agradezco a la afici n su cari o a los jugadores con los que tengo una amistad para toda la vida pero mi objetivo la pr xima temporada es jugar la premier league
6795741 mi relaci n con el entrenador y los jugadores es la mejor posible tuve la suerte de tener unos compa eros buenos que siempre me han tratado bien tengo un cari o enorme por todos los jugadores sin excepci n ninguna extranjeros y espa oles por schuster tambi n me parece un entrenador excelente con quien nunca tuve un problema no tengo nada malo que hablar de los jugadores ni del entrenador
6795742 sino que quiero resolver mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible
6795743 a partir del momento que el entrenador me pone a jugar lo hago al cien por cien primero porque llevo una camiseta por detr s una afici n que exige mucho segundo porque en el campo es mi imagen que transmito a los dem s y tercero por toda la plantilla porque si voy flojo a un bal n est perjudicando a toda la plantilla y eso no me gusta cuando entro para jugar lo hago a tope unas veces me sale y otras no pero juego a tope siempre
6795744 es que los directivos entiendan mi situaci n resolverla lo m s r pido posible pero yo voy a seguir como profesional que soy nunca he faltado a ning n entrenamiento del real madrid he entrenado todos los d as y voy a seguir haci ndolo sobre jugar no s si voy a jugar o no principalmente porque si las cosas no me salen bien la gente puede decir que no me salen porque estoy con la cabeza all para evitar ese tipo de comentario es mejor que schuster ponga a otros jugadores
6795745 intent dar el m ximo de m claro que estoy pensativo y quiero que se resuelva todo lo m s r pido posible pero cuando entro al campo me intento olvidar de todo lo que pasa fuera e intento dar el m ximo
6795746 por la calle caminando tambi n me puedo doblar el tobillo y lesionarme lo que me preocupa es el pensamiento de la afici n que piensen que no juego bien porque tengo la cabeza en el chelsea en este momento es mejor que no juegue y que resuelvan mi situaci n lo m s r pido posible
6795747 gracias gracias por el cari o y el tratamiento que tuvieron conmigo

6795749 we had a great dinner at fish and farm last night
6795750 you dont play many third sets for the olympic gold medal
6795751 if there was one time to get fired up that was the time right there
6795752 you know some athletes say you just get in a zone and you dont think you just do it and you do all the right things its pretty amazing
6795753 on the mens international tour theres 32 good teams that are pretty awesome very rarely do you get an easy match so its pretty tough to dominate
6795754 weve talked about it a lot and said hey lets just try and do what misty and kerri do theyre just so much better than everyone else everyone else is catching up a little bit but when they turn it on no one comes close to them on the mens side its not that way i recognize that were not going to be 108 0 were going to lose a few tournaments so just to be within shouting distance of them i look at that as wow thats an accomplishment they push us
6795755 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6795756 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6795757 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6795758 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6795759 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6795760 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal
6795761 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6795762 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6795763 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6795764 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6795765 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6795766 its a jock place for guys to come in and talk about jock stuff

6795848 from filtering our water to providing habitat to supplying timber and pulp woodlands have always been and continue to be a vital resource for our region and waterways
6795849 approximately 750 000 acres an amount of land equivalent to 20 washington d c s have been developed since the early 1980s
6795850 and about 100 acres of forest are lost each day remaining forests also face new stresses like fragmentation air pollution invasive pests diseases and damage to new growth from browsing deer

6795877 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6795878 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6795879 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6795880 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
6795881 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6795882 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists

6795890 pensamos que esto era una respuesta a un misterio que ha durado demasiado tiempo
6795891 if you want me to estimate how much time id say a couple of weeks before you see a major pullout
6795892 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
6795893 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
6795894 we need to ensure that there are robust contingency plans for managing in an orderly manner the default of a major participant
6795895 a critical question for regulators and supervisors is what their appropriate field of vision should be
6795896 under our current system supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation an alternative approach would broaden the mandate of regulators
6795897 the process is not always as nimble as we might like
6795898 for that reason less formal processes may sometimes be more effective and timely

6795901 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6795902 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6795903 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centred
6795904 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6795905 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6795929 at playfirst we introduced character and narrative to our games we obsessed on meta structural devices such as story development and even simple sounding aspects like map screens and expert levels all in service of answering the players question why am i doing this which wasnt being answered by abstract match 3 games
6795930 our consumers could say oh im solving this level to help flo fix up her restaurant and become a successful entrepreneur the ability to nurture our consumers connection to the characters and provide them with a clear sense of objective through storylines has proven very powerful
6795931 i believe that the next step is to create a similar metastructure to answer the question why did i do that last night we need to help the player get something or somewhere more tangible maybe to another level of status or fill out a collection or help a friend or in some other manner to achieve something worth talking about but keep it simple or it wont be relevant to the masses

6796041 an athlete could insure their gold medal as you would any other valuable household item that requires all risks cover the big issue is agreeing the value of the medal with the insurance company and establishing whether a replacement is actually possible
6796042 the medal will have an actual metal market value based around size weight and purity but that is likely to be much lower than an athletes perceived value of the medal or even the ebay price if the international olympic committee will replace the medal they may be able to indicate a cost to do this either way the key is agreeing with the insurance company the insured value of the medal
6796043 the medals can be insured on an all risks of physical loss or damage basis the intrinsic value of the medals would be relatively low given the low price of silver however given the success of the games for team gb and with the build up to 2012 the commercial value may increase to in excess of ten fold the intrinsic value maybe more for the likes of rebecca adlington
6796044 the discussion will be about just how you value the medal because in cold terms it is the value of the metal which it contains but it means so much more and would be viewed by the majority of people as far more valuable
6796045 given the limited nature of the medals if one was to be stolen the thief would find it hard to sell it because any buyer would question who the original winner was and the publicity surrounding the theft of a medal would make them almost impossible to pass on
6796046 if it was stolen and kept you would be unable to show it to anyone because the chances are that word would quickly get out on its whereabouts
6796047 in the case where an the london organising committee locog 2012 temporarily borrows all the medals to put them on public show then locog would have to insure them as they would be in their care custody and control
6796048 again the key is agreeing the value and there may also be special security requirements as a warranty to the policy eg locked and alarmed showcase uniformed security permanently guarding the medals in a room with cctv electronic detection etc
6796049 no other special insurance would apply for the victory parade unless locog decided to include other more hazardous activities that would be normal exclusions under liability property or pa policies that they would usually already have in place

6796059 archbishop burke has given us a clear vision of what the church expects of us he has modeled what it costs to live according to the truths which the church teaches the best way we can honor the legacy of archbishop burke is to live out that vision and to pray for him daily
6796060 thanks to my brother priests for coming in such goodly numbers to vespers at st ambrose parish on aug 13 and then to dinner at the drury inn to say farewell to archbishop burke it was great to see the warmth of my brother priests toward archbishop burke and to see him mingling during the meal at each of the tables as always he expressed his profound esteem and gratitude for the st louis presbyterate his typical warmth sense of humor and sincerity carried the evening it was sad to think that this was his last gathering with the priests of st louis but the priests gave him a beautiful framed picture of the interior dome of the cathedral basilica as a memento to gaze upon on a cold winter night in rome thanks to all the faithful who filled the cathedral basilica to overflowing this past sunday afternoon for archbishop burkes farewell mass the people seemed to come from every corner in the archdiocese and beyond the missouri bishops together with bishop george lucas and bishop kevin vann were all there the presence of the priests deacons seminarians knights of columbus knights and ladies of the holy sepulchre knights and ladies of malta the knights of peter claver and ladies auxiliary were all there perhaps the most touching moment in his final remarks came when he indicated how proud he was to be called archbishop emeritus of st louis the applause resounded throughout the cathedral basilica at the reception that followed archbishop burke stood for more than four hours to greet well wishers this days events made us all so proud of his accomplishments during the past four and a half years may we continue to pray for him daily thanks to the archdiocesan curia for the warm farewell reception at the cardinal rigali center on tuesday aug 19 over the past several years archbishop burke has established a warm pastoral working relationship with the curia in his expressions of gratitude for the curias response to his leadership he did not disappoint a standing ovation was the least the curia could do to thank him for his warm pastoral leadership over the years the curia gave archbishop burke a beautiful picture of the interior of st vincent de paul chapel at the rigali center to hang in his apartment with the companion piece given by the priests this was the final official farewell for our beloved archbishop burke archbishop burke has given us a clear vision of what the church expects of us he has modeled what it costs to live according to the truths which the church teaches the best way we can honor the legacy of archbishop burke is to live out that vision and to pray for him daily we look back with profound gratitude and wonder we look forward with great trust in the decade of the 1990s pope john paul ii gave us one of the vaticans highest ranking prelates in the person of archbishop justin rigali in the present decade pope benedict has taken our own archbishop burke to fill one of the most important offices in the vatican by naming him the prefect of the supreme tribunal of the apostolic signatura the archdiocese of st louis has done very well under these two very great leaders let us pray for our holy father pope benedict xvi as he discerns the needs of the archdiocese and prayerfully seeks a new archbishop meanwhile let us continue to pray for this archdiocese as it prepares to receive whomever pope benedict chooses to send we have truly been blessed and we will continue to be blessed

6796065 belgium is in danger of falling apart for more than six months the country has been unable to form a government that is able to unite the french speaking walloons 32 and dutch speaking flemish 58 the belgian monarch is desperately trying to stop his subjects from breaking up the state
6796066 w hy rely on london say the scots if brussels offers greater advantages
6796067 perhaps the citizens of belgium do not have enough in common anymore and the flemish and walloons would be better off divorced but one hopes not divorces are never painless and ethnic nationalism unleashes emotions that are undesirable we know what happened when the twin pulls of blood and soil determined european politics before without having intended it the eu now seems to be encouraging the very forces that postwar european unity was designed to contain

6796076 the return leg will be difficult but if we play like we did in the first leg and approach the game with a winners mentality then we will not have any problems winning the supercopa
6796077 we must approach the match with the idea that we have a real chance to win the supercopa
6796078 we have to go there and be ambitious and build on our first leg result rather than just depend on it
6796079 they will definitely play better at home than they did at the mestalla they are now a side that focuses on the aspect of team work but they still have a lot of quality individual players who can turn the game around
6796080 it is important to take things slowly one step at a time it is necessary to remember that we are practically starting from scratch right now we have to focus on the possibility of winning an important title and begin the new league campaign with confidence

6796203 je kunt in sport op een vreedzame manier iets van rivaliteit laten doorklinken ik was op het ek voetbal en zag daar 20 000 mensen in een oranjeshirt en 20 000 mensen in een blauw frans shirt het is geweldig dat die dat allemaal samen beleven het zou saai zijn als iedereen een blauw shirt met europese sterren zou dragen

6796240 quarter of a million dollar competition for gold glory amp sweet sweet cash
6796241 its a pretty good track nice to drive although it was very dirty and slippery in the morning
6796242 we had a very good second session with some quick times and made some strong progress on the setup
6796243 the seamless box is working well and we can push quite hard but lets see what happens for tomorrow and qualifying
6796244 in the afternoon it was better but it was still quite dusty and once you got a little bit off line you got no grip at all
6796245 everything was really as normal with a standard programme with the tyres
6796246 we have some issues with graining as usual but overall i am quite pleased with the day the seamless shift is a very good step and i was happy with the progress
6796247 we were struggling with very low grip this morning and im sure that was the same for everyone out there
6796248 the track is very dusty and if you go offline your tyres are quickly covered in dirt which makes it difficult to be consistent
6796249 we made a lot of changes to the car this afternoon which have proved positive and provided a great deal of useful information to study this evening
6796250 it was nice to do a quick lap at the end on the option tyre hopefully we can further improve the car overnight and be reasonably competitive for qualifying tomorrow
6796251 we had a good morning session and i felt the car was quite well balanced but this afternoon it was almost like i had a completely different car
6796252 we changed some parts for the session and unfortunately they had a real impact on the cars performance which along with some braking concerns meant that we were unable to progress
6796253 i really like the new valencia street circuit as they have done a very good job on the lay out
6796254 the new circuit here in valencia is impressive and the grip levels have been improving throughout the day so the lap times are becoming more representative we had a good morning session and i felt the car was quite well balanced but this afternoon it was almost like i had a completely different car we changed some parts for the session and unfortunately they had a real impact on the cars performance which along with some braking concerns meant that we were unable to progress im confident that we can resolve these concerns overnight and get back on the pace for qualifying tomorrow
6796255 the track is very dirty as it is so new and its very easy to lose a bit of direction as the track improves the car balance changes and the tyres behave differently
6796256 we started the day with poor conditions and very low grip because it was very dusty but it improved during the day now it will be interesting to analyse what we have done and see what the others did i think we can be well prepared for tomorrow
6796257 the track is quite nice and i think they have done a good job with the design at their first attempt of course the grip level will come up over the weekend because by the end of the day the grip on the racing line was good but as soon as you put a wheel off line it was very difficult
6796258 the car is not too bad although i am still struggling a little bit with rear end instability on corner entry and have some traction issues so we still need to fine tune the balance for tomorrow
6796259 theyve done a great job with the track and its a fantastic facility to drive but were not as quick as wed like to be and weve still got a bit of work to do
6796260 the first session was very testing but we improved the car in the second and weve got a lot of data to go through tonight to get ourselves a good grid position tomorrow
6796261 its a typical street circuit in that the rubbered line builds up very quickly but off line you have much less grip
6796262 you dont get that on a normal track so that will make the race interesting if anyone runs wide
6796263 this morning wasnt so good but we worked on the set up and made some improvements for the afternoon lets see what we can do tomorrow
6796264 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6796265 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6796266 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6796276 i think its a bad idea in a way because youd have more people running around drunk
6796277 it would give them more opportunity to do that than when theyre not of age and there would probably be more wrecks
6796278 when people are 18 theyre old enough to move to college and live by themselves so why arent they able to drink
6796279 i know the emotional response of youre old enough to fight in the war but you cant buy beer and thats a point thats difficult to reject
6796280 but alcohol has an effect on some people that maturity alone can manage and i think the maturity assumed by a 21 year old is greater than that of an 18 year old
6796281 id like to see some more data about the law and what the consequences are of what we do
6796282 i would not be in favor of lowering the age without some kind of education along the way i dont think young people understand what the consequences of excessive drinking are
6796283 thats our tradition to discern to talk to have meetings
6796284 puts them at risk for what most people call alcohol poisoning
6796285 the evidence is pretty clear that the earlier you start using alcohol the greater the possibility of your developing problems from alcohol later on

6796300 recu rdese que el juicio a galileo lo llevaba adelante un grupo de gente que afirmaba la existencia de un dios como
6796301 la historia se pronunci a favor de galileo pero sus contempor neos no pod an saberlo
6796302 por su parte el error de los te logos del tiempo de galileo fue el de no hacer una recta interpretaci n de la escritura al quedarse con el sentido literal de sta y al no discernir entre el mbito de la ciencia y el de la revelaci n los cuales si bien no se oponen tampoco deben confundirse
6796303 galileo nunca fue torturado por afirmar que la tierra giraba alrededor del sol fue condenado a formalem carcerem una especie de reclusi n domiciliaria
6796304 lo detuvieron lo humillaron le hicieron desdecirse de sus afirmaciones y a n as lo condenaron a reclusi n domiciliaria pero no lo torturaron y nosotros que no agradecemos
6796305 a galileo se le juzg no por su tesis cient fica sino por decir que la biblia estaba equivocada al hablar de que
6796306 curiosa forma de defender a la icar del abuso de poder del que se le acusa
6796307 los hechos de 1616 acabaron con dos actos extra judiciales por una parte se public un decreto de la congregaci n del ndice fechado el 5 de marzo de 1616 por el que se incluyeron en el ndice de libros prohibidos tres libros acerca de las revoluciones del can nigo polaco nicol s cop rnico publicado en 1543 donde se expon a la teor a helioc ntrica de modo cient fico un comentario del agustino espa ol diego de z iga publicado en toledo en 1584 y en roma en 1591 donde se interpretaba alg n pasaje de la biblia de acuerdo con el copernicanismo y un op sculo del carmelita italiano paolo foscarini publicado en 1615 donde se defend a que el sistema de cop rnico no est en contra de la sagrada escritura quedaba afectado por las mismas censuras cualquier otro libro que ense ara las mismas doctrinas el motivo que se daba en el decreto para esas censuras era que la doctrina que defiende que la tierra se mueve y el sol est en reposo es falsa y completamente contraria a la sagrada escritura por otra parte se amonest personalmente a galileo para que abandonara la teor a helioc ntrica y se abstuviera de defenderla el op sculo de foscarini fue prohibido absolutamente en cambio los libros de cop rnico y de z iga solamente fueron suspendidos hasta que se corrigieran algunos pasajes en el caso de z iga lo que deber a modificarse era muy breve en el caso de cop rnico se trataba de diversos pasajes donde hab a que explicar que el heliocentrismo no era una teor a verdadera sino s lo un artificio til para los c lculos astron micos de hecho esas correcciones se prepararon y se aprobaron al cabo de cuatro a os en 1620
6796308 en la poca de galileo la iglesia fue mucho m s fiel a la raz n que el propio galileo el proceso contra galileo fue razonable y justo

6796492 we hebben hier als ploeg een sterke prestatie neergezet we waren de beste ploeg en we hebben de beste kansen gehad helaas voor ons viel de verdiende gelijkmaker niet en moesten we zelfs met een 2 0 achterstand gaan rusten wat de ploeg na de rust heeft laten zien was mooi mijn jongens hebben het hoofd niet laten hangen maar hebben er alles aan gedaan om terug in de wedstrijd te komen dat toont onze mentale sterkte we speelden met veel lef en enthousiasme helaas ontbrak het ons weeral aan effici ntie het verhaal van ons toernooi eigenlijk

6796505 nulla di pi comune per esempio che trovare un critico moderno che scriva cose di questo genere il cristianesimo fu soprattutto un movimento ascetico una corsa al deserto un rifugio nel chiostro una rinuncia alla vita e alla felicit esso non fu che parte di una fosca e inumana reazione contro la natura stessa un odio pel corpo un aborrimento delluniverso materiale una specie di suicidio universale dei sensi e anche dellindividuo derivava da un fanatismo orientale come quello dei fachiri ed era basato su un pessimismo orientale che considerava lesistenza stessa come un male in tutto questoa cosa straordinaria che tutto verissimo vero in ogni particolare con la sola differenza che attribuito erroneamente a chi non ci ha niente a che vedere non vero della chiesa vero delle eresie condannate dalla chiesa come se uno fosse obbligato a scrivere unanalisi degli errori e del malgoverno dei ministri di giorgio iii con la piccola inesattezza che tutto il racconto si riferisse a giorgio washington o come se uno facesse un elenco dei delitti dei bolscevichi con la sola variante di attribuirli allo zar la chiesa primitiva fu s ascetica ma in dipendenza di una filosofia totalmente diversa da quella di una guerra alla vita e alla natura la quale realmente esistette nel mondo e basterebbe che i critici sapessero dove andare a cercarla

6796507 the product was developed after intense research among our customers who wanted a product that is easy to understand and buy besides including the best of the coverage the challenge was to devise such a product that it includes all the features and make it available at an affordable price in order to address this we had to change the process of buying itself so as to live up to its name of insta insure at the same time ensure strict controls to prevent misuse and mis selling

6796570 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan
6796571 his dedication to his soldiers and this mission was second to none this was his third tour in afghanistan and his reputation for succeeding at any task no matter how difficult was well known
6796572 the engineer corps held a special place in his heart he said
6796573 he loved to fix things and help anyone complete their task his work made him happy and his enthusiasm was infectious to all those around him
6796574 his commitment to what was right and just inspired all those that had the privilege of knowing him he let his friends and family know his desire to serve in this mission may that be a comfort to all who mourn for him
6796575 as we prepare to carry our dear friends home let us remember the joy and zeal that these men poured into this mission
6796576 it is now our job to ensure that the work they have sacrificed for is brought to completion may each of us walk proudly on the bridge these men have sacrificed their lives to build
6796577 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandaha
6796578 the taliban are against things they are not for anything they are against human rights they are against education they are against health care they are against women they are just against human decency
6796579 if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6796580 umamin na lang daw kami para makauwi na they told us to just admit it so we could come home
6796581 mercy or justice we were told that if we choose to fight the case in court and deny the charges our abusive employers will file another false accusation
6796582 so i begged them to let me go instead and send me home
6796583 experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias only increases the danger facing civilians
6796584 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians
6796585 the government does not know who is the rebel and the civilian they are hard to identify it would have been good if the government had an efficient intelligence system
6796586 if they milf want war the government must take it to them so that civilians would not think of defending themselves
6796587 at this moment i can tell you that not a single russian soldier or piece of military hardware remains in the town of gori
6796588 some two hours ago they started their withdrawal from checkpoints that were set up on nearby mountains then around half an hour ago the last checkpoint was removed in gori too
6796589 in short were going home peace to all countries what else can i say theres no need for war there should be friendship
6796590 were just doing our bit were following orders were leaving here now
6796591 the officer explained the situation this way at the roki tunnel 150 officers of the fsb russias federal security service are searching the columns of vehicles very thoroughly and it takes a lot of time
6796592 theyre doing this in order to make sure that the soldiers dont take any looted goods or weapons or maybe even money that dont belong to them so everyone is being checked and as the officer said that is why this process of withdrawal has dragged on for so long
6796593 in order to stop groups of looters and prevent the delivery of unaccounted for weapons and ammunition
6796594 18 peacekeeping surveillance posts have been set up along the administrative border between georgia and south ossetia
6796595 units of the georgian armed forces are concentrating in central georgia restoring their combat capability and preparing for further actions
6796596 georgian forces are carrying out reconnaissance into the character and direction of the actions of russian troops and south ossetian formations and are preparing military actions in the georgia south ossetia conflict zone
6796597 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara
6796598 so if we go with that agreement it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops will have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
6796599 as far as i know senaki would not be in any buffer zone
6796600 senaki is about 40 kilometers away from the border with abkhazia there is i believe a 14 kilometer zone on either side of the administrative border between abkhazia and the rest of georgia the russians definitely have the right to patrol that area under the old agreements senaki is way away from there what the russians are saying is that it falls into the zone of responsibility of the peacekeepers i havent heard them refer to a specific document that gives them the right to stay in senaki or poti
6796601 there is going to be a huge need for western aid when the russians finally do ship out and it looks like it is going to come
6796602 if the aid comes fast if it is significant then i think president mikheil saakashvili may be able to turn around and say look this was always coming anyway
6796603 if he can say all those things then hes in a stronger position but a lot will depend on the speed and quantity of the aid
6796604 i invite you to read my real life experience with starting an income online and the good and perhaps not so good experiences i faced until finally
6796605 if the major political party believes that he is the most talented person then he is the most eligible person for this post
6796606 now it depends on him whether he himself becomes president or nominates someone else
6796607 im just a big believer in you must love yourself before you can love anybody else and i think for me that breeds the most inspired relationships
6796608 its hard for me to have any proclamation about the right kind of love or how to love because relationships are so complicated and there are so many ways to love on one hand theres obsessive love and committed love and the love that friends just have for one another
6796609 i think its a joke we know they cant raise the money from everything weve heard
6796610 they are misleading the market its about time they put up or shut up their original press release has been blown out of the water
6796611 the takeover panel should do something about it gfk should explain themselves they have misled the market and been economical with the actualit it was disingenuous and outrageous to put that release out
6796612 gfk is in discussions with a serious and substantial investor and talks are progressing very well
6796613 all is fair in love and war but theyre not doing the business much good

6796620 we investigated it so thoroughly beyond any expectation you might have i can tell you
6796621 i dont think this story is anything like the way theyve portrayed it i think this guy chose to do this
6796622 given the site of the attack he was making a political statement
6796623 i think its a joke we know they cant raise the money from everything weve heard
6796624 they are misleading the market its about time they put up or shut up their original press release has been blown out of the water
6796625 the takeover panel should do something about it gfk should explain themselves they have misled the market and been economical with the actualit it was disingenuous and outrageous to put that release out

6796628 one of the most common behavioral changes cancer survivors make sometimes without a doctors advice often on their own is using dietary supplements in hopes of bolstering their health
6796629 still its unclear whether supplements really help keep cancer survivors healthier or put them at further risk they like many other people today use the internet and you can find a lot of false hope out there with supplements targeted at cancer survivors
6796630 in our study we see people taking supplements who have good diets and who are relatively healthy while they may need a particular vitamin because they dont get enough of it they may not need a multivitamin or supplement because of the increased risk of cancer recurrence or secondary cancer
6796631 he silva might not be on that card though but i really dont know for sure now but im thinking hes not going to be on that at this point
6796632 i highly respect the club the players and especially the fans whove always treated me well but thats not my objective i have an offer from chelsea which is good for me and the club i dream of playing in the english league
6796633 chelsea have a great squad and a great team my objective is to play there ive got nothing against real madrid but i hope to resolve this situation as soon as possible
6796634 i want to be the best player in the world and that isnt possible at real madrid ive come to an end of a cycle ive played three seasons at real madrid ive given my all ive scored goals ive won two leagues and thats not easy i think that my time here has now come to an end
6796635 i thought the game would be more of an action game until i played it

6796654 everybodys watching whats going on in beijing right now with the olympics think about the amount of money that china has spent on infrastructure
6796655 ignores how those structures were assembled the source and conditions of the labor the lack of pollution controls in beijing and throughout china the many complaints that chinese infrastructure outside the olympics zone remains shoddy the recent record of chinese manufacturing scandals including the heparin fiasco which killed many americans and of course the catastrophe brought about by chinese building standards in the region rocked by the recent earthquake
6796656 severe power shortages across china especially in the manufacturing hub and export engine of guangdong are expected to add further pressure on exports in the second half of the year
6796657 scores of chinese air passengers have smashed computers and desks and clashed with police after a night stranded at an airport without accommodation state media said frustration at mysterious delays diversions and cancellations have at times boiled over into violence at chinese airports as passengers try to storm grounded aircraft and police are brought in to keep the peace there have also been cases in which passengers after delayed arrivals have refused to get off the planes in protest

6796659 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6796660 my dad was praying for me every time i was playing one of the games which could last one to two hours each over a two day tournament weekend if i was in a difficult situation i would stop to think knowing because of the prayer god would give me wisdom
6796661 chess has taught me about prayer practice patience and making friends making friends from different parts of the state and country has been a lot of fun
6796662 when he was four i showed him how to play chess but i pulled my hair out because i didnt think he was getting it
6796663 but when he was five his mom bought him chess for the computer and he was really interested in it
6796664 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out its not that katie s bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter

6796677 lament vel observar que os atletas da capital do estado diferente dos friburguenses s o assediados por diversas escolas interessadas em formar suas equipes para os anos seguintes com ofertas de bolsas de estudo e outras formas de incentivo talvez um bom exemplo para entendermos por que nova friburgo ainda necessita de bom desempenho em v rias modalidades esportivas
6796678 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6796679 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6796680 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6796681 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation
6796682 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6796683 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6796684 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6796685 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6796686 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6796687 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6796688 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6796689 if you trust every web site but not a government
6796690 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6796691 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6796692 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6796693 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6796694 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6796695 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6796696 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6796697 we wanted to do something to help the family out
6796698 the involvement of an extremely high profile celebrity in the horrific sport of dog fighting prompted universal public outrage and condemnation
6796699 this case will forever remain a pivotal point in the history of animal welfare in this country and the world
6796700 there will be something for everyone during the all day event
6796701 we will be a beehive of activity and fun all day
6796702 these documents existed on a state wide website and now they dont exist and this change has taken place recently i was interested because these were documents that no one could find if theres information to be found on the internet im a citizen journalist it was a challenge
6796703 the listing in there quite clearly is he kexins birth date january 1 1994
6796704 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say i want other people to know that 16 is my real age
6796705 these people pay nothing into the system and take everything out of the system
6796706 we have to take care of our own citizens before we take care of foreign nationals

6796709 its a contradiction if you find that there is no discrimination implicitly that means there was a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for the reduction in pay
6796710 after her pay was reduced there was about a 20 000 difference between todaro and the only male associate at the firm
6796711 certainly one difference between the two is that ms moscarelli was fired and ms todaro was not her salary was cut by 25 percent

6796722 i cannot fault former mayor pe a for not having a crystal ball in the early 90s and being able to foresee the current state of eco hysteria
6796723 but at least he should urge delegates to get to the convention by rickshaw or pack mule or some other means than carbon spewing cars
6796724 but its not about the environment at all its about growing government and raising taxes

6796726 we looked into simply extending runways into the rocky mountain arsenal but that didnt solve the noise problem
6796727 airplanes were getting bigger and faster so safety became an increasingly serious issue
6796728 pe a was the mayor and he should have worked to instead expand and improve stapleton
6796729 it certainly needed more parking and it also needed another longer runway but that could have easily been done dia was a make work new deal style government boondoggle pushed by a guy who thought that a big government project was the way to deal with a recession

6796817 the mechanic suffered an electric shock after touching the sidepod and steering wheel of the car there was a high frequency ac voltage between these contact points the cause of which has been traced back to the kers control unit and a sporadic capacitive coupling from the high voltage network to the 12 volt network the voltage ran through the wiring of the 12 volt network to the steering wheel and through the carbon chassis back to the control unit
6796818 no as only a small amount of energy can be transferred through this capacitive coupling effect however the energy is sufficient to cause an extremely painful reaction the driver was insulated against the car by his racing overalls and gloves and therefore not in any danger
6796819 it was not possible initially to reproduce the capacitive coupling effect in the car as the problem was caused by a sporadic error in the control unit due to the extremely high frequency of the voltage in the steering wheel the safety mechanisms and data recordings did not pick up on the error in the absence of data all the theoretical possibilities had to be systematically investigated and analysed in tests furthermore the capacitive coupling effect only occurs under certain conditions without the option of driving the kers test car used in jerez again we had to reconstruct these conditions we also had to develop a model to be installed between the steering wheel and sidepod which replicated the characteristics of the human body as an electric transfer element
6796820 in addition to the measures required to tackle the issue at hand the extremely far reaching analysis we conducted also gave rise to other recommendations which are of great value for the development of electric kers systems among the measures arrived at are changes in the design of the control unit to avoid capacitive coupling effects extended monitoring functions for high frequencies and a conductive connection of the chassis components to avoid any electric potential
6796821 we have already handed over this safety analysis complete with measures and recommendations to the fia and will also make our findings available to the other teams at the next meeting of the technical working group

6796825 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6796826 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the gas to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6796827 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe
6796828 took my family to the crayola musuem in easton pa
6796829 i always try to take pictures of signs to identify in a slideshow where a group of pictures were taken
6796830 the museum has this interesting sign which i thought would be a candidate for grab shots after i saw the result the crayola museum features a number of hands on activities with crayola products along with great activities for children and a demonstration of how the crayons are made
6796831 i took the picture from the second floor of the parking garage across the street to flatten the angle looking up at the sign i used my canon rebel xti with the canon f 1 4 50 mm lens considering that most of the days pictures were to be taken inside i gave myself the assignment to film the whole day with just the 50mm lens in this case i had to crop down on the sign because i could not zoom out to take in the full display however i think the tighter shot heighens the sense that the box of crayons is tumbling out from the sky

6796868 conditions for soybean foliar diseases have been favorable and a number of diseases will be more evident although recent conditions have been good for rust development in north carolina the rust spore production south of north carolina remains minimal so there are few sources of spores at this time

6796905 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6796906 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6796907 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6796908 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6796909 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6796910 i dont care if its unconstitutional it sends a message
6796911 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6796912 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6796913 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6796914 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6796930 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6796931 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6796932 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6796933 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6796934 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6796935 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6796936 who are open to doing something on the production side
6796937 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6796938 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6796939 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6796940 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6796941 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6796942 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6796943 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6796944 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
6796945 ils demandaient 1 300 millions alors que nous avons acquis les deux autres qui repr sentent pratiquement la m me capacit que cemex pour 819 millions de dollars
6796946 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6796947 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6796948 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6796949 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6796950 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6796951 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6796952 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6796953 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6796954 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6796955 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6796956 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6796960 snowballed into full scale anti india protests this month boosting separatists who want indias only muslim majority region to secede
6796961 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6796962 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6796963 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6796964 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6796965 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6796966 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6796967 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6796968 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6796969 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6796970 in classical music the concert experience is this very formalized thing
6796971 you dress up nicely you might shower before you go its a special effort and the space is usually gorgeous with this kind of tour theres an idea that the music is a continuum of the day and a more social interaction than not this tour is more about staying on peoples floors and peoples couches and being more casual about what it means to make music
6796972 ive been watching nico for a couple of years now
6796973 he comes from the classical world but he really gets the emotional quality of these musicians this is the first time hes done a tour like this and theres this feeling that this is a very unique thing we may not be seeing much in the future

6796977 he was so refreshing willing to jump into whatever interests him hes not limiting himself
6796978 every six months i think of a new way to describe it
6796979 it sounds like what happens if you squeeze the air out of something its the very last sound that comes out the only reason you can hear it is because its heavily amplified to me its as if you play a pump organ and you let your foot off the pedal his voice is definitely an interesting thing and its something you have to reckon with
6796980 the implementation of this new manufacturing process was done intelligently with both quality and cost in mind

6796984 we are proud of the highly skilled and dedicated employees at chryslers newark plant
6796985 the employees at newark assembly continue to work hard to ensure the success of this new product line and we are looking forward to these new hybrid vehicles being available to the public
6796986 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6796987 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6796988 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6796989 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6796990 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6796991 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
6796992 they seem to think our community is their open job site
6796993 it is their contention they are not required to do so its our contention that they are
6796994 if we were going to have our landscape dotted with refrigerator size boxes we should have some control over them
6796995 we asked them to move certain locations and they voluntarily did
6796996 thats because tommy girl ordered his alien subjects to sell this shit out tom not tommy girl tom from myspace
6796997 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6796998 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6796999 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6797000 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6797001 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6797002 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6797006 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6797007 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6797008 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6797009 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6797010 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6797011 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6797012 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6797013 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6797014 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6797015 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6797016 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6797017 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6797018 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6797019 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6797020 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6797021 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6797022 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6797023 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6797024 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6797025 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6797070 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
6797071 topless modeling contest that among other things involves a section with a banana
6797072 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
6797073 because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow
6797074 i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency
6797075 sen mccain has been very honest about his life and about not only who he was but i think very refreshingly who he is
6797076 and the one thing i find about sen mccain is that he is a man of honor
6797077 they dont want to get into a discussion of character and background they are opening a door that they will not be able to close they are putting on the table issues and personalities that they do not want to discuss

6797091 not surprisingly some of those who signed up early on were those who needed health care the most and who had neglected health issues for too long insurers have found their own cost of coverage soaring
6797092 government of course which is picking up the tab both for masshealth and for those subsidies is struggling too
6797093 its also critical to make sure this program doesnt become a victim of that success and further victimize those segments of the community business health providers and insurers who make it work
6797094 there had to be a reasonable way to help home sellers and still keep our area clear of unsafe unsightly and unlawful sign clutter

6797134 while there are some notable exceptions many entrepreneurs still see environmental initiatives as representing a cost to the business rather than an opportunity
6797135 the reality is that there are two broad reasons why entrepreneurs should have green issues firmly on their agenda
6797136 secondly the growing pressure on businesses and individuals to reduce their environmental impact inevitably brings opportunities for new products and services to help them meet this goal the innovative nature of entrepreneurs combined with their agility to respond to market opportunities quicker than larger corporates should place them in an enviable position to capitalise on environmental challenges
6797137 we viewed the environmental pressures to reduce greenhouse gases and carbon emissions as providing a business opportunity we have established a business which wins at all levels recycling waste generating renewable energy and making farming greener and more sustainable
6797138 placing equal importance on being environmentally and commercially responsible not only helps us win business but also makes biogen an attractive employer which has achieved external recognition and praise from government and environmental groups

6797189 i just want you to know i wasnt doing this on purpose
6797190 i really need the structure she has at the jimenezs
6797191 its still like a home environment without being surrounded by all the doors and classroom structure like at the bigger daycares
6797192 i would like you to change the zoning regulations to support a childcare center in a home where the owner does not live 24 7
6797193 if everyone in the neighborhood supports it it shouldnt be a problem
6797194 shes been the best daycare person ive ever seen my daughter taylor has been with her over a year now the impact on her would be detrimental my daughter is attached to her its just not a daycare shes really family to us she teaches the children they dont just get to run around and do whatever
6797195 i take care of my kids these daycares are what allow me to do that because they allow me an open range of when i can work i would like you guys to change it to allow it as long as your neighbors are ok with it and homeowner or landowner is ok with running the business

6797213 we have a lot of guys that i would just term basketball players
6797214 i think lou williams is a hell of a basketball player i really like the way the kid plays
6797215 when this happens you end up getting an early fall infection of wheat streak which is devastating to the wheat crop
6797216 neither the mite nor the disease can be treated so the producer cant fix the situation once it occurs
6797217 so many people did not do that last year and that was one of the things that set up the disastrous wheat year last year
6797218 everybody had drought but the fields infected by wheat streak were much much worse at harvest time
6797219 even some irrigated producers had significant losses because of it and the combination of other diseases
6797220 we know there is not much you can do about crp conservation reserve program grasses but there is something to do about the volunteer wheat
6797221 if you have a strip of volunteer wheat in the ditch around your field i would get rid of it there too
6797222 once you are infected in the early fall and the virus gets a chance to get established the virus is not going to go away and will likely only get worse
6797223 any inputs to fall infected wheat need to be carefully considered once you know you have an infection
6797224 you cant remind producers too many times how important this simple wheat disease management practice can be to their bottom line
6797225 although volunteer wheat is the most favorable host for the wheat curl mite we cannot rule out barley corn triticale rye and other grasses or grassy weeds
6797226 these crops also can potentially serve as a green bridge for the wheat curl mite to survive from one season to another
6797227 therefore destroying the host plants for the wheat curl mite is the action to take until plant breeders can come up with good resistant varieties against these viruses
6797228 they wont let me protest then they sentence me to a year labour camp i am really mad

6797236 this includes increasing turbine capacity from 1 75 mw to 2 mw for a total of 40 mw which necessitated
6797237 this ailing patient the u s cotton sector shows every sign of a great recovery it just may need at least another year to recuperate
6797238 while the long term outlook for the cotton sector in the united states is favorable the sector may still endure some pain before things improve
6797239 acres in the delta region are likely to see a larger decrease approximately 30 percent a change which would see that region losing over half its cotton area in just two years
6797240 despite the relatively low acreage in the long term the u s cotton sector is likely to strengthen largely due to changes in the global sector the u s cotton sector is likely to improve as major global cotton producers such as china and india increasingly divert more acreage into food production to keep pace with rising incomes and populations
6797241 while cotton production in africa continues to have great potential growth is slow and volatility is ever present
6797242 additionally with low yields compared to world averages the region may benefit from increased international focus in terms of multilateral agronomic development and an increased focus from the private sector outside the region that is seeking to develop new resources
6797243 the main reason for the success of indias cotton program has been the implementation of a government program that targeted improvements in seeds extension services marketing infrastructure and processing facilities
6797244 assuming that current trends in terms of strong demand and upward price pressure for grains and oilseeds continues into 2009 it would be reasonable to predict that 2009 10 u s cotton acreage is unlikely to see a major increase if any increase at all
6797245 however as the economic slowdown eases textile demand is likely to strengthen again and with it demand for cotton
6797246 so as global cotton prices react to any future cut in supply u s cotton growers will be ideally placed to benefit

6797314 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6797315 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided
6797316 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6797317 the commentary tells me that rates are on hold until they see some blue skies through this financial storm
6797318 inflation is not out of control but its clearly drifting away
6797319 with financial conditions already quite fragile the sudden unanticipated failure of bear stearns would have led to a sharp unwinding of positions in those markets that could have severely shaken the confidence of market participants
6797320 the broader economy could hardly have remained immune from such severe financial disruptions

6797373 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all types of cancer combined when compared to treatment with a placebo
6797374 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6797375 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment ldl cholesterol
6797376 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6797377 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher ldl levels
6797378 this is especially true of cancers involving the blood cell system but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6797379 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers

6797425 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university

6797456 in the 1980s somebody came to me and said that there was a new creature in the river nile
6797457 after two days of examination we determined it was the fresh water crayfish
6797458 he bought what he thought were shrimp eggs to hatch in his fish farm
6797459 when they hatched into crayfish they ate all the fish then burrowed through mud partitions into neighboring fish containments and ate those fish too
6797460 we must give more attention to public awareness and the importance of the crayfish to make the people of the nile like it and put it everywhere
6797461 we put some fish lamb plants dead chicken we found the first thing the crayfish selected was the snail because the shell is very thin

6797474 a species of red algae for instance produces under increased ultraviolet radiation less red light harvesting proteins thus decreasing the absorption of radiation the typical red colour of the alga fades and the plant gets white tips
6797475 the algae additionally produce substances which react similar to melanin in human skins mycosporin amino acids maa
6797476 we examine the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on algae and their protective mechanisms
6797477 our investigations show that the distribution of certain species of brown algae is inhibited by the climate of ultraviolet radiation the algae are displaced into deeper water layers if ultraviolet radiation increases
6797478 we want to observe the development of marine coastal ecosystems in the face of global climate change not only an increased ultraviolet radiation plays a decisive role but also the water temperature which has been increased by the greenhouse effect this increase in temperature can particularly be felt on spitsbergen in the atlantic sector of the arctic

6797487 obviously hes somebody who changed the game for players and definitely myself who came in 20 years after he came into the front office
6797488 if you look at what hes done and if you really understand the game and know history and do the research of how it was before gene upshaw it was pretty bad he built on it every year you have strikes and maybe people that have been upset with him in recent years about retired players and how they were being treated but for us players in the game today you have to respect him and understand how much he meant to the game
6797489 i actually had a couple of conversations with him got to know him a little bit he was a great person and i was saddened by that my thoughts go out to his family and his friends its a sad situation but hopefully his family can recover from that
6797490 i think the guys that work with him closely are really shocked by this news
6797491 i came in this morning at 8 a m and a teammate of mine mentioned he saw something on msnbc and i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden
6797492 i tried to search online and find some more information and it was later revealed it was true it was very sad to hear
6797493 his service as executive director of the nflpa is a stamp that all of us are proud of
6797494 he certainly has been a rock for us from a players standpoint and we are deeply saddened about his passing our hearts go out to his family first and to his former teammates friends and co workers
6797495 i got to know gene through my years of being a player rep i cant stand here and say i knew him extremely well personally but having worked with him i know that he is a man that was very well respected for a lot of reasons certainly for his 15 year career with the oakland raiders where he won two super bowls and went to the pro bowl seven times that record speaks for itself and certainly what hes done for the p a and the players now i know there have been a lot of complaints with some disgruntled players with some of the things but i think those are all things that have to do with personal issues when you look at the facts at what gene upshaw did for this organization its pretty awesome
6797496 the national football league is deeply saddened by the loss of gene upshaw
6797497 it is a shock to most of us not even knowing that he was ill he is a hall of famer he has been in the position of leadership for the players association for 25 years he is a guy that has earned his stripes so to speak and just again very very difficult to learn of this news and not even know there was anything wrong
6797498 gene was an outstanding advocate for the players and he made many great contributions to our sport he was also a good and decent man he will be sorely missed
6797499 gene will always be remembered for his great contributions to the game and our league both as a player and as the leader of the players association
6797500 we are all indebted to him for his guidance direction and his vision
6797501 a fundamentalist mind is a mind that has become rigid first the heart closes then the mind becomes hardened into a view then you can justify your hatred of another human being because of what they represent and what they say and do

6797503 the reason im writing all this about patrick and i am only scratching the surface is to tell you that he is dealing with a medical condition for which im asking your help on august 15 patrick underwent surgery for a long standing problem with his spine the surgery itself went well but two days later patrick suffered a complication that necessitated further surgery on august 18 he has been in icu at eden medical center in castro valley california since then and remains there although much improved patrick welcomes healing given what ive told you about him and that you have a photo and know where is is i ask that you remember him in your prayers and rituals light candles appeal to his lady brigit and do whatever else you can to hasten patricks relief from extreme pain and his ultimate recovery
6797504 years ago i would have worried about what people thought and would not have told anyone i was a witch now there are so many people like me that i simply think that the people who matter dont mind and the people who mind dont matter
6797505 anyone hoping to see animal sacrifices or disemboweling during pagan pride day saturday will be greatly disappointed say two spokespeople for the pagan church which is hosting the nanaimo event at kin hut park in departure bay

6797514 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
6797515 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
6797516 this is significant in two ways one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of embryo derived stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6797517 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6797518 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6797519 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6797520 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6797521 it is a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for a long time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of war
6797522 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
6797523 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
6797524 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
6797525 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
6797526 trichoplax is an ancient lineage good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
6797527 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
6797528 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
6797529 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
6797530 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
6797531 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
6797532 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
6797533 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature

6797563 its a fact that they have publicly said that its impossible the entire coalition of opposition will not garner or deny them a two thirds majority in fact they were so confident of wresting over kelantan we have proven them wrong the last time and we can prove them wrong again
6797564 having a person who is able to speak in many dialects is a good thing for the multiracial country but the policy of barisan nasional especially umno does not reflect that so a persons ability would not be able to bring a difference unless there is a policy change i dont think he is going to bring about any policy change
6797565 from the direction of gori three armored vehicles are moving in our direction plus two trucks loaded with personnel and they passed us and went in the direction of igoeti i asked one of the russian officers at the checkpoint who was wearing a peacekeeping armband and he said they dont intend to stay for long when i asked him to be more concrete he said we are waiting for orders i cant tell you anything my boss is general borisov
6797566 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone
6797567 borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara so if we go with that agreement it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops will have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints

6797602 if abortion is murder and i believe it is the penalty for murder from almost any evangelical theology is death
6797603 believers have to stand for what they believe is right were commanded in the scripture to pray that gods kingdom would come on earth as it is in heaven and thats my prayer what we pray for surely were commanded to work for
6797604 cor creates documents that provide the philosophical foundation for action
6797605 a number of items that we think ought to happen political involvement educational involvement and well regulated militias locally
6797606 we believe that god has given the bible as a rule book for all society christian and non christian alike
6797607 i concur with most of the reconstructionist matters i am trying to help rebuild the society on the word of god and loosely that would be a reconstructionist orientation in anybodys book
6797608 the bible had something like eleven reasons for capital punishment and murder was one and homosexuality and rape and kidnapping were some others the actual punishments we dont have agreement on but we think that homosexuality and abortion and pornography should be outlawed
6797609 for example in santa clara county there are about 14 cities including san jose the big city we think its very possible by the year 2000 to have christians mature biblically literate gain the majority of seats in all the city councils in our county plus the board of
6797610 thats one step the political scene thatll be the easiest
6797611 and the facts are we have enough christians to totally politically by vote overpower any other groups of minorities if we would just do it we have the majority vote we are the largest minority
6797612 it is the goal of a number of us to try to christianize the state of grimstead explained his viewpoint on church state separation
6797613 the numbers may not be large as yet but they dont have to be because if you develop an ideologically committed cadre of well trained leadership it doesnt matter what your numbers are because youve got ministers of congregations you have people who have a vision for the long haul yeah therell be flakes but theyll also have some serious contenders who will know how to package themselves to get some county council seats local sheriffs and that kind of stuff there are so few people who vote in those kinds of elections you turn out a couple of churches full of people and away you go
6797614 our state legislators will discover they can no longer write off the concerns of conservative christian families
6797615 the christian community got it backwards in the nineteen eighties we tried to charge when we should have been focusing on the states the real battles of concern to christians are in neighborhoods school boards city councils and state legislatures
6797616 a nuts and bolts manual on how to start a coalition how to fund raise for your candidate how to back a candidate how to groom a candidate how to deal with the media for their candidate how to be a candidate and how to canvass your voters

6797790 in qualifying we were the slowest car down the straight and struggled for straight line performance but the older engine which should be knackered and good for nothing did the job and was good for a 53 8 which was one of the quicker times but by then it was too late as id been lingering in the middle where all the shit is kicking off i tried to keep my nose clean and we have to be happy with where we ended up in the final race as it is hard starting where we did

6797795 not too long not too short just right ok enough with generalities for the moment and lets get down to some particulars the dinovo edges box is extremely attractive albeit a bit large considering the svelteness of its contents when first unboxed the dinovos surface and that of the charging dock are covered with a thin protective clear plastic film some users might opt to leave it in place but if you do youll miss out on the full aesthetic joy of this unit the extreme glossy black reflectiveness of this unit made me apprehensive about it showing smudges dust and fingerprints but actually its less of a problem than i had imagined indeed my deduction would be that it will age more gracefully than my poor old white kensington slimtype has the latter now stained and yellowed with the labels beginning to wear off the most frequently used keys logitech thoughtfully includes a soft polishing cloth with the dinovo to help keep it spotless so to speak actually the board is so lovely to look at you do feel a bit inhibited about using it it inspires you to make a bit of effort to keep it looking spiffy incidentally dont go overboard with the spiffiness logitech warns somewhat ominously to not use soap or any other type of cleaning product on this board and to stick with the supplied soft cloth upon unpacking the box you will find the keyboard module and charging dock module an ac power adapter for the charger a cd with the logitech control center driver software installer about which more in a moment the aforementioned polishing cloth and a small manual which is very attractively presented and covers all the basics of setting up and using this keyboard another classy touch is that the latter three items are packed in a discrete envelope printed to match the box design theme the dinovo is supposed to come with its battery at least partly charged so you can get up and running without delay i didnt bother checking that out and charged it before i put it to work to charge just plug the power adapter into the dock and drop the keyboard module into its storage slot two electrical contacts connect by default and youre good to go basic keyboard functions are supported by os x without the logitech control center drivers installed but if you want to get the full functionality like the fn key shift configurations and the touchdisc scrolling functions youll need to install the drivers which requires a restart of the mac the general control center pane control center is accessed through the os x system preferences includes a battery charges level gauge and several configuration options the keys pane lets you assign custom functions to the f keys the touchdisc pane does likewise for the touch disc its all pretty intuitive the dinovo edge has an 84 key qwerty layout as opposed to 105 keys on a standard desktop keyboard with 18x18mm keys and in appearance other than color it reminds me a lot of the keyboard in my 17

6798000 extendicare facilities sound warm and fuzzy on paper the type of place that you would want your parents or grandparents to be if they needed care you couldnt provide them yourself
6798001 the reality is that these facilities have a long record of excessive and repeated citations by the washington department of social and health services for providing substandard care and care that violates the rights of residents
6798002 basically we believe that extendicares corporate strategy and policy is to maximize profits at the expense of the elderly and vulnerable people it claims to serve
6798003 we all know that there is a direct correlation between elder abuse and staffing levels in my opinion the extendicare facilities in washington are elder abuse cases waiting to happen its just a matter of whose parents or grandparents are going to be the victims
6798004 in the midst of an uncertain economic environment we point to our improving net interest margin growth in our loan portfolio and successful expense control as indicators of our progress notwithstanding all other factors opportunities for prudent and profitable growth do exist in this market and we are moving to leverage them to our advantage
6798005 the olympic committees decision to create the new sponsorship category of official language training and testing supplier in 2007 and invite aifly to fill this role was one of the most important decisions in ensuring the success of the beijing olympics the training and testing services that aifly provided to olympic volunteers over the years leading up to the games were invaluable to our preparations
6798006 once we were asked to take on this role we determined that considering the limited time scale and complexity of the training program that was needed it would be most effective to focus on training volunteers in language and skills that they would be most likely to encounter and need to use effectively during the olympic and paralympic games
6798007 we use different training methods and focus on different content depending on the role and location that each volunteer will be assigned during the olympics so for example for medical aid volunteers we emphasized role playing and maintained small groups of between 4 and 10 students during training
6798008 last may i participated in the language training for college volunteers
6798009 ive been to six olympic games the beijing olympics is much better than i expected all the volunteers are very kind theyve given me a lot of help most of them can speak english fluently i did not expect their language skills to be so strong or to provide such professional service

6798018 rubens is a team mate i think he is fantastic has done a great job and he gives excellent feedback probably better than any other driver out there
6798019 so im sure whatever the teams decision is and if they are talking to him then it will be a very difficult decision for the team to make

6798063 abbiamo gi visto questo film scrive kerry riferendosi al libro scritto da corsi durante la sua corsa alla presidenza nel 2004 i repubblicani senza idee iniziano a proporre una campagna elettorale fatta di attacchi personali e mistificazioni questi attacchi vanno denunciati e condannati senza pero che questo conceda loro spazio e visibilit nei media dobbiamo combattere questi metodi in qulasiasi modo possiamo
6798064 non so risponde non riesco ancora a pensare a un presidente nero in questa america
6798065 quello che pi mi ha impressionato finora di questa campagna elettorale sono proprio i giovani che qui a san francisco e nel resto della california si stanno impegnando tantissimo per obama come non vedevo fare da tempo da un punto di vista politico si vede che nutrono quella speranza di cui obama spesso parla una speranza che dovrebbe alimentare e contagiare parecchi americani per fare in modo che succeda quello che anchio mi auguro che accada

6798082 its impossible to imagine that anyone in the cuban leadership would want to put their country in the bulls eye of another superpower showdown reminiscent of the missile crisis
6798083 the military talk seems to be bluster on moscows part
6798084 cuba has nothing to gain from a military relationship which would be high risk and out of character with the steady renovation of diplomatic relationships
6798085 as ive heard dozens of times over the years from cubans on the island the bolos russians are not to be trusted

6798098 genuinely publicly devoted to a product or service even if they dont quite embody the values that the brands managers may be trying to convey
6798099 but it certainly could have a very subliminal effect it could degrade the brand
6798100 it only draws more attention to the association if they acknowledge it
6798101 that was a huge mistake an incredibly short sighted mistake
6798102 you do something like that youll have al sharpton on your doorstep
6798103 the fact that its an unpaid endorsement can be used as a selling point
6798104 the biggest cultural challenge facing english canadians is ultimately our failure to produce entertainment shows canadian shows that canadians actually want to watch we succeed when our content reaches and resonates with the broadest cross section of the greatest number of canadians
6798105 we concluded that we had too many specials and mini series its hard to build loyalty with them so now we are populating our prime time schedule with longer running series series keep people coming back to the network build loyalty and allow us to optimize our promotion
6798106 to determine what kind of programming appeals to different canadians and where we need to put that programming on our schedule to make sure that they are available to watch it when its on
6798107 has also informed our development process and we now do more program piloting and audience testing to refine concepts in short we try to get it right before we bring a program to air
6798108 ratings are an entirely inappropriate means of measuring the quality of programming or its usefulness to its audience
6798109 the simple fact that people watch or listen to something in no way demonstrates that it is what they want
6798110 advertisers bidding for audiences this is the economic dynamic that drives the commercial broadcasting industry
6798111 tf1s mission is to help coca cola for example sell its product now for a commercial message to be received the viewers brain must be available to it the mission of our programs is to make those brains available to amuse them to relax them between two commercials so as make them receptive what we are selling to coca cola is available human brain time
6798112 serious programs remind the audience that complex human problems are not solved by switching to a new deodorant
6798113 im not interested in culture im not interested in pro social values i have only one interest thats whether people watch the program thats my definition of good thats my definition of bad
6798114 we succeed when our content reaches and resonates with the broadest cross section of the greatest number of canadians
6798115 i dont know why people want to sort of say the cbc has some high art role i dont quite understand that the canada council is there to fund the high arts
6798116 bring into the greatest possible number of homes all that is best in every department of human knowledge endeavour and achievement
6798117 the whole idea of market democracy in media on which the criteria of ratings success rests is highly suspect if not utterly bogus
6798118 what is equated with what the audience wants through ratings discourse is nothing more than an indication of what actual audiences have come to accept in the various everyday situations in which they watch television it says nothing about the heterogeneous and contradictory interminglings of pleasures and frustrations that television audiencehood brings with it

6798143 although we have seen some improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6798144 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6798145 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6798146 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6798147 some particularly thorny issues are raised by the existence of financial institutions that may be perceived as too big to fail and the moral hazard issues that may arise when governments intervene in a financial crisis

6798217 im not sure that is the case at the moment perhaps as worrying as that statement is from the point of view of being the federal education minister i couldnt tell because the amount of information thats available doesnt enable me to make that judgment in a meaningful way
6798218 so i think the more information thats available to parents the better
6798219 people will still make choices for a wide variety of reasons
6798220 there should be very strong national standards and national assessments so we can say what it actually means to graduate from a high school rather than letting each state set its own benchmark
6798221 australian children are going to have to compete with kids all over the world so the opportunity to set really strong standards and make the information about them transparent to parents to educators to everybody seems to me to be a very intelligent central government function
6798222 put it this way if she ms gillard were to make everything transparent showing progress tying it to meaningful national assessments but without putting a letter grade on schools she would have accomplished a great deal
6798223 i think the power of letter grades is that they focus the mind but data and information will also focus the mind and you never want the best to be the enemy of the good
6798224 peer grouping methodologies are very important to enable genuine comparisons of like with like
6798225 we know that kids across the nation go to schools with a set of abilities and challenges and we know that schools that cater for disadvantaged communities tend to be working with more students who need extra assistance
6798226 whats got a negative reaction from many around the place is the sense that was pushed very strongly by the howard government that all of this was going to be about raw scores
6798227 school leaders and schoolteachers i think would respond well to feeling there is going to be an objective measurement and understanding of the nature of the particular task they face
6798228 were looking at a model about supplementing resources to make a difference for disadvantaged schools rather than a rewards based model
6798229 one would be in a better position to work out which schools need extraassistance a better position to then measure the difference that the extra assistance and implemented programs make that evaluation would enable us to identify and spread best practice
6798230 i will ensure that any matters arising from the inquiry will be duly acted upon and will engage with state and territory governments in their areas of responsibility
6798231 if she wants to come back we will embrace her but if it is her desire to stay whereshe now is we will only wish her well
6798232 the australian government needs to appoint some kind of investigation about all the children who came through this agency look at their background look into their documents
6798233 these children are going to want to find their parents the communication is being lost
6798234 the thing that got to me the most was that so much scrutiny was paid to the parents here in australia who wanted to adopt but very few checks seemed to have been done into the source of the children

6798241 the design of a scheme must recognise that compensation in one sector could transfer costs to another sector
6798242 the government has to make sure its analysis of economic impacts covers the economy as a whole and that includes the direct and indirect costs on small and medium businesses
6798243 there is no doubt that the only way to effect any change is to set an example we wont be able to move on to a focused and fruitful discussion of the policy details that can lead to effective change both at home and abroad until we acknowledge that the broad principles in the governments green paper are sound
6798244 if you ever have any slight discoloration please go to your dermatologist or your doctor and get it checked out as soon as possible
6798245 youll want to do it monthly less frequent ly and youll forget to do it
6798246 have a good mirror or a good friend or partner able to check your back
6798247 look for any skin blemish that is not normal for you
6798248 use your first three fingers and go in a circular motion from the nipple around it doesnt matter how you do it just be consistent
6798249 you can also do up and down and up and down then look in the mirror sometimes the nipple might retract or you could see dimpling theres one cancer inflammatory breast cancer that can show up like a rash check under armpits with the pads of your fingers for lymph checks
6798250 thats an uncomfortable thing to do those self exams youre just starting to know your body but a good place is the shower and probably monthly to make the habit pain is rarely a symptom its usually just a lump
6798251 unless we view screening in the context of prevention and diet and exercise then the screening opens a conversation when screening results are viewed in context of the big picture its more helpful
6798252 see a doctor for blood testing so youll get ideas about what to do with the results
6798253 i feel that my reputation has been impugned and that it continues to be damaged by the australian federal police referring to me on an ongoing basis as a suspect
6798254 this causes me a great deal of distress my career has been damaged by my inability to continue the specialist training program i had embarked upon this has had and will continue to have economic consequences for me and my family
6798255 i am also devoted to the creed of my profession as a doctor that my role is to do everything i can to save human life
6798256 i was first informed of my right to legal advice and assistance in the first interview the one conducted at the brisbane airport
6798257 while it is difficult to work out exactly what i would have done if i had been notified that i could myself make representations i think it likely that i would have sought to appear before the magistrate to make representations in relation to the afp officers request to extend my time in detention
6798258 when it occurred it was very brief and lacking in privacy
6798259 that made me realise what his intentions were in relation to my future with the company
6798260 very strange fiona is a very good singer with a wonderful voice
6798261 i am passionate about it i really care about its future and not just from a singers point of view
6798262 i think i have been overlooked but i can give dozens of singers names who have been overlooked
6798263 is not just for personal reasons its for the benefit of the entire operatic community that they hear australias finest voices and i truly believe they are not hearing them
6798264 id had meetings with fiona to discuss her possible roles with opera australia and at those meetings it was clear she would like to perform regularly with the company
6798265 but the letter that was sent to the board in april was a real bolt from the blue
6798266 to see a colleague and the company youre responsible for have such allegations levelled against them was very dispiriting
6798267 ive had a remarkable response not only from colleagues but from the public people ive never met in my life
6798268 i think it validates something i have felt for a long time and also that i have heard for a long time im not the only one who feels this way
6798269 i read what fiona said and i think shes picked up on what a lot of us feel
6798270 i felt the board gave us incredible respect they listened to everything i had to say they took note of it all and they promised they would get back to me

6798273 in this regard the recent decline in commodity prices as well as the increased stability of the dollar has been encouraging
6798274 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year

6798279 we can bicker for another century as to whether nugget coombs was right or sir paul hasluck really had the solutions to the health and wellbeing of indigenous people
6798280 but this futile battle of ideologies will not improve the life of one single aboriginal child will not lower the percentages of aboriginal people residing in our nations jails and quite frankly will not assist twiggy forrest find 50 000 jobs
6798281 a new platform of principles crafted for challenges beyond the traditional discourse based upon our mutual prejudices
6798282 for what it has acknowledged responsibility for the attempt to destroy us as a race of people by taking away our children
6798283 the nation will be enhanced by the constitutional recognition it accords indigenous peoples because governments need to be made accountable in their dealings with aboriginal peoples
6798284 they need to justly and constructively engage via negotiation on the alleviation of the disastrous health education and social ills bedevilling indigenous australians and embark courageously in dialogue on constitutional recognition beyond a preamble
6798285 both matters have to be dealt with and both should involve the free choices of the aboriginal peoples
6798286 anything less is simply a further contribution to the ongoing destruction of what is left of our uniqueness as indigenous people and our capacity to determine our own futures as equal citizens in an australian democracy

6798293 we are deeply concerned by this turn of events both because it is insulting to professor rosemary radford ruether and because of what it portends for academic freedom in a catholic institution
6798294 theres just a huge conflict going on between whether people can discuss controversial issues or whether you can only give the official position

6798305 donderdag hebben we een geweldige prestatie afgeleverd we staan in een olympische finale in een historische race en we staan in de uitslag
6798306 natuurlijk vloek je even ik zag het direct ik heb keihard op een tafel naast de baan geslagen maar we staan hier wel tussen de wereldtop bij deze discipline moet je goed wisselen anders is het voorbij
6798307 top tien was het doel maar ik kan hier mee leven
6798308 het waren twee slopende dagen meer zat er niet in
6798309 donderdag regende het dan weet je dat je altijd iets minder presteert een pr wordt dan moeilijk bovendien liet ik vrijdag de nodige punten liggen met de polsstok
6798310 ik heb nu in ieder geval laten zien dat ik er wel degelijk bij hoor
6798311 it is written in song of songs as a rose among thorns
6798312 so that there would appear 5 rigid leaves that surround a rose called the
6798313 and the creator said let there be light this light was created however it was concealed and enclosed within the covenant of the souls entered the rose and fructified it 3 just as the covenant is fructified in 42 zivugim unions of the creature and the creator from that seed so the secret name of the creator fills and inseminates all 42 letters of the initial act of creation i will now be publishing selections from the most important part of the book of zohar the introduction which is a concentrated version of the entire book of zohar this is how the introduction was conceived by the zohar s author rabbi shimon bar yochai rashbi the introduction is like keter which incorporates the entire idea of the book the chapters i will be publishing here will be abridged and i will add brief commentary in parentheses if you want to understand these chapters more in depth i suggest reading my book introduction to the book of zohar
6798314 he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and fire
6798315 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6798316 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6798317 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6798318 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6798319 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6798320 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6798321 anyone that barack obama wants is my choice for vice president but i do think that in the list of considerations there should be somebody from the house of representatives and chet edwards is a person that many of us think would be a good person to have in the mix
6798322 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6798323 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6798324 leaves too much scope for uncertainty for business to continue to invest in existing and new facilities
6798325 the rise of china and india is bringing the centre of gravity of world markets closer to our shores and with it a myriad of opportunities this means that three of the four biggest economies in the world now sit within our region
6798326 australia is finding itself closer to the centre of the world economy than either europe or north america will be at last our geographic position is an advantage not an obstacle
6798327 on mobile devices with gears installed the geolocation api can use the cell id of nearby cell towers or on board gps if either is available to improve the position fix in the near future well be adding data from your wi fi connection to improve accuracy even further on both desktop and mobile
6798328 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6798329 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6798330 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6798331 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6798332 fay has dumped more than two feet of rain along parts of floridas low lying central atlantic coast and was making its third pass through the state nearing cedar key on the states northwest coast with sustained winds weakening slightly to near 45 mph
6798333 state officials tallied storm casualties friday saying three people died in traffic accidents in the heavy rain and two others drowned in surf kicked up by the storm a sixth person died of carbon monoxide poisoning while testing generators just before the storm
6798334 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6798335 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6798336 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6798343 gone are the days when thieves needed to actually break into your house to carry off the hardware now you can do anything on the internet including ripping off the computers themselves
6798344 we think most of the computers are ending up in china russia and nigeria
6798345 but its hard to be certain their clever use of proxies means its difficult to know where the computers go but were pretty sure that once at their final destination theyre stripped down resprayed and sold on the black market as new computers
6798346 i thought something was wrong i looked around for the manual and when i turned back the computer was gone i switched off the modem but it was too late

6798356 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did

6798363 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling
6798364 celebrities like to spend the millions barack obama is no different only it is your money he wants to spend
6798365 that is it is not blue or red but somewhere in between
6798366 the state is pretty diverse from the very liberal boulder northwest of denver to the very conservative suburbs of denver and farming communities i think that since obama has done well in the rocky mountain region he has a real chance to win colorado even though the state is presently leaning to mccain
6798367 the growth of the hispanic voting population is part of the new democratic trend there but so is in migration from places like california
6798368 people just carry their partisan leanings with them to their new home college and hi tech communities also tend to be strongly democratic and those populations have increased in colorado too so there are several demographic shifts that have played a role
6798369 while occasionally mentioned as a possible target for john kerry in 2004 colorado has shifted to become one of the half dozen or so critical swing states for this year
6798370 the state has moved mostly because the demographics of the state are changing as are the attitudes of the people still living there
6798371 conservatives have been demoralised by high government spending and rising deficits during this bush presidency
6798372 i think he is going to win the election because of colorado i think it is going to be a swing state and it is going to be important at the end of the day
6798373 being a cowboy on a cattle drive was not a career move it was a tough dirty dangerous low paying job but it was the type of job that a black man could get in the 1870s
6798374 a lot of african americans in the old west were freed slaves who migrated west after the civil war back on southern plantations they worked with horses or were blacksmiths so it was only natural that they would gravitate towards these type of jobs in the west
6798375 if followed such advice could lead to life threatening consequences within 24 36 hours for some thousands of australians who depend on glucocorticoid replacement
6798376 its my feeling that this submission may have been suppressed or nobbled to avoid a few red faces in canberra and to preserve the impression that all is well with australian pharmaceutical product and consumer medicine information
6798377 for those who depend on adrenal replacement for their survival it is simply dangerous nonsense for the advice do not take cortate if you have an uncontrolled infection to remain on the books
6798378 external review did not support all the interpretations made in the correspondence
6798379 breached fundamental rules on the potential conflict of interest of reviewers
6798380 the rule of thumb thats applied is that for every one direct job you lose in the car plant theres another six or seven lost in services and indirect jobs in the auto components sector
6798381 in addition ford has announced they are having 18 more down days between now and november which essentially means they are cutting to a four day week
6798382 were worried that todays announcement may tip some companies over or put them right to the edge
6798383 thats why its important that kevin rudd doesnt sit around for too long on the recommendations contained in the bracks report
6798384 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6798385 its going to have a huge impact on those guys and their families
6798386 its crucial that tariffs be frozen imports have killed this industry here for us
6798387 moving forward if theres no tariffs at all were probably not going to be around here for very long
6798388 things that people wouldnt actually expect me to be involved in
6798389 if you want me to estimate how much time id say a couple of weeks before you see a major pullout

6798391 motorolas latest push to talk over cellular release demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and relevant applications that enable service providers to offer both enterprises and consumers a truly competitive communications experience
6798392 its cheaper to take the bus than to drive behind it
6798393 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
6798394 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
6798395 we need to ensure that there are robust contingency plans for managing in an orderly manner the default of a major participant
6798396 a critical question for regulators and supervisors is what their appropriate field of vision should be
6798397 under our current system supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation an alternative approach would broaden the mandate of regulators
6798398 the process is not always as nimble as we might like
6798399 for that reason less formal processes may sometimes be more effective and timely

6798406 it doesnt surprise me that men in those societies live longer than men in monogamous societies where they become widowed and have nobody to care for them
6798407 if you have got more wives to look after you they might fuss over you and that might help you live longer we know that in monogamous societies married men live longer than bachelors

6798605 die strecke ist sehr interessant und anders als ein typischer stra enkurs da es hier einige auslaufzonen gibt es macht viel spa hier zu fahren und technisch ist es herausfordernd auch wenn es etwas wie kanada hier aussieht so ist der kurs doch v llig anders die kurven sind schwierig und es dauert etwas bis man die richtige linie findet
6798606 wir begannen unter schlechten bedingungen es gab nur wenig grip weil die strecke sehr schmutzig war das hat sich im laufe des tages aber gebessert nun wird es interessant sein das zu analysieren was wir erreicht haben und was die anderen gemacht haben ich glaube wir sind f r morgen gut vorbereitet
6798607 die strecke ist recht sch n und sie haben das design schon beim ersten versuch ganz gut hinbekommen
6798608 das gripniveau wird im laufe des wochenendes noch besser werden heute war der grip auf der rennlinie gegen ende gut aber sobald man etwas neben der linie war wurde es schwierig das auto ist nicht schlecht aber ich habe am kurveneingang noch etwas mit einem nerv sen heck zu k mpfen und wir haben einige traktionsprobleme wir m ssen die balance f r morgen also noch verbessern
6798609 bis auf den beginn als die reifen schnell verschlissen waren weil es viel durchdrehende r der gab und das auto viel rutschte schienen die reifen ganz gut zu halten weil die streckenbedingungen nun auch stabiler sind

6798706 jesus brothers are mentioned in several bible verses matthew 12 46 luke 8 19 and mark 3 31 say that jesus mother and brothers came to see him the bible tells us that jesus had four brothers james joseph simon and judas matthew 13 55 the bible also tells us that jesus had sisters but they are not named or numbered matthew 13 56 in john 7 1 10 his brothers go on to the festival while jesus stays behind in acts 1 14 his brothers and mother are described as praying with the disciples later in galatians 1 19 it mentions that james was jesus brother the most natural conclusion of these passages is to interpret that jesus had actual blood siblings

6798834 the battle for polk county property appraiser has been a battle over appraisals during hard economic times in his campaign against incumbent marsha faux rusty boedicker has enumerated one property after another to demonstrate what he perceives as inequity in the countys property assessments boedicker a real estate agent in lakeland for six years estimated that 60 percent of properties countywide are overassessed while others are taxed at an unreasonably reduced rate
6798835 he cited a property on lake hollingsworth that sold for 1
6798836 faux said shes familiar with that property which was purchased by a couple who didnt negotiate the price
6798837 when that came through our office we called about it because it just didnt seem right she said
6798838 faux said the price was high for that area so her office set the assessed rate at the market level we have to do that for many properties she said
6798839 luxury condominiums in downtown tampa could be up for grabs soon for about 100 000 each but theres a catch youd have to buy all 171 units for at least 17 2 million the minimum bid thats a bargain considering units were originally marketed for about 200 000 to 1 million and the developer owes the bank more than 47 million
6798840 thats a good deal said jack mccabe owner of mccabe research amp consulting in south florida
6798841 fida sirdar who heads key developers told the tribune in march that he hoped the bankruptcy protection would enable the company to turn the development around in fact sirdar said at the time he had so much faith that the real estate market in tampa would improve that he was planning to start two more towers in 2009
6798842 sirda signed up buyers for two eight story condo towers in 2005 but by 2007 buyers were suing by the dozens to back out of deals
6798843 this probably wont be the last condo related auction projects such as the towers at channelside and trump tower tampa also are inching their way through bankruptcy court trump tower is little more than a lot on the hillsborough river but developers expressed fear last month that their multi million dollar property may be subject to a fire sale if they dont get a cash rich investor
6798844 condo officials say the westchase homeowners need not worry about property values if their concern is how this amenity will affect their community on a real estate level itll only help increase the traffic and interest for all neighboring communities said the eden project manager peter mead
6798845 neither mead nor norman knew how many condos had been sold as of tuesday but the buzz has been strong they said they say they have received inquiries from around the country and abroad about the units which range from 170 000 to 380 000

6798849 apartment rents have stabilized or dropped in florida nevada and arizona as landlords compete for tenants with desperate condo and homeowners including those leasing properties theyre unable to sell
6798850 in the naples fla area for example home prices fell 29 to 275 000 in july compared with a year earlier according to the naples area board of realtors rents are falling though not nearly as much in the naples metropolitan area rents fell 9 4 in the third quarter compared with a year earlier according to axiometrics
6798851 still the average monthly cost of renting an apartment in florida is 50 to 60 of what it costs to own according to jack mccabe of mccabe research amp consulting in deerfield beach fla
6798852 if home prices were going up and you could hold on to a house for a long time you might be able to make a case that its a better time to buy mccabe says
6798853 buying a home makes little sense especially if the buyer doesnt plan to use it frequently according to vincent valvo whose company puts out monthly home sales data on massachusetts rhode island and connecticut
6798854 q do you have any idea whats going on with that condo project called the carlyle behind mels diner in bonita it looks finished but its been empty for more than a year now
6798855 a the carlyle just looks empty deborah but its really the slow housing market the developer of the five story two building housing complex aptly named carlyle development llc finished construction in november but only 15 of the 60 units have been sold
6798856 the place looks abandoned because of the 15 sold units only six are occupied and only one is occupied on a year round basis however a few more of the sold units are ready to rent out so you should see some more activity at the complex in the coming months
6798857 realtor mickey gifford one of three real estate agents selling the property said the sale of the units has been extremely slow the last one closed in january
6798858 the real estate agents have opened up a furnished model to hopefully speed up the sales on the three bedroom 1 700 square foot units but it could be some time before the carlyle is bustling with activity all the units come with all appliances and are ready for residents expect for a couple homes that still need flooring but theres no rush as plenty of others are available
6798859 when no one responded to a call for bids thursday at the broward county courthouse a condemned lauderhill apartment complex reverted to the bank that has a 20 million investment in the place
6798860 the 26 building villas of lauderhill had plenty of company at the public auction nearly all the foreclosed homes and condominiums offered during the traditional courthouse steps fire sale failed to attract buyers
6798861 lackluster turnout at court foreclosure auctions is becoming common according to lawyers who frequent such auctions to bid for mortgage lenders last year there would be tons of bidders this year theres barely anyone said vincent dantonio a plantation based attorney who on thursday bid to keep three broward homes for a bank
6798862 many banks are retaining most of their foreclosed properties because there are so few good bid offers at the auctions said louis spagnuolo vp for wcs lending in boca raton also he said buyers have stopped attending them turning instead to banks in house real estate departments to buy property
6798863 its more efficient its a better deal for them and theyre buying in a non competitive arena spagnuolo said
6798864 its fair to say that some people are desperate said brad hunter a housing analyst in west palm beach
6798865 most people dumping properties this year bought during the peak of the housing boom in 2004 and 2005 many strapped homeowners are negotiating so called short sales
6798866 in broward county one in three home sales in miramar in the first six months of 2008 went for losses according to sun sentinel research which did not include foreclosure sales coconut creek parkland and weston also were among the hardest hit broward cities
6798867 in palm beach county during the same period west palm beach and palm beach gardens both had 34 percent of sellers taking less than they paid also hurting were the west central communities of royal palm beach and wellington where property values had soared during the housing boom
6798868 james diehl bought a three bedroom house in wellington for 389 000 in 2005 but quickly discovered south florida was too expensive the information technology analyst eventually found a higher paying job in atlanta so he and his wife rented their house here for about a year
6798869 knowing they couldnt sell the house for close to their mortgage amount and determined to avoid foreclosure the couple worked out a short sale with real estate agents who found a buyer for 284 000 27 percent less than the diehls had paid
6798870 mary cochrane bought a 290 000 townhouse in davie for her daughter in 2005 but she didnt read the fine print on her adjustable rate mortgage and saw her monthly payments rise a year later from about 1 600 to 2 400 she said the lender wouldnt modify the loan
6798871 she eventually contacted her neighbor a real estate agent who suggested she try a short sale
6798872 gerry thompson bought at the height of the housing boom and soon regretted it he paid 585 000 for a fort lauderdale home in 2005 for his daughter an investor but values started dropping the next year and the house needed major repairs fed up thompson sold it five months ago for 380 000 a 35 percent price cut
6798873 because he didnt qualify for a short sale he had to bring 83 000 at closing to make the deal work
6798874 i was quite happy with the sale price although it was considerably less than what we had in it said thompson who splits his time between northern florida and north carolina
6798875 hunter the west palm beach housing analyst said the mistakes that people have made in this real estate cycle will be remembered for decades
6798876 downtown tampa is so disgusting and so dirty living there would be like living in a sanitary land fill with nothing to do nothing to see and nowhere to go

6798878 thats a good deal said jack mccabe owner of mccabe research amp consulting in south florida this is just the beginning of the good deals to come the best deals will be had by people with lots of cash

6798955 as convention ceo and a pastor myself i am incredibly proud that so many esteemed leaders from the faith community will be with us to celebrate this historic occasion and honor the diverse faith traditions inside the democratic party
6798956 faith in 2009 how an obama administration will engage people of faith
6798957 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith
6798958 to solve some of new yorks most difficult energy and environmental problems in ways that improve the states economy
6798959 the introduction of a boil notice is deemed a necessary precautionary measure to ensure that public health is not put at risk
6798960 id always said id never write a book like this
6798961 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
6798962 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
6798963 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
6798964 and he and about four other people would read that
6798965 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
6798966 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
6798967 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
6798968 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
6798969 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
6798970 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
6798971 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
6798972 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
6798973 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
6798974 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
6798975 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here
6798976 when they called it was total bolt out of the blue
6798977 set out to become a nice suburban alcoholic and succeeded
6798978 like a b horror flick that was scheduled to run continuously for days
6798979 it helped me remember helped me look in on the wreckage of my past and i really havent had a thirsty day since i started working on it
6798980 you could have fecal material in that and if it had been irradiated it wouldnt harm you
6798981 i am opposed to consuming irradiated food because of the abundant and convincing evidence in the refereed scientific literature that the condensation products of the free radicals formed during irradiation produce statistically significant increases in carcinogenesis mutagenesis and cardiovascular disease in animals and man i will not address the reported destruction of vitamins and other nutrients by irradiation because suitable supplementation of the diet can prevent the development of such potential deficiencies however i cannot protect myself from the carcinogenic and other harmful insults to the body placed into the food supplies and i can see no tangible benefit to be traded for the possible increased incidence of malignant disease one to three decades in the future irradiation works by splitting chemical bonds in molecules with high energy beams to form ions and free radicals when sufficient critical bonds are split in organisms contaminating a food the organism is killed comparable bonds are split in the food ions are stable free radicals contain an unpaired electron and are inherently unstable and therefore reactive how long free radicals remain in food treated with a given dose of radiation or the reaction products formed in a given food cannot be calculated but must be tested experimentally for each food different doses of radiation will produce different amounts and kinds of products
6798982 we have solid evidence on the chemistry independent groups that have looked at the chemical data have stated categorically that these chemicals are carcinogenic
6798983 it simply never crossed his mind that anyone would have thought this was anything other than a toy
6798984 he had no intention of causing anybody any alarm he never thought he would be causing any alarm
6798985 he appreciates that perhaps in todays climate when people see a gun it can cause alarm he knows it was silly behaviour for a 25 year old man

6798987 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6798988 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6798989 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6798990 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions

6799032 typically the successful libraries are those that have been telling their stories for years they have developed strong programs and have worked hard to let their constituents know the value of library services then when the day comes that those services need protection there is an educated constituency that values the lirbrary and its services constituents who not only see libraries as an american value but who see their library as a community value
6799033 if you want people to know that your library has serious budgetary problems then all your communications efforts should emphasize how you are doing so much with so little
6799034 someone should tell him sannier about our students who when they find an e book in our collections ask if they can borrow a print copy of it from another library

6799040 est muy soberbio y que piensa que el poder pasa por este tipo de actitudes
6799041 la decisi n de desplazar a moreno es una gran injusticia y la verdad que nos tom a todos por sorpresa porque cuando fundamos la renovaci n lo hicimos para cambiar viejas metodolog as de autoritarismo y soberbia y donde la consigna era no m s los capangas de la pol tica
6799042 esta metodolog a a adi escobar es de capanga porque se lo expulsa y se deja sin trabajo a un hombre leal que milita hace doce a os con el ex gobernador carlos rovira y junto a mi y que sin ninguna explicaci n y sin ning n justificativo se lo desplaza de su cargo
6799043 por lo menos thomas hubiese tenido el decoro de llamarlo y decirle mira te dejo cesante por estos motivos cosa que hubiese sido mucho m s prolijo que por ah no haya causa justificada
6799044 es solo un hecho aislado de un hombre que est muy soberbio y que piensa que el poder pasa por este tipo de actitudes y que a lo mejor le hace feliz ser el malo de la pel cula
6799045 esto que est n viviendo las asociaciones civiles es malo porque estamos ante un gran injusticia y que seguramente dios sabr porque sucede esto y va a poner en su momento cada cosa en su lugar

6799062 weve been talking to the nypsc staff for awhile now about procedures in some specialized fios installations
6799063 we are working with the commission to ensure that they are comfortable with our grounding approach and that we understand what their expectations are
6799064 considering the aggressive rollout schedule included in the franchise and the railroading of the deal through the approval process one has to be concerned that verizon is sacrificing public safety for productivity
6799065 groups that have long opposed our nyc franchise are seizing the opportunity to file the document you found in their continuing attempts to stifle our fios offer
6799066 we are confident that our grounding procedures are in compliance with the code and that our employees our customers and our customers property are safe
6799067 the manhole covers themselves will weigh possibly as much as 40 to 50kg

6799069 ste es un show en el que todo puede pasar y so me entusiasma no voy a hacerme el t cnico voy a juzgar el show el esfuerzo y el crecimiento son importantes pero m s importante me parece el acting la actitud despu s de todo la gente quiere divertirse y en ese sentido con tanta participante desconocida creo que va a haber una competencia tremenda por llamar la atenci n
6799070 el primer concurso marc lo que podemos esperar hubo un nivel que sorprendi por eso para el segundo vamos a esperar mucho yo personalmente no voy a ser condescendiente con las ca das eso va a disminuir mucho el puntaje aunque tal vez puede estar compensando con la actitud correcta
6799071 adem s de la t cnica que es realmente complicada un ganador tiene que tener esp ritu de progreso ganas de superarse y la capacidad de armar un buen show tiene que derretir el hielo con su carisma y crecer de manera obvia que lo podamos ver por supuesto lo m s importante es que logre llegar a la gente

6799073 you almost have to get mentally prepared to come into the gym one of the reasons im here is i know there are so many more lives invested in this than just my own in terms of what our team is trying to do here
6799074 so given that responsibility given that im the leader of this team theres some accountability on my part to make sure im here and able to do my job i wouldnt be here if i wasnt ready to give them everything ive got and be in the right frame of mind to do that
6799075 im not going to run around like a headless chicken he said
6799076 we started with a thunderstorm then they countered with a hail storm but we won it with lightning bolts in the end
6799077 i hope not i hope they were sleeping because lord knows they were having a hard time doing that
6799078 im going to call wiz here in a minute we talked this morning we talk a couple of times a day three if need be we try to stay in as constant contact as we can because even though im here with volleyball were all in this together the family side of things weve got to stay on
6799079 as ive said she was as much a victim of this as anyone obviously not physically but to have to witness the things that shes had to see and to go through the loss that shes had to endure is not an easy thing
6799080 its a testament to her strength that shes working through it
6799081 absolutely a group decision our family made that decision collectively

6799084 the injury happened in the first game of pre season i was frustrated because the same thing happened to me last year

6799086 i rested for three days but for the last three weeks i have worked hard on my fitness levels again i was back in full training on monday with the team and everything is fine
6799087 in the end i was out for a month which was quite long but it wasnt a big problem because there were only three days when i couldnt train
6799088 after that i started to run a lot and work hard in the gym its better to have this sort of injury than the one i had last year because last year the problem was my eye and i couldnt do anything
6799089 i was just sitting at home watching tv this year although its not good when youre injured was better because i could work all the time
6799090 of course last week was frustrating and tough but i have started to train now and hopefully its all behind me
6799091 hopefully i can go through the whole season now and stay away from injuries

6799102 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure is not without complications this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
6799103 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement due in this case to a genetic disorder long term follow up is needed to assess the risks linked to the immunogenicity of allogenic composite tissues particularly as regards life expectancy following this initial success other patients are currently being assessed

6799113 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately we see those forces now having advanced on to the soil of georgia georgian territorial integrity is in question here
6799114 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6799115 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen

6799369 at first its a thunderstorm on our end and they came back with a hailstorm we beat them down with a few lightning bolts at the end
6799370 ive been dreaming about it since i was 4 years old
6799371 since my dad and i sat in our living room watching our old zenith that you had to push the buttons to change the channel we were watching the guys in 84 and 88 win gold medals thats why i chose volleyball over basketball thats why i brought my kid halfway around the world
6799372 i said at the beginning that winning or losing wasnt going to affect how i felt about myself as a player but it sure as hell is going to be nice to have a medal in the house
6799373 when he came in he decided we werent going to settle for just being middle of the road or settle for being maybe a contender
6799374 he got the guys in good training facilities he got the guys on good teams overseas he got a new philosophy as far as working hard working together no superstars picking each other up and everyone bought into it
6799375 russian middle blocker alexander volkov killed us all match and lloys looking at me the whole time like do something
6799376 we believe were a really good team and believe were right where we should be
6799377 our style is to keep the ball in play block and play defense
6799378 its not easy playing that kind of team because they are more physical than we are
6799379 we had to settle down because they came out in the third and fourth set and played great and served great
6799380 we kind of weathered the storm as we always say
6799381 at first its a thunderstorm on our end and they came back with a hailstorm we beat them down with a few lightning bolts at the end

6799387 im not so sure four years ago the team wouldnt have folded but under hughs guidance and with the maturation of some of our players its a different feeling

6799394 eh dengar ya isteri saya yang sah memang dua sekarang tetapi ada seorang lagi selingkuhan saya yang belum saya nikahi
6799395 yang penting bukti share itu harus berbentuk kwitansi atau bukti lainnya
6799396 bapak hakim dan pendengar sekalian kesalahan yang saya perbuat bisa jadi tidak dibenarkan dan tidak dapat dimaafkan tetapi saya punya alasan kenapa saya merampok uang rakyat dan menikah lebih dari satu isteri termasuk memiliki selingkuhan tetapi yang perlu bapak hakim tahu sampai sekarang saya masih tetap sebagai manusia saya belum mengambil surat malaikat kalau malaikat kan tidak makan minum tidak memiliki nafsu sementara saya manusia ada makan minum dan punya nafsu

6799425 i really enjoyed competing with the high horsepower cars in champ car last year and the superleague formula car should be every bit as fast but sounds a lot better the v12 is going to be great for the fans

6799427 we are delighted to welcome tristan to the fc porto family and all our supporters are eagerly awaiting the chance to see him aboard our car

6799445 its not like taking one drink puff shot etc will make you addicted
6799446 in 1979 a large passenger jet with 257 people on board left new zealand for a sightseeing flight to antarctica and back unknown to the pilots however someone had modified the flight coordinates by a mere two degrees this error placed the aircraft 28 miles 45 km to the east of where the pilots assumed they were as they approached antarctica the pilots descended to a lower altitude to give the passengers a better look at the landscape although both were experienced pilots neither had made this particular flight before and they had no way of knowing that the incorrect coordinates had placed them directly in the path of mount erebus an active volcano that rises from the frozen landscape to a height of more than 12 000 feet 3 700 m as the pilots flew onward the white of the snow and ice covering the volcano blended with the white of the clouds above making it appear as though they were flying over flat ground by the time the instruments sounded the warning that the ground was rising fast toward them it was too late the airplane crashed into the side of the volcano killing everyone on board it was a terrible tragedy brought on by a minor error a matter of only a few degrees
6799447 even small errors over time can make a dramatic difference in our lives let me share with you how i taught the same principle to young pilots suppose you were to take off from an airport at the equator intending to circumnavigate the globe but your course was off by just one degree by the time you returned to the same longitude how far off course would you be a few miles a hundred miles the answer might surprise you an error of only one degree would put you almost 500 miles 800 km off course or one hour of flight for a jet no one wants his life to end in tragedy but all too often like the pilots and passengers of the sightseeing flight we set out on what we hope will be an exciting journey only to realize too late that an error of a few degrees has set us on a course for spiritual disaster
6799448 can you promise me i wont become addicted can you promise me this wont hurt me if i try it just once

6799464 but theres not a concrete answer for that and thats why you need to understand methods
6799465 thats why we can be one of the few labs in the world that can focus on methods development
6799466 every time a person buys a product with an epa approved efficacy claim such as kills 99 percent of bacteria the public trusts the validity of the process used to prove that claim
6799467 our goal is to grow bacteria in a way thats relevant to how the bacteria exist where the product is used
6799468 that way we can have more confidence in the products actual effectiveness and so can the public
6799469 so many results depend on the process a person uses

6799517 during the week of the democratic national convention the chicago police were the targets of mounting provocation by both word and act
6799518 it took the form of obscene epithets and of rocks sticks bathroom tiles and even human feces hurled at police by demonstrators
6799519 its important to stress the fact that we didnt call ourselves re create chicago 68 or re create the democratic convention 68
6799520 we have no desire to re create what happened in chicago since that was as the walker report said a police riot
6799521 when we say re create 68 what were talking about is recreating the mass grassroots movements of the 1960s
6799522 we feel for the past 30 years at least weve been playing a rear guard action against a greatly powerful right thats been trying to roll back the gains of the 1960s so we wanted to re create those mass movements and start moving this country forward again in a more progressive direction
6799523 we dont want to let pro abortion politicians sweep the issue under the rug

6799528 people are sleeping in the street people dont know what to do we have a team that gets out there and pulls people up that have no income now with all the foreclosures and the bad economy i have more people coming to me all the time
6799529 these are desperate times and there are a lot of desperate people in the area

6799532 i met calvin and he took me to county social service to get the voucher to pay for rent
6799533 they gave me a real hard time and ended up turning me down for assistance then one of the guys with the county he basically told me that they wouldnt give me money because they saw calvin waiting for me in the parking lot they know about him they know what hes up to
6799534 i left muskegon basically because it was boring there was nothing to do there
6799535 my mother had alzheimers and i had to pay to take care of her i was looking for better work
6799536 ill usually work with the owner to provide a start up kit for the residents
6799537 i go around looking for homes for rent and i check the newspaper
6799538 someone can make double the rent or more if they put two or more beds in a room instead of trying to just have three people for a three bedroom house i have eight to 10 people in most of the homes
6799539 you know they said that after all the scandal and problems they had over there they just dont want to work together anymore
6799540 and im cool with that thats no problem i know they had some issues over there
6799541 i dont know i guess some of the neighbors think we will bring the property values down or something
6799542 they dont like having us here because we are homeless but we arent homeless anymore we have a home right here we are like a big happy family
6799543 im going back to the house and come back here and ill blow your head off
6799544 calvin is not working in the best interest of these people
6799545 i understand their concern but these are nice people living in the house they are behaved and keep the place immaculate i dont think the neighbors have such a clean house i dont want to make the neighbors unhappy i am trying my best to satisfy them but its not going to be tomorrow
6799546 we have received complaints from residents in serene country estates
6799547 weve spoken with code enforcement and neighborhood services and they have stated to us that the code in henderson is up to 10 unrelated people in a home we do realize it can be quite a shock when urban core issues the indigent and poverty stricken population creep into suburban areas people dont typically like that in their backyard and it does create friction we monitor it of course the best we can that was not the first time weve gotten a complaint from residents unhappy with transients renting near them and im sure it wont be the last
6799548 i tell them no drinking no drugs no late night partying
6799549 they need to be self sufficient and out looking for work
6799550 calvin used this house to lure people in because it is really nice
6799551 you know calvin got me connected to the people running this house which has been great but thats because the homeowners have been really good to us
6799552 but calvin tried to screw me first by trying to place her in a uninhabitable home and ive heard from plenty of other people that he has done shady things id rather be homeless than have someone like calvin helping me the thing is i didnt even know where to go for help until i was homeless because other homeless people told me what to do and where to go thats what calvin does he takes advantage of the fact that no one knows where to go for help
6799553 there are different owners and different tenants but i inspect every home and make the homeowner sign a contract saying they will maintain certain standards there isnt enough help for the homeless and im doing what i can to give them a leg up i show them how to get the rent vouchers i help them find a place to stay then they have a chance to get established and get a job we tell them no drugs or alcohol or violence and we kick them out if they dont follow the rules we are in a crisis right now with all these homeless people in las vegas somebody has to do what im doing
6799554 we are feeling the crunch and our staffing numbers stay the same the growth in indigents in need of assistance is outpacing us and our budget
6799555 we are a payer of last resort for people who have no other source of aid
6799556 if they are eligible for some other program like welfare we point them in that direction the financial assistance requires them to provide a rent receipt also there are requirements related to job training and the amount of job searches the goal is to help you get stabilized so you can pay rent and provide for yourself
6799557 ive been dealing with them for the past three years and they actually say calvin why dont you let these people find their own way to social services well i am the way a lot of the caseworkers dont like me but im not there to please them the caseworker is not doing the footwork just the deskwork im out there on the highways and byways looking to help people i do what they wont do
6799558 there is a shortage of space to put these individuals and las vegas has a major homeless problem
6799559 but with the chronic homeless giving them a place to stay for 30 60 90 days whatever nine times out of 10 that isnt going to work what does that really accomplish you are under this pressure at the end of 30 days you are supposed to have solved this issue or problem that maybe has been plaguing you for 20 years unless they are connecting them to other services and getting them the help they need its not benefiting anyone except for the homeowner and the person making a percentage

6799570 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
6799571 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
6799572 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
6799573 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future

6799592 we believe that neither throwing the jews into the sea nor putting the palestinian land on fire is logical and reasonable we have suggested that all native palestinians whether they are muslims christians or jews be allowed to take part in a general referendum before the eyes of the world and decide on a palestinian government any government that is the result of this referendum will be a legitimate government
6799593 unfortunately they dont all pay off the debt at the end of the month
6799594 a major pitfall is for the students that dont pay it off as we know if you dont pay it off the interest accrues and they get themselves into a huge problem its a small percentage the financially at risk students are the ones that have over 1 000 in debt on their credit card and its a small percentage but the ones that have it are in big trouble
6799595 the most major financial pitfall students can run into is putting too much on their credit card that they cant pay off at the end of the month
6799596 in general access is a problem because they can get credit anywhere
6799597 you just have to have a source of income credit card providers dont care if you have a job they know college students are going to have money they look upon them as being a good future customer they can be pretty lax with college students as far as the restrictions that are put on them they might not give students a high limit but then if you do pretty well with that theyll keep adding to it
6799598 all of our research has pointed to the parents as being the primary socialization agent meaning how they learn to be a consumer in the marketplace education comes from one of four sources parents peers schools or media where students get the most information about credit is from their parents

6799638 sometimes demands for ethnic autonomy or self determination can be met within an existing state
6799639 when communal violence escalates to ethnic cleansing moreover the return of large numbers of refugees to their place of origin after a cease fire has been reached is often impractical and even undesirable
6799640 partition may thus be the most humane lasting solution to such intense communal conflicts

6799647 the profession will not accept any increase in fees and we expect that if they are a regulatory body only then teachers should not have to pay any fee for that
6799648 this experience has led me to believe that one of the best ways to protect the financial system against future shocks including the possible failure of a major counterparty is by strengthening the financial infrastructure
6799649 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
6799650 we need to ensure that there are robust contingency plans for managing in an orderly manner the default of a major participant
6799651 a critical question for regulators and supervisors is what their appropriate field of vision should be
6799652 under our current system supervisors often focus on the financial conditions of individual institutions in isolation an alternative approach would broaden the mandate of regulators
6799653 the process is not always as nimble as we might like
6799654 for that reason less formal processes may sometimes be more effective and timely

6799759 the idea behind the second compilation package was to give our fans a chance to hear a lot of music they would otherwise not have a chance to enjoy
6799760 some of these songs got some radio play but many people didnt get to hear them so we thought it would be fun to give them a second shot we thought it would be cool to share all of this to keep ourselves out there while we start working on the next album for the past few weeks ive been listening to a lot of music and collecting ideas working at home in my garage in l a no matter how much success weve had theres always a lot of anxiety for me as the time comes to get to work on a new project i work a lot better when there are deadlines so if we dont get them from warner bros i create some arbitrary ones myself without that i have the tendency to write the same song over the course of two or three years and never finish its much better to create a point where you have to walk away
6799761 when were on the road i have to get up every morning and go to work
6799762 were working 12 15 hours a day on tour running on fumes half the time but its good to know youre getting paid at the end of the week i have a strong work ethic and its hard to adjust when were back home where were just messing around with songs it doesnt feel like im doing anything i really have to discipline myself to take care of what i need to in the morning and then get to work on songs in the afternoon i sit in my garage and formulate chunks of ideas then i take the melody lines ive been singing and put music behind it before getting together in the studio with mike and robby and taking it to the next level
6799763 we wanted to have a place where the clock wasnt constantly running and we could do things the way we wanted to do them
6799764 it seems like it took forever to get it up and running creatively but now everything works and were excited about doing our new project there still being a studio owner isnt something id recommend to anyone there are just a lot of details you have to get right before it can become a great creative sanctuary its cool to have the freedom to be there anytime we want though and it saves a lot of money not having to go to major commercial places anymore
6799765 i wasnt really feeling any kind of inspiration in los angeles i was sitting here just beating my head against the wall trying to write songs and i wasnt feeling inspired at all
6799766 i remember being up there playing and going sometimes god just cuts you a break
6799767 when we were coming up you could join a band play gigs for 20 people in places all over the country and get picked up by a major label
6799768 great songwriting when we start out we want to be someone else but its important to let ourselves grow beyond imitation and develop an original voice comprised of these other voices i listen to the radio these days and a lot of bands sound alike plus record companies are changing so fast and you dont know if theyll be around in five years but instead of being discouraged dig in deeper and get more out of yourself and your band believe in what you believe and believe in yourself and unless youre getting input from someone who has done more than you dont put too much stock in your critics the payoff is wonderful being able to be part of peoples lives in small ways finding out that our music has meant a lot to people and helped them through hard times its easy for rock stars to whine but seriously were lucky we have such an amazing job its got its problems and weird things to deal with but it sure beats getting up and going to work in a factory every day

6799781 i pulled the trigger he let me down he let you and your brother down he let us all down we had it all and he let it all crash to the ground that night after you two were asleep i told him so and he just sat there looking at me he was so pathetic and then he started telling me how he would get it all back and how everything was going to be all right he let me down i deserved better than that i took that double barreled shotgun out of under the bed you should have seen the look on his face and i shoved it under his chin and pulled both triggers
6799782 remember the day we buried him remember how it rained hell it was all i could do to not dance on his grave while they were shoveling the dirt on him
6799783 i killed him i can see it in your eyes you know i did it do you know that he actually wanted me to find a job like raising the two of you wasnt enough he wanted me to look for work like some kind of hired help ha im a woman of fine breeding my people and people like me run this country we dont work in shops or clean toilets i had everything i wanted and he took it away from me but i put him in his place and i put you in yours too
6799784 the other night when the doctor was here you were going to throttle the life out of me but the doctor stopped you
6799785 he whispered in my ear that if i killed you i would go to prison or worse that even though i had a good reason for it the courts would not be favorable to a man that killed a woman much less his own mother for any reason

6799792 only through the study and sharing of information gleaned from the metahuman community can the human race continue to advance and thrive in our quickly changing universe here at archetech it is our sole goal to keep the human race informed of metahuman developments and to provide all people with the tools to adapt to those developments it is unfortunate that many of those that fund our research wish to hide that information from those who could best benefit from it
6799793 we have spoken to the funding agency involved in this unfortunate situation
6799794 and have secured an agreement that will allow us to release the files in question to the public much of this information is of a technical nature as it involves metahuman scientific principles but we are confident that there is nothing in the report that is dangerous to national security

6799832 there was basically an agreement with the mayor that the issue wouldnt come up before reaching an agreement between the haredi members and me
6799833 the moment the mayor knew i wouldnt be at this meeting he put in the actual decision that in itself was something not right not fair and against all the agreements we made
6799834 the extreme haredim have in the past not shown tolerance for jewish life styles other than their own
6799835 people are concerned this will increase points of friction between the national religious camp and this particular extremist group
6799836 thats how i left thinking that it had been taken care of
6799837 but what actually happened in the meeting was completely different
6799838 he goes to the secular and tells them the haredim are taking over then he goes to the haredim and tells them look what the secular are doing he plays out every group against each other
6799839 everybody knows that the city agencies are in some way or another controlled by the mayors office if the mayor doesnt want the allocation he can probably arrange to have it not approved finally if he wants to he can push an agreement with the extremists but there are still more steps to be taken
6799840 its just the first stage and a lot of people still object i think that at the end of the day my original proposition will happen which is the radical haredim go to a different plot of land that makes sense for them the city the neighbors and everybody and i think in the end reason will win out it is just a shame that it was done in such a way
6799841 in the opinion of many voters he has not been actively building beit shemesh over the last ten years as a result the mayor needs the haredi vote to remain in power while most if not all extreme haredim dont even vote the mayor seems to believe that if he gives in to every haredi issue even if it means supporting the extreme haredim then the haredi community will support him in the next election

6799890 but it is an incompetence youre right its not a conspiracy
6799891 it should have been 100 per cent and is now
6799892 the bottom line is that we were in a business we should never have entered into in the first place
6799893 we then compounded the problem by not having the usual risk assessments
6799894 management action was too slow and follow up was poor
6799895 to sum it up i would say it was a failure to connect the dots
6799896 limited understanding of the existence or significant scale of the equity finance business before march 2005
6799897 one employees account had been out of order and accordingly subject to a margin call since october 2005 with 293 000 owing as at march 2008
6799898 the employee had been allowed to trade and increase the account even though it was subject to a margin call
6799899 they received a benefit from a customer with whom they had an ongoing business relationship and were in a position to treat that customer favourably whether or not they did so
6799900 of these five employees only one had disclosed the existence of their account to their line manager
6799901 there is now a clear line in the sand about behaviour within the bank
6799902 i sit across from him and i knew something was up he usually comes in and says hello i didnt know if he was pumped right up for the game or it was something i did at training
6799903 he didnt say anything he just got ready and away he went its hard to find those sort of blokes
6799904 i didnt tell them i didnt want to share my misery of all the players why did they ring and tell me about him why didnt they ring and tell me about someone else
6799905 i carried enough grief in thinking that he mightnt play without having to inform the players i was on the couch and needed treatment
6799906 i definitely wasnt going to anyone else hes just one of those blokes who puts himself in the right spot at the right time every time thats why hes the champion he is
6799907 when you see those doors open and you get that knock to go out on the field and hes in front of you you know youre in with a shot at the game hes just an incredible bloke to play with
6799908 that won us the game every conceivable thing that could have gone to a footy team went with them in the first half they had 23 sets to our 13 they had all the field position from about the first seven or eight minutes
6799909 i was elated with the boys at half time and i told them so they knew they had done a great job to keep it to 14 points i knew we could win it from there
6799910 after 8 1 2 months of mr wayne swan being the treasurer of australia it is considered to be a breakthrough or good news because one of the major four banks will pass on a full interest rate cut of 25 basis points if the reserve bank cuts the official cash rate
6799911 can anyone imagine that when the coalition was in government and the reserve bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points that anyone would even question whether the banks would pass it on
6799912 the only argument was how quickly would they pass it on
6799913 why is the reserve bank putting up rates why have there been 12 on the trot and eight rate rises in three years because inflation got out of control on the back of some pretty reckless spending by the previous government and on the back of their inattention to solving some of the problems in the economy particularly skills and particularly infrastructure

6799950 they were two enjoyable sessions with the lap times tumbling bit by bit as the drivers lapped and got confidence in the track layout the track surface is still very dirty and it is easy to make mistakes which can lose you precious tenths and to do a good lap time you have to be perfect i like the track theres a nice atmosphere and i have to say the organizers have done a good job today it was important that we find a good base set up immediately and we managed to do that
6799951 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known yesterday when i walked the track i thought it would be fun and today confirmed that impression there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past they have really done a good job today our weekend got off to a good start but obviously it is far too early to say where we are compared to the opposition overtaking it will be difficult as always i hope i dont need to by getting the best position in qualifying the set up we have found today is not bad but there is still plenty of room for improvement
