1950111 so virals an adjective that describes what happens its not a noun that you want to get you some of
1950112 this was possibly the greatest film i have ever seen it was superb on so many different levels the script the fighting the special effects all mould the perfect film within the first ten minutes i knew this film was going to keep me on the edge of my seat i have never been so excited by action scenes before and never laughed with so much shock at the extent of brutal fighting it is a genre of its own as it has none of that hollywood business where the bad guys always fail and the main character is invincible and although love is a factor it is not overplayed this film is electrifying to say the very least it has more fist action than all the rockys put together more blood than goodfellas and is as exciting if not more than a tarantino film
1950113 aku sih demokratis tak pernah memaksa adikku tuk meninggalkan rutinitas itu begitu pun pada orang tuaku

1950119 un fenomeno che si presenta puntuale ogni anno afferma il comandante giovanni canu ma che non di meno pu essere sottovalutato
1950120 in virt delle interazioni che possono sorgere tra unit da diporto in navigazione e bagnanti sottolinea il comandante della capitaneria di porto di viareggio capita che in questo periodo sulle pagine dei giornali siano pi frequenti le notizie relative ad eventi straordinari incagli e episodi che possono rovinare una bella vacanza ma questo non vuol dire che lattenzione della guardia costiera sia calata o rivolta altrove
1950121 nonostante la riduzione dellimboccatura di ingresso del porto dovuta allormai ben conosciuto fenomeno di insabbiamento che ha interessato la zona del fanale verde la rimanente zona dalla met circa del canale fino al fanale rosso appare idonea a consentire lingresso e luscita in sicurezza delle unit che devono comunque attenersi alle istruzioni date dalla capitaneria di porto di viareggio con gli avvisi ai naviganti tesi a garantire la sicura navigazione
1950122 la collisione di domenica scorsa ha affermato canu la conseguenza di un palese non rispetto delle regole di precedenza
1950123 i know that its just the law but it feels like such a slap in the face to me
1950124 its like after all ive been through this is just one more humiliation
1950125 i know it feels personal but its not its just the law its just business
1950126 the jugglers and the clowns they all did tricks for you
1950127 obviously the separation of church and state has resulted in the separation of ethics from state and it looks like common sense has been separated from government policy also
1950128 to have the government give convicted aliens a get out of jail free card with government funding and offer to pay people to kill themselves turns the concept of self help upside down and the idea of government funded healthcare plans advocating suicide over treatment is really twisted ethics its the care of the sick and the weak that makes humanity different than the animal kingdom in nature the sick and weak are left to die in civilized society we care for the sick and the weak we help and protect them we nurture and try to heal them if we exchange love for humankind for darwinian survival of the fittest were on a long walk off a short pier im afraid that the abyss of hell is where were headed
1950129 its about economics and not ethics god has no place in a discussion about taxes and money if convicted aliens self deport themselves then we dont have to mess with more legal costs to incarcerate them and if sick people will just kill themselves well save tons of money that wed otherwise pay to keep them alive
1950130 you cant sustain a country if you dont have sound fiscal policy and our nations fiscal policy sucks we cant just keep piling on costs and think well have any kind of civilization left hell we should just shoot the illegal aliens and the sick people the savings wed have to our health care system along with the reduced prison funding would stimulate the economy healthcare costs would drop like a rock and consumers would all benefit of course youd better stay legal and healthy or the state makes you dead but what the hey at least youre not getting your organs removed against your will like they do in china come to think about it if the state started doing that and selling them wed could probably use the money to offset tax increases or reduce the federal debt maybe the chinese are on to something
1950131 how could they not pay for medication that would help my life and yet offer to pay to end my life
1950132 people have always been free to kill themselves or leave the u s and travel abroad whether theyre here legally or not the government is only trying to inform and fund reasonable financial outcomes
1950133 to say that funding suicide or deportation is wrong is to miss the big picture the reality has nothing to do with money or ethics its about two things doing what you have to because someone makes you do it or doing what you want to because you can get away with it if we have to have government funded health care and cut the federal deficit then killing the unhealthy is the practical way to do that if we need illegal workers in our meat plants but we also want to deport the ones who havent got away with it and have been convicted its cheaper if they volunteer and we pay to fly them out they can always sneak back in anyway so its not a big deal these two government approaches are the most practical thing that officials have come up with in years now if wed just stop inspecting food altogether instead of wasting our time inspecting only 1 of all the food we import now which is a joke anyway wed save even more tax dollars i think someone like paris hilton being the president makes a lot of sense in todays world
1950134 and i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead

1950145 why pay for an envelope if you have nothing to hide
1950146 dont think too highly of yourself think with sober judgment each according to the measure of faith that god has assigned
1950147 therefore it ill becomes us to lift up ourselves and to despise others as if we only were the people in favor in heaven
1950148 god has no favorites he judges or rewards you according to what you do
1950149 because the work of the son brings glory to the father

1950179 you would not tell a child that is hurt or angry sit in the corner and meditate and all your pain will go away
1950180 bert thats scary so if all of this anger then wants to come out and we use one of these bypasses it sinks back into the body john before i did this work i had to constantly have rolaids in my pocket i always had indigestion heartburn headaches i couldnt sleep i was using drugs and alcohol addictively sometimes just to get to sleep since this great expulsion period in my life happened years ago i havent had a rolaids in my mouth and damn few headaches anger will wreak havoc on the body and soul and on your relationship to your children your wife and your friends and if you still have tremendous anger at your father in your body when youre around a father figure youll project that onto him its not fair to that person

1950187 they really enjoyed his messages about accountability hard work discipline and going the extra mile to help kids succeed he seemed genuinely interested in our efforts to reinvent public education using powerful online communication tools to reach students statewide
1950188 when you spend time with people it gives you a license to be a demanding coach or a demanding teacher
1950189 the only way to get through to students is to spend time with them
1950190 were all trying to take kids to a level they dont even know they want to get to
1950191 we will be seeing 3d effects in logo design that will reach different places and stimulate different viewers who are craving for a new fresh look

1950194 where are all the masses with regard to the alexandretta province which was occupied 80 years ago when the turkish syrian border was demarcated a few years ago any mention of the occupied alexandretta province was erased from the syrian curricula from elementary school to university
1950195 they have forgotten all about occupied al ahwaz the alexandretta province and about sabta and malila who is against normalization the resistance and hamas you say examine this shameful paradox several months ago hamas would launch decorative missiles and would accuse the palestinian authority of mahmoud abbas of oppressing resistance fighters now for the past two or three months hamas has given normalization a cute nickname tahdiya which sounds slightly nicer than normalization and it began to arrest people who launched missiles what is this paradox
1950196 a people that participates in a campaign on the scale of the arab zionist conflict and whose land is occupied cannot open a second front in alexandretta or anywhere else this does not mean that it has forgotten its rights but that it would be crazy to open several fronts simultaneously all over the world we learned this lesson painfully in 1967 when our army fought both in the south and in the north we must not live in delusions
1950197 my colleague dr ali oqla orsan said regarding the question of why we have forgotten alexandretta that it is all a question of priorities to be honest i do not understand these priorities alexandretta was occupied in 1936 and we have forgotten about it and al ahwaz was occupied in 1925 and we have forgotten about it palestine was occupied in 1948 so what are the priorities do you want to liberate the first region to fall or the last if you want to start with the last region go ahead and issue just one statement about the uae islands occupied by iran this proves that there is a defect in the thinking of the anti normalization committees
1950198 if someone could guarantee me a boy i would i just so want to give my husband a little boy to play football with

1950408 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
1950409 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election

1950545 la juve pu pensare quello che vuole io e lui abbiamo messo le cose in chiaro abbiamo parlato per noi e non abbiamo nessun dubbio si pu leggere di stankovic sui quotidiani tutti i giorni ma a noi non interessa stankovic mi piace mi piace il suo calcio la sua personalit e credo che dejan sia contento di lavorare con me molti pensano che il centrocampista centrale deve essere difensivo invece io credo che debba avere visione di gioco lancio tecnica e non solo fase difensiva se c cambiasso quella la sua posizione ma in quel ruolo pu giocare anche stankovic che inoltre utilizzabile anche in altre posizioni del centrocampo
1950546 preferisco dire che pi che un gioco da un punto di vista socio culturale il fenomeno pi importante del mondo di oggi nella nostra cultura latina molto pi che un gioco molto pi dei novanta minuti novanta minuti sono solo un periodo allinterno dei sette giorni della settimana nei quali si vive il calcio tutti i giorni il calcio per noi vita
1950547 sono daccordo ma preferisco dire che il calcio molto molto importante nella vita di tante persone capisco quello che vuole dire arrigo so bene che quando si parla di povert di guerra di bambini con tanti problemi o quando si parla di fenomeni sociali ed economici del nostro mondo allora il calcio sicuramente meno importante per il calcio importante nella vita di milioni e milioni di persone
1950548 non ho detto questo una storia montata dalla stampa inglese
1950549 laltro giorno ho conquistato la champions league come faccio a non avere le qualit per lavorare in inghilterra allora mi hanno chiesto se mi sentivo un tecnico speciale ho risposto di s perch avevo vinto tante cose e perch avevo appena vinto la coppa pi importante con una squadra come il porto dal giorno dopo ero lo special one non un problema ma io sono speciale solo a casa con mia moglie e i miei figli
1950550 c sempre una cosa in comune nei miei primi giorni nei quattro club per i quali ho lavorato
1950551 no ma prima di tutto voglio dire una cosa sulle biografie ce ne sono alcune non autorizzate e possono dire tante tante bugie non ci posso fare nulla devo vivere la mia vita di famiglia con passione e tranquillit la nostra casa chiusa a mia moglie non piace la luce che porta il mio lavoro siamo una famiglia molto felice poi il calcio il calcio e noi diventiamo persone molto famose nella societ ma in assoluto sono una persona normale
1950552 mia moglie molto importante dopo la laurea in filosofia non ha mai lavorato perch sono stato molto in giro per allenare porto lisbona barcellona londra e ora milano stato impossibile per lei avere una carriera una mamma fantastica e con il cuore che ha pensa sempre ad aiutare gli altri mi sembra anche pi fantastica perch le piace la tranquillit non ama la notoriet apprezza andare al supermercato in un negozio senza che la gente sappia che sposata con me questo mi piace veramente
1950553 me ne viene in mente uno che capitato allinizio della carriera quando allenavo una piccola squadra che ora gioca nella serie b portoghese il leria quando io ero l eravamo nel massimo campionato a fine stagione volevo un club migliore e dissi che non sarei rimasto per ho promesso che alcuni sarebbero venuti con me a gennaio eravamo terzi in classifica e mi chiama il porto a fine stagione cinque di quei giocatori vennero al porto insieme con me un anno dopo abbiamo vinto insieme la coppa uefa lanno successivo la champions league
1950554 si pu chiamare pressione alta ma si pu dire anche in un altro modo mi piace che la squadra faccia pressing alto nella met campo avversaria ma anche importante avere cultura tattica sufficiente per giocare in modo diverso in qualche partita abbiamo bisogno di passare un blocco e difendere dietro la linea del centrocampo in assoluto mi piace lidea di fare il pressing quando inizia la prima fase del possesso questo significa che i difensori devono giocare sulla linea del centrocampo e gli altri giocatori devono partire alti
1950555 no nella vita tutto diverso nella vita pressione bassissima senza nessun rischio famiglia tranquillit pace amore non prendo nessun rischio anche sotto il punto di vista degli investimenti economici sono un super difensivo un catenacciaro s s mi trovate nel giardino di casa mia tranquillo sono molto difensivo nella vita
1950556 sono un uomo di sport mi piace molto lo spirito dei giochi olimpici e di come sono nati anche se purtroppo ci sono stati alcuni problemi col doping e con altre cose anche se uno sport non mi piace tantissmo apprezzo tanto lo sforzo di un atleta di arrivare a conquistare una medaglia e portare sul podio la bandiera del proprio paese a quel punto non si pu pi parlare di non professionisti o amatori in tanti praticano sport individuali e lavorano con uno o due allenatori per tanto tempo per affrontare un solo avversario una cosa molto bella
1950557 quando arrivo in un club posso restarci dieci o ventanni ma anche un anno o un mese perch nel calcio tutto possibile ma se arrivi in una squadra come tecnico devi pensare di restarci cinquantanni non devo lavorare per il domani ma per il futuro del club luis scolari ad esempio arrivato al chelsea un mese fa e ha dichiarato di non aver mai visto un club cos organizzato con una struttura per gli allenamenti bellissima questo per me come vincere un titolo perch ho lavorato per realizzare quella struttura si deve lavorare per il club non in modo egoista e non per noi bisona fare sempre un progetto a lungo termine so che poi bisogna vincere e si deve cercare di portare gioie e coppe ma per essere con la coscienza a posto e far bene il mio lavoro da professionista devo lavorare con il club
1950558 ovviamente vogliamo vincere tutto io e il presidente moratti abbiamo una grande esperienza nel calcio sappiamo che giocheremo contro squadre forti e importanti in serie a ci sono tre quattro squadre di grande potenziale in champions league dieci dodici con le stesse nostre ambizioni non facile vincere io il presidente per la pensiamo allo stesso modo non vogliamo vincere solo oggi vogliamo un club vincente nel tempo e lavoriamo insieme in questa direzione mi sento sempre con marco branca e gabriele oriali abbiamo tutti grande esperienza e dobbiamo lavorare con tranquillit per il presente e il futuro
1950559 conservatore in politica s rivoluzionario nel calcio no sono semplicemente una persona con idee molto chiare una filosofia molto sobria di lavoro ho fiducia totale nel mio potenziale e nessuno mi far mai cambiare non ho intenzione di rivoluzionare come ha detto mister capello non ho nulla da insegnare in italia le dir di pi lui dice che non ho nulla da insegnare io dico che non voglio insegnare
1950560 prima di tutto perch non sono uno specialista sono solo informato e interessato a tutte le aree della societ la politica importante quando sento un politico parlare di calcio per me positivo perch il calcio diventa ancora pi importante nella societ ma come posso io parlare di politica come posso essere non conservatore se si deve fare tra virgolette rivoluzione politica uno deve saperne molto pi di me lo dico senza nessun problema per me lequilibrio nella vita importante
1950561 no non lho incontrato ma vero che il presidente che ha vinto di pi
1950562 non saprei ma questo non molto importante real madrid e milan sono due club con una grandissima storia e sicuramente il signor berlusconi molto orgoglioso della propria storia con il club del quale presidente
1950563 penso di s molto importante per il calcio italiano laltra settimana al trofeo tim ho parlato con alcune persone che conosco nel milan dicevamo che nessun giocatore importante ha lasciato litalia in questa stagione sono tutti rimasti e sono arrivati giocatori importanti come ronaldinho riise e muntari per noi molto molto importante il campionato potr diventare bello competitivo creare passione in tutto il mondo dobbiamo avere lambizione di fare qualcosa di bello come hanno fatto le squadre inglesi negli ultimi anni piazzando tre squadre nelle semifinali di champions league e due in finale il milan deve vincere assolutamente la uefa cup non una squadra per quella coppa e se la gioca deve conquistarla noi la juventus la roma e la fiorentina invece dopo la fase a gironi diventeremo nemici prima dobbiamo cercare di passare il turno tutte e quattro
1950564 dire adesso che siamo favoriti o che arriveremo ultimi per me non cambia assolutamente nulla
1950565 ndr sorride i moscerini che ci sono nel pomeriggio qui ad appiano molto difficile allenare con tutti i moscerini che ci sono in giro scherzi a parte sono cittadino del mondo e conosco il mondo ho giocato in italia una semifinale di uefa cup non vi ho mai giocato la champions league conosco bene litalia anche a livello sociale non ho avuto sorprese e nessun problema di adattamento
1950566 non sono daccordo non imporante let un uomo di ventanni pu pensare e giocare come un vecchio un uomo di quaranta pu essere mentalmente giovane e portare tanta esperienza un vero vincente non mai stanco di vincere la cosa importante per me che un calciatore si adatti alla mia filosofia di gioco un giocatore che possa arrivare perch adatto al ruolo che voglio che occupi questo quello che successo con muntari deve essere chiaro per tutti che lampard era la nostra prima opzione per sapevamo che la situazione era molto difficile anzi quasi impossibile muntari aspettava che si risolvesse la situazione quando abbiamo deciso che lo volevamo sapevamo gi che il ragazzo aveva il potenziale e le condizioni per fare bene con noi

1950781 police raided the headquarters of horkos corp a maker of machining tools and construction equipment and several other sites in the city of fukuyama about 370 miles southwest of tokyo said police spokesman ryoji manda the company is suspected of exporting equipment without obtaining government authorization he said in 2004 horkos exported several machining centers to south korea from where they could then have been sold to other countries japanese media reported the equipment is highly precise and can be used to make components for centrifuges that enrich uranium for use in nuclear bombs
1950782 in 2006 japanese police arrested the president and other employees of mitutoyo corp and the company later admitted it broke the law in a case involving the export of precision three dimensional measuring devices japanese news reports said the international atomic energy agency had earlier discovered mitutoyo made machinery at nuclear related sites in libya during inspections
1950783 four years after abdul qadeer khan the leader of the worlds largest black market in nuclear technology was put under house arrest and his operation declared shattered international inspectors and western officials are confronting a new mystery this time over who may have received blueprints for a sophisticated and compact nuclear weapon found on his networks computers working in secret for two years investigators have tracked the digitized blueprints to khan computers in switzerland dubai malaysia and thailand the blueprints are rapidly reproducible for creating a weapon that is relatively small and easy to hide making it potentially attractive to terrorists the revelation this weekend that the khan operation even had such a bomb blueprint underscores the questions that remain about what dr khan a pakistani metallurgist and the father of pakistans nuclear weapons program was selling and to whom it also raises the possibility that he may still have sensitive material
1950784 pakistani officials insist that dr khan as the leader of a uranium enrichment program had no weapons access but this is the second weapons design found in his smuggling network the first was for an unwieldy but effective chinese design from the mid 1960s that libya acknowledged obtaining from the khan network before it surrendered its bomb making equipment in 2003 both the new and the old designs exploit the principle of implosion in which a blast wave from a sphere of conventional explosives squeezes inward with tremendous force to compress a ball of bomb fuel starting the chain reaction and the atomic explosion a nuclear official in europe familiar with the khan investigation said the new design was powerful but miniaturized using about half the uranium fuel of the older design to produce a greater explosive force nuclear experts said a warhead built from the new design was small enough to fit atop a family of medium range missiles that derive from north koreas nodong class of missiles those missiles include pakistans ghauri and irans shahab all are about four feet wide and any warhead atop them must by definition be smaller
1950785 at least 40 developing countries from the persian gulf region to latin america have recently approached u n officials here to signal interest in starting nuclear power programs a trend that concerned proliferation experts say could provide the building blocks of nuclear arsenals in some of those nations at least half a dozen countries have also said in the past four years that they are specifically planning to conduct enrichment or reprocessing of nuclear fuel a prospect that could dramatically expand the global supply of plutonium and enriched uranium according to u s and international nuclear officials and arms control experts
1950786 for some middle eastern states with ready access to huge stocks of oil or natural gas such as kuwait saudi arabia and the united arab emirates the investment in nuclear power appears to be linked partly to concerns about a future regional arms race stoked in part by irans alleged interest in such an arsenal the officials said although the united arab emirates has a proven oil reserve of 100 billion barrels the worlds sixth largest in january it signed a deal with a french company to build two nuclear reactors wealthy neighbors kuwait and bahrain are also planning nuclear plants as are libya algeria and morocco in north africa and the kingdom of jordan even yemen one of the poorest countries in the arab world last year announced plans to purchase a nuclear reactor which it says is needed to produce electricity it is one of 11 middle eastern states now engaged in starting or expanding nuclear power programs meanwhile two of irans biggest rivals in the region turkey and egypt are moving forward with ambitious nuclear projects both countries abandoned any pursuit of nuclear power decades ago but are now on course to develop seven nuclear power plants four in egypt and three in turkey over the next decade
1950787 although u s intelligence agencies have concluded that iran halted its research into making nuclear weapons five years ago the islamic republic still seeks to make enriched uranium with centrifuges at its vast underground facility at natanz it is now operating about 3 000 centrifuges and plans to increase the number to 50 000
1950788 the second line of defense program at the department of energys national nuclear security administration nnsa seeks to interdict illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological material through airports seaports and border crossings in russia and other key transit states it strives to do this by helping states install and use radiation detection equipment at these sites and providing associated training and support since 2003 the second line of defense program has consisted of two components the core program that focuses on putting radiation detection in place at border crossings mid sized seaports and airports in russia other former soviet states eastern europe and other key countries and the megaports initiative that equips major international seaports shipping cargo to the united states with radiation detection equipment

1950790 john davis a chemist in bloomington ill knows about concrete for example he knows that if you keep concrete vibrating it wont set up before you can use it it will still pour like a liquid now he has applied that knowledge to a seemingly unrelated problem thousands of miles away he figured out that devices that keep concrete vibrating can be adapted to keep oil in alaskan storage tanks from freezing the oil spill recovery institute of cordova alaska paid him 20 000 for his idea the chemist and the institute came together through innocentive a company that links organizations seekers with problems challenges to people all over the world solvers who win cash prizes for resolving them the company gets a posting fee and if the problem is solved a finders fee equal to about 40 percent of the prize
1950791 the process according to john seely brown a theorist of information technology and former director of the xerox palo alto research center reflects a huge shift in popular culture from consuming to participating enabled by the interactivity so characteristic of the internet it is sometimes called open source science taking the name from open source software in which the source code or original programming is made public to encourage others to work on improving it the approach is catching on today would be innovators can sign up online to compete for prizes for feats as diverse as landing on the moon space xprize org lunar lander challenge www peta org feat in vitro contest asp this year researchers at the howard hughes medical institute and the university of washington began recruiting computer gamers to an online competition named foldit aimed at unraveling one of the knottiest problems of biology how proteins fold http fold it and in a report last year a panel appointed by the national research council recommended that the national science foundation the major government financing agency for physical science research offer prizes of 200 000 to 2 million in diverse areas as a first step in a major program to encourage more complex innovations addressing economic social and other challenges
1950792 senator john mccain of arizona the presumptive republican nominee for president has proposed that the government offer 300 million to whoever invents a battery compact enough powerful enough and cheap enough to replace fossil fuels
1950793 we can accumulate and make sense of all the knowledge that is relevant
1950794 innocentive began in 2000 as e lilly an in house innovation incubator at the pharmaceutical giant eli lilly mr spradlin said with the company posting problems that its employees had been unable to solve from the beginning the results were good he said most of our companies tell us they have a one third or better solve rate on their problems and that is more cost effective than anything they could have done internally the company says solvers come from 175 countries more than a third have doctorates mr spradlin said and while motivated by money they also have a desire to solve problems that matter the company with offices in waltham mass has a staff of scientists who work with seekers and solvers reviewing challenges to make sure they are clear and detailed and guiding would be solvers who may have a solution
1950795 specificity is crucial to innocentives operation people who have studied the company say
1950796 one critical element is encouraging organizations to take novel innovation approaches in the first place that was the task that drew the rockefeller foundation to the company said maria blair an associate vice president there ms blair said the foundation was nearing the end of an 18 month pilot program after which the success of the partnership would be assessed anecdotal evidence so far suggests the arrangement can be useful she said citing as an example a challenge to devise a reliable durable solar powered light source that could function as a flashlight and as general room illumination the solver ended up being a scientist from new zealand she said and his light is now being made in china
1950797 the nonprofits get a break on innocentive fees mr spradlin said and ms blair said the foundation could subsidize access to innovation platforms but she said many nonprofit organizations had difficulty dealing with intellectual property rights and related issues innocentive deals with these issues in part by requiring winning solvers to transfer intellectual property rights to the seekers whose identities are secret before they can claim an award
1950798 dr lakhani said some companies worried that by posting information about their problems they risk giving valuable information to competitors another fear he said is that a solver will devise a useful solution but refuse to turn it over for the prize or even patent it to keep it out of the hands of the organization that originally sought it
1950799 developing states want tariffs removed from agricultural products imported into developing nations while farmers in developing states fear that an influx of cheap agricultural products from abroad will ruin the market for domestic products
1950800 emotions always run high whenever domestic food production is discussed history is filled with tales of famine and death and that specter haunts the collective conscience of most nations the
1950801 to me the collapse of the doha round of trade talks demonstrates that the international system is not as resilient as it could or should be it also indicates the abject failure of leadership by developed nations in putting forth a vision and paradigm to lift the less developed nations into a position where they can be fully integrated nations sharing in the benefits of globalization
1950802 the failure of the talks after nine days of intense negotiations underscored what is likely to be the biggest challenge in coming years to expanding world trade the reluctance of emerging juggernauts such as india and china to risk their newfound success by offering rich nations greater access to the hundreds of millions of consumers rising out of poverty in the developing world high level delegations from the united states and the european union showed fresh willingness at the world trade organization talks to make concessions that would have gradually curbed the subsidies and tariffs they have long employed to protect first world farmers but india and china dug in their heels insisting on the right to keep protecting their farmers while accusing the united states and other rich countries of exaggerating the generosity of their concessions
1950803 the breakdown of these talks is bad news for the worlds businesses workers farmers and most importantly the poor said thomas j donohue president of the u s chamber of commerce its ironic that this blow came from two of the chief beneficiaries of worldwide trade india and china are emerging powers but with great power comes great responsibility they missed an opportunity to show leadership as key players in the global trading system the result is what most experts concede is at least a temporary mothballing of the doha round of trade talks so named because a group of nations agreed to work toward dramatic new cuts in subsidies and trade tariffs in qatars capital doha in 2001 the talks have floundered for the past seven years with negotiations falling apart each time trade ministers have gathered to try to hash out an accord
1950804 the failure appeared to end for the near term at least any hopes of a global deal to further open markets cut farm subsidies and strengthen the international trading system it is a massive blow to confidence in the global economy said peter power spokesman for the european commission the confidence shot in the arm that we needed badly will not now happen supporters of the so called doha round of talks which began in 2001 say a deal would have been a bulwark against protectionist sentiments that are likely to spread as economic growth falters in much of the world the failure also delivers a blow to the credibility of the world trade organization which sets and enforces the rules of international commerce it could set back efforts to work out other multilateral agreements including those intended to reduce the threat of global warming the collapse of the talks will not bring an end to world trade of course which will continue under current agreements many of which are between two or more countries rather than under the w t o but it is a big setback particularly to the hopes of smaller and poorer developing countries which were counting on gaining greater access to consumers in the united states europe and japan
1950805 some analysts said the spread of free trade for now is likely to shift toward more modest bilateral agreements or the expansion of regional trading blocs such as south americas mercosur and the association of southeast asian nations yet even bilateral deals have recently faced stronger resistance during a growing global wave of protectionism including in the united states where free trade agreements with colombia south korea and panama are being held up by opposition in congress we are heading toward the fragmentation of the global trading system into individual trading blocs regional and bilateral which offer no guarantee for the economic benefits we have seen in the post war era said randall soderquist senior trade program associate for the center for global development
1950806 economists and trade experts predicted that negotiators having come this close might not find the conditions for a broad deal among the 153 members of the trade organization for years if ever again deep skepticism about the advantages of free trade was on vivid display during the democratic primaries and it is growing in europe particularly as france italy and other countries have fallen into an american style economic malaise its important to move forward when the world is in a slowdown and is tempted to think of protectionism rather than opening up said norbert walter the chief economist at deutsche bank

1950809 u s aid to africa is becoming increasingly militarized resulting in skewed priorities and less attention to longer term development projects that could lead to greater stability across the continent according to a report released thursday by the advocacy group refugees international the report warns that the planned u s africa command designed to boost americas image and prevent terrorism is allowing the defense department to usurp funds traditionally directed by the state department and u s aid agencies
1950810 defense secretary robert m gates warned this week against the risk of a creeping militarization of u s foreign policy and said the state department should lead u s engagement with other countries the pentagon which controlled about 3 percent of official aid money a decade ago now controls 22 percent while the u s agency for international developments share has declined from 65 percent to 40 percent according to the 56 page report
1950811 mark malan author of the report for refugees international said the militarization has been driven by the u s focus on counterterrorism though the trend dates to the cold war era the more fundamental problem he said is a lack of consistent coherent u s foreign policy attention to africa for example the united states has dedicated nearly 50 million to hire contractors to train 2 000 soldiers in post civil war liberia a west african country of 4 million people meanwhile 5 5 million has been dedicated to boosting a weak and unprofessional army of 164 000 soldiers in congo a country of 65 million where a decade long conflict and humanitarian crisis have left an estimated 5 million people dead
1950812 the headquarters of the new african command post known as africom has not been determined and many african leaders have rejected hosting it a temporary headquarters is being set up in stuttgart germany and is expected to begin consolidating responsibility for the continent in october africom in part aims to better integrate u s efforts in africa by coordinating military activities with the state department and other agencies but the state department is being overwhelmed by the pentagon malan said that concern was also raised in a government accountability office report on africom released this week the report noted that africom which is to have about 1 300 employees has had difficulty integrating 13 staff members from the state department and other agencies state department and u s agency for international development officials have expressed concerns that africom will become the lead for all u s efforts in africa rather than just dod activities the report said
1950813 global food shortages have placed the middle east and north africa in a quandary as they are forced to choose between growing more crops to feed an expanding population or preserving their already scant supply of water for decades nations in this region have drained aquifers sucked the salt from seawater and diverted the mighty nile to make the deserts bloom but those projects were so costly and used so much water that it remained far more practical to import food than to produce it today some countries import 90 percent or more of their staples now the worldwide food crisis is making many countries in this politically volatile region rethink that math
1950814 the population of the region has more than quadrupled since 1950 to 364 million and is expected to reach nearly 600 million by 2050 by that time the amount of fresh water available for each person already scarce will be cut in half and declining resources could inflame political tensions further the countries of the region are caught between the hammer of rising food prices and the anvil of steadily declining water availability per capita alan r richards a professor of economics and environmental studies at the university of california santa cruz said via e mail there is no simple solution losing confidence in world markets these nations are turning anew to expensive schemes to maintain their food supply
1950815 djibouti is growing rice in solar powered greenhouses fed by groundwater and cooled with seawater in a project that produces what the world bank economist ruslan yemtsov calls probably the most expensive rice on earth several oil rich nations including saudi arabia have started searching for farmland in fertile but politically unstable countries like pakistan and sudan with the goal of growing crops to be shipped home in egypt where a shortage of subsidized bread led to rioting in april government officials say they are looking into growing wheat on two million acres straddling the border with sudan
1950816 economists and development experts say that nutritional self sufficiency in this part of the world presents challenges that are not easily overcome saudi arabia tapped aquifers to become self sufficient in wheat production in the 1980s by the early 1990s the kingdom had become a major exporter this year however the saudis said they would phase out the program because it used too much water egypt too has for decades dreamed of converting huge swaths of desert into lush farmland the most ambitious of these projects is in toshka a sahara desert oasis in a scorched lunar landscape of sand and rock outcroppings when the toshka farm was started in 1997 the egyptian president hosni mubarak compared its ambitions to building the pyramids involving roughly 500 000 acres of farmland and tens of thousands of residents but no one has moved there and only 30 000 acres or so have been planted the farms manager mohamed nagi mohamed says the sahara is perfect for farming as long as there is plenty of fertilizer and water for one thing the bugs cannot handle the summer heat so pesticides are not needed you can grow anything on this land he said showing off fields of alfalfa and rows of tomatoes and grapes shielded from the sun by gauzy white netting its a very nice project but it needs a lot of money mr mubarak calls his countrys growing population an urgent problem that has exacerbated the food crisis the population grows about 1 7 percent annually considerably slower than a generation ago but still fast enough that it is on pace to double by 2050 adding 1 3 million egyptians each year to the 77 million squeezed into an inhabited area roughly the size of taiwan is a daunting prospect for a country in which 20 percent of citizens already live in poverty
1950817 economists say that rather than seeking to become self sufficient with food countries in this region should grow crops for which they have a competitive advantage like produce or flowers which do not require much water and can be exported for top dollar
1950818 for example doron ovits a confident 39 year old with sunglasses pushed over his forehead and a deep tan runs a 150 acre tomato and pepper empire in the negev desert of israel his plants grown in greenhouses with elaborate trellises and then exported to europe are irrigated with treated sewer water that he says is so pure he has to add minerals back the water is pumped through drip irrigation lines covered tightly with black plastic to prevent evaporation a pumping station outside each greenhouse is equipped with a computer that tracks how much water and fertilizer is used mr ovits keeps tabs from his desktop computer with drip irrigation you save money its more precise he said you cant run it like a peasant a farmer you have to run it like a businessman israel is as obsessed with water as mr ovits is it was there in the 1950s that an engineer invented modern drip irrigation which saves water and fertilizer by feeding it drop by drop to a plants roots since then israel has become the worlds leader in maximizing agricultural output per drop of water and many believe that it serves as a viable model for other countries in the middle east and north africa
1950819 already tunisia has reinvigorated its agriculture sector by adopting some of the desert farming advances pioneered in israel and egypts new desert farms now grow mostly water sipping plants with drip irrigation the israeli government strictly regulates how much water farmers can use and requires many of them to irrigate with treated sewer water pumped to farms in purple pipes it has also begun using a desalination plant to cleanse brackish water for irrigation in the future another 200 million cubic meters of marginal water are to be recycled in addition to promoting the establishment of desalination plants shalom simhon israels agriculture minister wrote via e mail still four years of drought have created what mr simhon calls a deep water crisis forcing the country to cut farmers quotas

1950999 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
1951000 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
1951001 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
1951002 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
1951003 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
1951004 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
1951005 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
1951006 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
1951007 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
1951008 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

1951013 the retina is sort of on the back surface of your eyeball
1951014 so in our cameras we have a similar kind of eyeball thats made out of glass and our silicon photo detector sits on the surface of that hemispherical cavity in the same way that your rods and cones sit on the back surface of your eyeball
1951015 so they can kind of move relative to one another
1951016 and those little plastic ribbon cables can deform in a way that doesnt lead to fracture

1951030 jagalah lisanmu janganlah engkau mengghibah ngrasani saudaramu sendiri sesama muslim bukankah allah berfirman janganlah sebagian kamu menghibah menggunjing sebagian yang lain sukakah salah seorang diantara kamu memakan daging saudaranya yang sudah mati
1951031 ketahuilah bahwa ghibah dibolehkan untuk tujuan yang benar dan disyariatkan yang tidak mungkin tujuan itu tercapai kecuali dengan ghibah tersebut
1951032 bahwa ada seorang yang meminta ijin untuk menemui nabi r maka beliau mengatakan ijinkanlah dia dia adalah sejelek jeleknya kerabat
1951033 aku kira fulan dan fulan itu tidak mengetahui sesuatupun dari agama kita
1951034 aku pernah mendatangi nabi r lalu aku berkata sesungguhnya abu jahm dan muawiyah telah melamarku
1951035 adapun muawiyah dia itu miskin tidak punya harta dan adapun abu jahm maka dia itu tidak pernah menaruh tongkat dari pundaknya
1951036 ambillah apa yang mencukupimu dan anak anakmu dengan cara yang baik
1951037 imam nawawi v menyebutkan dalam bab ini hal hal yang dibolehkan ghibah didalamnya yaitu ada enam perkara ucapan beliau ini sangat baik sekali semuanya benar dan baik
1951038 senantiasa ahlus sunnah mencela ahlul ahwa bidah yang menyesatkan umat mereka melarang bermajlis dengan ahli bidah mengkhawatirkan fitnah mereka serta menjelaskan balasan mereka ahlussunnah tidak menganggap hal tersebut sebagai suatu ghibah
1951039 sebagian orang yang tidak paham akan agama ini mencela para ahli hadits dalam ucapan mereka tentang perawi perawi hadits sungguh kita telah mendapati banyak dari para imam dari kalangan tabiin membicarakan menggunjing mencela para perowi diantara mereka adalah hasan al bashri amp thowus mereka berdua mencela mabad al juhani said bin jubeir membicarakan tholq bin habib ibrahim dan amir membicarakan a l harits demikian pula yang diriwayatkan dari ayyub as sakhtiyani abdullah bin aun sulaiman at taimi syubah bin hajjaj sufyan ats tsauri malik bin anas al auzai abdullah bin mubarak yahya bin said al qoththon waki bin jarrah abdurrohman bin mahdi dan selain mereka dari para ahli ilmu mereka semua pernah membicarakan para perawi perawi dan mendhoifkannya tidaklah yang mendorong mereka dalam hal ini membicarakan menghibah para perawi melainkan untuk menasehati kaum muslimin tidak mungkin mereka hanya ingin mencela dan menghibah saja akan tetapi mereka ingin menjelaskan kelemahan para perawi tersebut agar diketahui kaum muslimin karena sebagian perawi yang lemah tersebut adalah ahli bidah sebagian lagi tertuduh memalsukan hadits dan sebagian lagi ada yang banyak kesalahannya maka para imam imam tersebut ingin menjelaskan hakekat mereka para perawi dengan sebenarnya dalam rangka menjaga agama ini dan menjelaskan hakekat sebenarnya karena persaksian dalam agama tentang hadits pent lebih utama untuk diteliti dari pada persaksian dalam masalah hak pribadi dan harta
1951040 disini imam tirmidzi ingin menjelaskan bahwa membicarakan mengunjing para perowi jarh wa tadil itu boleh hal ini telah disepakati oleh para salaf pendahulu umat ini dan para imam imam mereka demikian itu untuk membedakan mana perowi hadits yang bisa diterima dan mana yang tidak sebagian orang yang tidak memiliki ilmu mengira itu adalah ghibah yang diharamkan padahal tidak demikian sebab membicarakan aib seseorang jika ada maslahatnya meskipun pribadi dibolehkan dalam agama tanpa ada perselisihan lagi seperti mencela para saksi yang dusta maka kalau maslahatnya umum untuk muslimin ini lebih dibolehkan lagi
1951041 aku merasa berat jika mengatakan si fulan itu demikian dan demikian dari kesesatannya pent
1951042 jika engkau diam dan akupun juga diam maka kapan orang bodoh awam tahu mana yang benar dan mana yang salah
1951043 ada seseorang yang puasa sholat itikaf dan ada orang lain yang membantah ahli bidah manakah yang lebih anda sukai
1951044 tiga golongan manusia yang tidak ada larangan dalam mengghibah mereka salah satunya adalah ahli bidah yang extrim dalam bidahnya
1951045 tidak ada istilah ghibah dalam mencela pelaku bidah dan orang fasik yang menampakkan kefasikannya
1951046 pengekor hawa nafsu dalam agama ini tidak ada larangan dalam mengghibahnya
1951047 ketahuilah bahwa ghibah itu dibolehkan selama untuk tujuan yang disyariatkan yang tidak mungkin sampai kepadanya kecuali dengan ghibah tersebut maka tidak ada dosa didalamnya hal tersebut ada pada 6 keadaan

1951169 why should we hear about body bags and deaths oh i mean its not relevant so why should i waste my beautiful mind on something like that
1951170 it is unknowable how long that conflict will last it could be six days six weeks i doubt six months
1951171 it wont take weeks our military machine will crush iraq in a matter of days and theres no question that it will
1951172 now it isnt gong to be over in 24 hours but it isnt going to be months either
1951173 the idea that its going to be a long long long battle of some kind i think is belied by the fact of what happened in 1990 five days or five weeks or five months but it certainly isnt going to last any longer than that
1951174 i think it will go relatively quickly weeks rather than months

1951177 teacher moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies having a wife and he is childless his brother should marry the wife and raise up children to his brother
1951178 in the resurrection therefore which ones wife will she be for all seven had married her
1951179 the sons of this age marry and are given in marriage
1951180 but that the dead are raised even moses showed in the passage about the burning bush where he calls the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob

1951203 so i received my smile cards not to long ago and put them in my purse waiting for the perfect opportunity to pass them along as i was walking down a busy los angeles street i noticed a parking ticket official about to ticket a car whose meter had just ran out i asked the officer if he was about to ticket the car and he said yes so i went into my purse grabbed a quarter and put it in the meter i also grabbed a smile card and placed it on the windshield parking tickets in los angeles are a minimum of the official just laughed but also reminded me that it was illegal to place money in meters where the vehicle was not mine so check with state laws before possibly attempting this act either way it felt good to prevent someone from seeing that bright obnoxious orange piece of paper

1951219 part of the pleasure of this thrilling book is the plot trying to work out how all the threads will be connected and pace but another excellent aspect is how the author so well conveys the inner lives of her characters in particular in jack and flea she has created two people who are struggling to come to terms with the same kind of pain and who recognise and are in tune with each other from the start i desperately hope mo hayder will write another book about these two even though jack is thinking about moving to east england on his fruitless quest and flea has more than a few loose ends to deal with in particular the strange and so far unrevealed activities of her damaged brother mo hayder is as usual unafraid to write about horrible and horrific events in which political correctness does not figure she constructs a gruesomely involving imaginative story although she does not hold back from the gory details there is always a purpose in these revelations the result is a gripping book high on atmosphere convincing in its portrayal of major and minor characters and their emotions and totally involving to the reader

1951334 im very happy for the team its obviously been a difficult start to the year with some reliability issues but nonetheless to show the pace we did in this race was good and the calls we made on strategy were a credit to the team the pit stops were great
1951335 i am really happy about it i was leading my home grand prix unfortunately then we had a hydraulic problem and i had to stop the target for me was to finish but i know that not getting there was not down to me so i am really pleased with what i achieved

1951341 third in our devotion to militarism despite our limited resources we are failing to invest in our social infrastructure and other requirements for the long term health of the u s these are what economists call opportunity costs things not done because we spent our money on something else our public education system has deteriorated alarmingly we have failed to provide health care to all our citizens and neglected our responsibilities as the worlds number one polluter most important we have lost our competitiveness as a manufacturer for civilian needs an infinitely more efficient use of scarce resources than arms manufacturing

1951355 for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged
1951356 there have always been people willing to pay for the mac experience and ignore those who would tell them something else is just as good what youre seeing is an increase in the number of people who believe a mac is worth it some of us have felt that if more people would really try a mac theyd feel the same way and clearly its happening
1951357 os x is worth the 700 difference easy as near as i can tell unscientifically from talking to my pc using friends the 2 days month they spend dealing with windows bs compared to the two hours i spend each month dealing with os x bs yes theres some immediately pays for the difference within the first month if my time is worth 50 hour
1951358 macs other than the macpro are expensive for the hardware you get and arguably cheap for the software you get if you value the software and youre not out to buy the cheapest thing that will get you by then there is a value argument for macs on the other hand if you somehow need every possible gb of ram random access memory and hard drive and gpu graphics processing unit performance youll never beat a hand built windows or linux pc unless you factor in the cost of your time to select components do the assembly recover from the missteps etc
1951359 i think every pc company builds a quality product using quality components and often the same manufacturing partners
1951360 no one sets out to build a poor quality pc you build a product that supports the price point you target and provides the margins that your company needs to generate to be a successful enterprise apple hp dell no one builds a lower quality pc you cant sell defective memory or processors and hard drives are pretty much the same the difference is in the functionality which i think is a totally different concept than quality you can use more functional components that offer new features and have added costs which is mostly how we differentiate a 1 500 pc from a 500 one and not the build quality

1951363 for example 1password a mac password manager just came out with an update take a look at its long list fixes to get the idea for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged a changelog helps users know what has in fact been changed
1951364 why apple choses not to reveal whats in its changes is really lending more to its over secrecy issue people say the bush administration is secretive sheesh apple is beyond ridiculous maybe apple doesnt want to reveal security issues it fixes and thus just doesnt note them

1951426 today with oil prices above bin ladens stated goal his economic warfare strategy seems like a resounding success at a time al qaeda is on the run 144 oil is a major morale booster and the best birthday present for its 20th anniversary next month there is no need to elaborate on the implications of such a victory in terms of loss of u s prestige and our ability to prevail in the long war of the 21 century furthermore at current price level the u s will spend over 600 billion on imported oil this year more than our defense budget and much of that money will flow into the coffers of those who wish us ill it has long been clear that our oil dependence forces us to pay for both sides of the war on terrorism in light of this years figures we are paying the other side more than we invest in our own defense

1951436 in a lot of fields there can be significant scientific advances made using microfluidic devices and i think that has been hindered because it does take some degree of skill and equipment to make these devices

1951448 the companys idea is to track the gaze of window shoppers to determine which items in the window they are staring at then to display enlarged pictures a slide show or other information about those items on nearby computer screens philips says that the system could also be used in museums and art galleries to provide visitors with extra information as they need it

1951452 present global temperatures are in a warming phase that began 200 to 300 years ago some climate models suggest that human activities may have exacerbated this phase by raising the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases discussions of the potential effects of the weather include predictions that malaria will emerge from the tropics and become established in europe and north america the complex ecology and transmission dynamics of the disease as well as accounts of its early history refute such predictions until the second half of the 20th century malaria was endemic and widespread in many temperate regions with major epidemics as far north as the arctic circle from 1564 to the 1730s the coldest period of the little ice age malaria was an important cause of illness and death in several parts of england transmission began to decline only in the 19th century when the present warming trend was well under way the history of the disease in england underscores the role of factors other than temperature in malaria transmission
1951453 discussions of the potential impact of human induced global warming frequently include malaria a disease widely perceived as tropical articles in the popular and scientific press have predicted that warmer temperatures will result in malaria transmission in europe and north america 7 12 such predictions often based on simple computer models overlook malarias history until recently malaria was endemic and common in many temperate regions and major epidemics extended as far north as the arctic circle

1951683 my only purpose is that justice be done in this case i informed the court of the unethical conduct of justice roxas having me the case without telling me that it was also presented to the eighth division
1951684 so you mean the memorandum of the parties is an exercise in futility imagine the solicitor general submitting a memorandum of so many pages how many years have you been in the court of appeals
1951685 was that raised in the memorandum oh you did not read the memorandum
1951686 deadma i was part of the court of appeals for 8 years and i never heard of the word deadma
1951687 in your affidavit you said justice roxas flashed through your mind on several administrative cases pending against him is that based on your mind or on fact
1951688 your name has been mentioned by several justices as questionable because you have that habit of carrying folders and rollos of cases
1951689 i have never encountered anything like that in my nine years of stay in the court of appeals
1951690 in my nine years in the ca i have never encountered anything like that even without justice vidal dala dala ang records ng case he had the records of the case
1951691 i learned it even justice myrna dimaranan vidals staff tells me you are carrying a folder laging bago attach case mo dahil ang daming lamang folder your attach case is always new because there are lots of folders

1951701 capitalism has improved the lives of billions of people something thats easy to forget at a time of great economic uncertainty but it has left out billions more they have great needs but they cant express those needs in ways that matter to markets so they are stuck in poverty suffer from preventable diseases and never have a chance to make the most of their lives
1951702 one of our friends is in the middle of it right now and its been fun to see the whole process
1951703 new technological advances clearly are of little value in countries that have very few skilled workers who know how to use them

1951705 there was according to the 1970 2000 census data a significant increase in the number of years of schooling of the adult population

1951707 cumulative and residual effects of teachers on future student academic achievement
1951708 students benefiting from regular yearly assignment to more effective teachers have an extreme advantage in terms of attaining higher levels of achievement
1951709 at the primary level students that are placed with low performing teachers for several years in a row suffer an educational loss that is largely irreversible they stand very little chance of recovering the lost years
1951710 the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers
1951711 how the worlds best performing school systems come out on top
1951712 in singapore and south korea opinion polls show that the general public believes that teachers make a greater contribution to society than any other profession new teachers in all of the systems studied consistently reported that the status of the profession is one of the most important factors in their decision to become a teacher

1951717 we have during the past century bartered the true gospel for a substitute product which though it looks similiar enough in points of detail is as a whole a decidedly different thing
1951718 for the substitute product does not answer the ends for which the authentic gospel has in the past days proved itself so mighty
1951719 the new gospel conspicuously fails to produce deep reverence deep repentance deep humility a spirit of worship a concern for the church
1951720 we would suggest that the reason lies in its own character and content it fails to make men god centered in their thoughts and god fearing in their hearts because this is not primarily what it is trying to do
1951721 the church of god is the church only when she lives and thrives finally by gods truths and resources if the church makes anything else the decisive principle of her existence christians risk living unauthorized lives of faith exercising unauthorized ministries and proclaiming an unauthorized gospel

1952023 s nos afect al parecer en m xico todo lo relacionado con la m sica rock se ve relacionado con lo sat nico es una l stima que no se informe bien de cada caso pues por ejemplo nos adjudicaron ser drogadictos y degenerados sin siquiera conocernos
1952024 yo amo a kiss porque es la banda por la que todos nosotros empezamos a tocar y la que nos inclin a hacer este tipo de m sica estamos realmente muy muy excitados de compartir este tour con ellos porque es lo mejor que nos pod a haber pasado
1952025 es bastante m s extrema que la de kiss eso no cuenta porque lo que ellos tocan tambi n es duro en muchos sentidos
1952026 aunque hace un par de a os toqu con ellos es la primera vez que hacemos algo juntos no s lo me sorprendieron por ser un muy buen grupo sino porque es una banda que creci escuchando a kiss
1952027 cambiamos en muchos sentidos estamos en general en mejores condiciones individuales y grupales y el resultado es que sacamos un lbum muy fuerte en cuanto al contenido
1952028 cada grupo tiene que hacer lo que sienta por lo menos eso es lo que intentamos hacer nosotros pantera es una banda muy honesta
1952029 de todos modos avis vinnie como para no despistar a los amantes de la virulencia hay ciertos l mites nunca esperen un lbum pop de parte de pantera
1952030 sin ayuda de las radios la mtv o la industria
1952031 vamos a mostrarles las ltimas canciones pero la idea es hacer un show completo tocando temas de cada uno de nuestros cuatro lbumes
1952032 fue algo improvisado con amigos kisseros y sobre todo mucho sentimiento por la banda pudimos dar un show dign simo no s lo por nuestra performance sino tambi n por la respuesta de la gente
1952033 se cerraron las puertas para muchas bandas de rock fuerte la alternativa que encontr fue explorar lugares que se prestaran a recibir bandas nuevas y hacer shows ac sticos para que nos aceptaran hab a que armar una especie de demo que en realidad era una toma en vivo de un ensayo
1952034 mars attack surgi como una necesidad de zapar con amigos y el punto de uni n era kiss el demo fue pasando de mano en mano hasta llegar al sitio kiss related recordings que me pidi el material y a pesar de haber confesado que era un ensayo lo consideraron como un tributo a kiss
1952035 en principio es un derivado de mars attack cuando dejamos de presentarnos con los tributos a kiss empec a componer de nuevo por el momento grabo en casa gran parte del material nuevo y otras canciones almacenadas en estos a os

1952038 con bruce tuve m s contacto porque estuvimos tres veces con l ya sea con kefren o con mafia cuando vino para la kiss expo en mayo del 99 ensay en la misma sala con nosotros tocamos juntos y nos fuimos a bolichear despu s volv a estar con l en diciembre de ese mismo a o cuando vino con union y en mayo del a o pasado cuando toc con mafia tiene toda la onda es muy humilde un grande
1952039 de eric singer te puedo destacar dos cosas que me pasaron una cuando lleg al boliche lo primero que dijo al vernos fue
1952040 les informamos que por diferencias musicales leonardo moon ha dejado kefren el alejamiento ha sido en buenos t rminos por lo que la amistad cosechada entre ellos por tantos a os sigue intacta sebasti n gava daniel key ariel gambera y todo el staff le desea a leonardo lo mejor para su vida tanto en lo personal como en lo musical de com n acuerdo sebasti n y leonardo por respeto a los ltimos 14 a os de constante trabajo y en agradecimiento a los fans por el apoyo incondicional de siempre decidieron dejar a kefren en stand by por este motivo sebasti n daniel y ariel han decidido formar una nueva banda la cual se llama mafia el puesto de bajo ha sido ocupado por gustavo de filippo mafia est d ndole los toques finales a los temas que ser n parte del disco debut
1952041 con el tiempo nos fuimos llevando tan bien que me qued definitivamente alternando los shows con ambas bandas despu s de mi alejamiento de mafia me dediqu a pleno a fly
1952042 lo sacamos en forma independiente y logramos el sonido que quer amos bien grueso son doce temas y dos de ellos tienen su versi n en ingl s a modo de bonus tracks nuestro estilo tiene un poco de heavy metal pop hard rock y m sica electr nica el nombre de la banda no tiene un significado definido pero abarca las ganas que tenemos de volar lejos de los problemas la rutina con nuestra m sica intentaremos que la gente vuele con nosotros

1952080 it didnt bother me that rove referred to it as a political problem at the time because it meant that it would be properly dealt with finally
1952081 the political problem became a problem to me when they dropped the ball and allowed the program to continue it was politics that motivated them to investigate and it was politics that motivated them to allow the program to continue now the political nature bothers me

1952111 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1952112 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

1952177 bn has denied our rights thats why we support the opposition but even they dont move in the exact direction we want at the stroke of a pen pakatan led governments can give us fully aided tamil schools
1952178 right now its only one here and one there tell us what the plan is and how it will be executed if you can allocate 130 hectares for pig farms in selangor i am sure something can be done for tamil schools
1952179 we are not supporting pakatan rakyat to gain political positions but because they have promised a free society and we have faith in their promise
1952180 we recognise that any government needs to be pressured and lobbied to give the people what they want and this can only be effective when society and media is free and oppressive laws are abolished

1952182 tamil school headmasters have refused to meet with opposition figures and cited an education ministry order i personally had to leave a parent teacher association meeting in kulim before the headmaster would attend
1952183 samys attempt to mediate for the release of the hindraf 5 is a direct contradiction to what he said prior to the elections when he supported the arrests
1952184 as far as hindraf is concerned we have no faith in mics race based struggle and we dont take samy seriously we ourselves are an offshoot of police watch and we were formed to fill the void because no one was fighting for indians
1952185 we are not against the yang di pertuan agong or the country we are simply against the government that denies us our rights so with merdeka coming soon we want to launch our own campaign
1952186 this proves that despite being a minority community indians can still be kingmakers

1952194 additionally because there has been a quantifiable migration of experienced workers to the north we have added skilled employees at a faster rate than ever before i suspect the migration of the talent pool is based at least in part on people choosing a lifestyle associated with the area

1952250 they plot and allah plots and surely allah is the best of plotters
1952251 the harm the people of innovations disbelief or misguidance is greater that the harm of the enemies who wage war on the muslims for if those people conquer the muslim lands they do not corrupt the hearts of the people and the religion that lies within them except afterwards however those people the people of innovation corrupt the hearts from the very beginning
1952252 the innovators of islam and the fabricators of hadith are more harmful than the atheists because the atheists desire to corrupt the religion from the outside and these they desire to corrupt it from within they are like the people of a town who strive to corrupt it from within but the atheists are like those who have surrounded it from the outside so the ones who are inside open up the fortress so they are more evil to islaam than those who do not wear the cloak of islam
1952253 and sit not on every road threatening and hindering from the path of allah those who have iman in him and seeking to make it crooked
1952254 they were like the khawarijj making takfir of anyone who commits a sin
1952255 they want to extinguish the light of allah with their mouths but allah refuses except that his light should be perfected even though the kafirun hate it
1952256 i believe that we are in a global war against an ism that can be defeated and must be defeated
1952257 the report says that we must have a strategy that is political as much as it is military and that long term success demands the use of all elements of national power diplomacy intelligence covert action law enforcement economic policy foreign aid public policy and homeland defense president bush and the members of his administration could not agree more since the beginning of the war on terror the president has recognized that the war on terror is as much as conflict of visions as a conflict of arms
1952258 radical islam is an ideology and calling it the enemy implies that america is fighting a war not just of national interest but of ideas
1952259 we actually misnamed the war on terror it ought to be called the struggle against ideological extremists
1952260 the overwhelming obligation of our next president is clear make america stronger make america safer and win the death struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism just as american values brought down the berlin wall so will radical fundamentalism fall to the terrible swift power of our ideas as well as our swords
1952261 it is a war of ideas as much as it is a war of arms
1952262 the public is coming to understand that like our long struggle with communism the war on terrorism is a political struggle even more than it is a military war
1952263 its a battle of ideas as much as it is a military battle
1952264 bush has been unable to connect the dots between the terrorists and the rogue nations who grow them because he is reluctant to acknowledge that the war on terrorism is actually a war on radical islamic fundamentalism
1952265 the war on terror is as monumental a struggle as the cold war its outcome will determine whether we and our children live in freedom or in fear it is not as some people think a clash of civilizations radical islamic fundamentalism is not the true face of islam this is a clash between civilization and the enemies of civilization between humanitys best hopes and most primitive fears to destroy our enemy we have to know our enemy we have to understand that we are facing a radical fundamentalist movement with global reach and a very specific plan they are not just out to kill us for the sake of killing us they want to provoke a conflict that will radicalize the people of the muslim world turning them against the united states and the west and they hope to transform that anger into a force that will topple the regions governments and pave the way for a new empire an oppressive fundamentalist superstate stretching across a vast area from europe to africa from the middle east to central asia
1952266 war on terror as previously argued here is an ill conceived and vaporous term terrorism surely is not our enemy it cannot be an enemy because it is not an entity it is a method no we are fighting a very particular enemy militant islam it is a global network of identifiable militias as well as their state and non state sponsors who espouse and support an interpretation of islam that calls for violent jihad against the united states and our allies in the short term that enemy seeks to alter american policy in the long term it would supplant our constitutional order with a caliphate that accords with wahhabist principles that is the enemy
1952267 above all this is not a war against terrorists this definition of the enemy has been most unfortunate it has obscured us from seeing the face of an enemy that must be dealt with the war is caused planned and carried out by specific religious groups within islam they claim and probably justly according to their own lights to be implementing the demands of their religion they have a pious long range purpose to destroy the opponents of allah to make everyone else a believer generally speaking we are so indoctrinated with ecumenism or liberalism that we cannot comprehend how this thinking could be credible even though in the long history of islam its own expansion and consolidation were largely due to such successful military forces
1952268 the overwhelming obligation of our next president is clear make america stronger make america safer and win the death struggle between freedom and radical fundamentalism

1952357 i think that the fossils provide a few tantalizing clues that are consistent with an early presence of primitive anthropoid primates in asia
1952358 but i think that to have real confidence in the conclusions we need more material from the skeleton of this animal anthrasimias so from its cranium limbs and hands and feet
1952359 what we can say from the teeth is that these animals were also probably largely or significantly insectivorous

1952388 era una donna eccezionale si racconta che persino dannunzio si fosse innamorato di lei ma lei lo respinse pensa uno degli uomini piu potenti famosi e ricchi dellitalia quel tempo e non riusci mai a possederla
1952389 credo che lattrazione sia in fondo solo una reazione chimica dissi cercando di apparire intelligente a me e capitato di essere attratta da persone delle quali pensandoci adesso a mente fredda non riesco ad intravedere alcuna qualita degna di nota
1952390 anche io la penso cosi anche a me e accaduto ed accade tuttora

1952407 there are compelling advantages of not needing to carry a spare wheel and tools of knowing that you dont have to stop your car on a highway or a dangerous place to replace a flat out tire of increasing luggage space and reducing the overall weight of your car so our strategy is to improve the performance of run flat tyres and meet the needs of this projected demand

1952421 i think my music is really inspirational and i really made it for the people i really understood that in this internet age people are their own superstars the best bet that we had was to make a soundtrack to their own lives
1952422 with all the negativity that the press tries to put on me this perception that they try to create of me being a really bad person for so many fans to go out and say we still want to buy kanyes album means a lot to me

1952452 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
1952453 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
1952454 we will not leave our peacekeepers and russian citizens unprotected
1952455 heavy weapons and artillery have been sent there and tanks have been added deaths and injuries have been reported including among russian peacekeepers
1952456 its all very sad and alarming and of course there will be a response
1952457 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
1952458 all sides to end armed clashes and begin direct talks
1952459 the u s has been in discussions for many months with all parties to find a peaceful resolution
1952460 we urge all sides to refrain from violence and to begin direct talks
1952461 the objective of the operation is to protect the civilian population to ensure their security and then convince the separatists that there is not a military solution to this conflict
1952462 well have it working for the opening of the beijing olympic games the problem came when we converted the system from the test environment to the live environment in routing calls through from our network centres to the ibm research systems in california the network architecture was designed to put calls through the telephone system for as far as possible before going onto the internet to reduce latency

1952465 sexual escapades among cast members drug use and hardcore partying
1952466 peoples lives are way more sophisticated intricate and multifaceted than the systems they are using to manage them

1952468 seriously if youre looking to get rid of it ill take it off your hands
1952469 seriously dude you need to keep this car youre due to have a midlife crisis any day now
1952470 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
1952471 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
1952472 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
1952473 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years

1952478 she is a star and she has taught me a lot of lessons like humility which has been the driving force of my own accomplishments
1952479 is that mami manyi is uneducated and you are the one to keep the record of what you owe her we have learnt to be honest with her
1952480 mami manyi is a phenomenon she brings life to clerks quarters and if we dont see her for a day it seems life has come to a stand still
1952481 i have taught many that there is no small market all ventures are gifts from god i have taught them to shun jealousy and make friends with competitors
1952482 mami manyi is a blessing and a service to us all she is a force to reckon with it

1952489 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
1952490 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
1952491 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
1952492 we will always choose a lucky date for important events such as giving birth in the year of the pig or getting married or starting a new business venture on a prosperous date
1952493 if it werent for today we would have chosen valentines day to get married
1952494 chinese people always believe in the lucky number eight but there have also been many tragedies in 2008
1952495 i wish good luck to china for the remainder of 2008 because fate is something that we cannot escape
1952496 im just trying to control myself because if you dont you go crazy
1952497 if you dont look at it at 6 in the morning they will come get you by surprise
1952498 there is a big turnover and it is more difficult for us to provide individual and personal help
1952499 is legitimate defense since they migrants are locked up and innocent
1952500 self mutilation suicide attempts hunger strikes starting fires are frequent
1952501 pressure on foreigners and the increasing reduction in their rights generates a feeling of humiliation anxiety and revolt
1952502 you cant see a happy face here you are inside of nowhere
1952503 the japanese publics interest in this matter is extremely high and i explained that situation
1952504 i called for efforts from both sides for the swiftest solution possible and asked china to make further efforts president hu jintao said that he would make his utmost efforts for an early solution
1952505 we informed the japanese embassy about the food poisoning case in china in a swift manner without hiding it
1952506 we hope to achieve an early solution while boosting investigative cooperation
1952507 i also said that the japanese public is very interested in disclosure of information and underscored that point
1952508 the six way talks are facing a chance to move forward
1952509 i wont say we will be unhappy if you dont win a certain number of medals for the japanese people i am restraining myself from putting extra pressure on you
1952510 but to be honest it would be nice to win as many as possible

1952517 our main goal is to get the most detailed images and remote sensing data ever of the geologically active features on enceladus
1952518 from this data we may learn more about how eruptions tectonics and seismic activity alter the moons surface
1952519 wed like to refine our numbers and see which fracture or stripe is hotter than the rest because these results can offer evidence one way or the other for the existence of liquid water as the engine that powers the plumes
1952520 knowing the sizes of the particles their rates and what else is mixed in these jets can tell us a lot about whats happening inside the little moon
1952521 please understand that in spite of their best efforts over a long period of time they just could not find a harmonious way to work together

1952528 while the global renewable energy market is set to be worth us 750 billion a year by 2016 and the industry has an excellent track record in creating jobs in regional australia the governments failure to deliver a price for carbon and its continuing refusal to ratify the kyoto protocol means australian jobs and investment are heading overseas
1952529 i did not say that the writer did i just translated it
1952530 they do know something when they say one has to appreciate every little thing they have before 2007 elections i could wear any colors i liked although wearing hijab was still mandatory all shades of whites and blues and reds colorful headscarves but now id wonder if wearing navy blue is ok the stockings are see through what about that this manteau is baggy style with too many pockets would that be alright this one doesnt have any pockets what about this one the headscarf is a bit loose what should i do now can i still wear jeans there are still faint traces of my last nights make up on my face would they notice what about that bag that has a bright color can i wear cotton when i go shopping for a new manteau i feel drained both physically and mentally
1952531 oh fuck doesnt he understand i dont want to talk to anyone today
1952532 somehow garbage became viewed as a right rather than being conducted under a user fee system and that has had terrible consequences
1952533 for too long many people had discarded their rubbish without worrying about the consequences
1952534 industry must invest 36 billion a year in energy efficiency and 45 billion for research into new technologies while 51 billion a year is needed to make buildings more efficient and 88 billion to improve transport
1952535 the study shows us that a conscious effort to shift from traditional investment to more climate friendly alternatives will require governments to adopt new policies and change the way they use their funds
1952536 the required shift in future investment and financial flows needs a combination of actions by the intergovernmental process under the unfccc and national governments
1952537 solar photovoltaic grid and off grid windfarms biomass and micro and mini hydro plants were the most frequently mentioned renewable energy technology needs
1952538 since most of the investment occurs in oecd countries it is not surprising that oda funding for renewable energy is less than 4 of the total
1952539 private investment is and is likely to remain the main source of financing for renewable energy and energy efficiency consequently renewable energy has flourished in countries with supportive policies such as feed in tariffs developed financial markets and active private investors
1952540 this situation is changing particularly in the fast growing emerging markets of china india and brazil which are attracting increasing flows from foreign investors
1952541 worldwide fossil fuels are the most heavily subsidised energy sources these subsidies total an estimated 180 to 200 billion per year
1952542 support to the deployment of low carbon energy sources currently amounts to an estimated 33 billion each year 10 billion for renewables 16 billion for existing nuclear power plants and 6 billion for biofuels

1952576 1984 malt er ein d steres gem lde wenn es um die bestrebungen von npower geht
1952577 die macher dieser seite m glicherweise etwas anstreben was den von orwell beschriebenen zust nden erschreckend nahe kommt
1952578 es ist unbestritten eine gute idee mit den ressourcen unseres planeten m glichst schonend umzugehen und nicht unn tig energie zu verschwenden was man beim versuch die bestehenden verh ltnisse zu verbessern allerdings nicht vergessen darf ist dass der gute zweck nicht automatisch jedes mittel heiligt
1952579 es ist nun schon vier jahre her als der terror und seine folgen in israel noch hautnah in den zentren des landes zu sp ren waren fast t glich sah man sicherheitspersonal den bus nach verd chtigen gegenst nden absuchen manchmal wurden bei arabisch aussehenden passagieren sogar die p sse kontrolliert stra ensprerren und bombenfunde pr gten den alltag

1952582 die pharmaindustrie und die mit ihr verb ndete wissenschaft haben inzwischen an die 40 000 angeblich voneinander differrenzierbare menschliche krankheiten aufgelistet
1952583 wenn gesichert ist dass viele von ihnen keine eigentlichen krankheiten sind sondern individuell unterschiedliche folgen derselben fehlern hrung kann man das bel beseitigen und sie endlich von der liste streichen
1952584 innerhalb von 200 jahren und mehreren kriegen an denen deutschland keineswegs unbeteiligt gewesen ist wurden noch nie wehrpflichtige zur verteidigung eingesetzt bleibt die frage weshalb man trotzdem tausende junge menschen zwangsmustert und zu zwangsdiensten n tigt wo sie letztendlich doch gar nicht gebraucht werden

1952587 in wales we had and still have more than 1 000 grass roots activists pressuring shops and councils to stock fairtrade products
1952588 its also about the government getting involved and the welsh assembly has been very supportive so whichever country wanted to follow our lead would need a lot of support
1952589 once people see the fairtrade mark as a sign of quality rather than a brand itself then buying products that are approved will become second nature
1952590 for example the chocolate producers in ghana have the capacity to make every chocolate bar fairtrade certified if the demand is out there consumers have the power to make that happen
1952591 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
1952592 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200
1952593 often ill want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as i can so they stop and i can get some peace

1952595 the civil rights issues in fiji do not boil down to a hindu muslim type of conflict
1952596 the hindus and the muslims in fiji live in peace and live in harmony
1952597 the conflicts that we have as hindus in fiji relates more to the fact that ethnic indians primarily hindu have been discriminated against in the last 10 20 years or so as a result of the ethnic fijians and their actions if anything the muslim community has suffered with us
1952598 the islamic colonization of kashmir has been supported by islamic terrorists and fundamentalists who committed crimes of genocide against the community of kashmiri hindus in kashmir including targeted attacks on sikh community
1952599 unfortunately indian leaders have been romancing with the islamists anti hindus and anti indians
1952600 so much so that the self confessed killers and anti nationalists they have been wandering scot free in the streets of kashmir the government of india has established two standards of justice one for indians one for kashmiri muslims
1952601 the george w bush administration has been cozying up to the taliban regime in the same way as the earlier administration of president bill clinton
1952602 thousands of kashmiris hindus have been murdered hindus are suffering and the government is silent
1952603 sad and painful portrayal of the exclusivist and illogical mindset that rules the roost in kashmir
1952604 the governments approach towards this issue is reflective of its subjugation to the islamic diktats which cannot be accepted
1952605 from 1957 what was a trickle of removal of rights became under the rule of dr mahathir mohammed a torrent a waterfall
1952606 what was a trickle of temple demolitions about 25 years ago has now grown and till now 15 000 hindu temples have been demolished
1952607 they have taken away our economic rights they have deprived us in education
1952608 if this goes on for the next five to 10 years there will be no more hindus all will either have left or will have forcibly converted to islam
1952609 currently we are in the process of trying to have another constitution put in place which essentially would go back to the original constitution which would allow race neutral policies
1952610 we were put in a position where all of a sudden we were interlopers and we did not belong
1952611 the second thing they did was to make people homeless individuals who had lived on the same land for three generations were forced to leave their lands and tear down their homes and go away now where would they go
1952612 so we have squatter camps that have developed around fiji
1952613 in fiji if you are fiji indian and a fijian came and robbed your home nobody would come
1952614 nobody would come to assist you if you have no personal safety or security in your own home you start feeling very frightened
1952615 the exclusionary policy of the last 20 years of keeping out indians making them feel not wanted has eventually helped to destroy the economy of fiji
1952616 understandably a lot of fiji indians are not interested in coming back
1952617 its a situation where the government may end up having to rebuild the homes of the fiji indians and thats something that we are hopeful will end up happening

1952694 we verwelkomen dit amendement als een indicatie van grotere politieke welwillendheid om de ernstige en wijdverspreide mensenrechtenschendingen te adresseren die nog altijd begaan worden door het hele land verspreid
1952695 maar mooie woorden zijn niet genoeg ze moeten bekrachtigd worden met concrete actie
1952696 wil het amendement enig effect hebben dan moet het bekrachtigd worden met een fundamentele herziening en algemene controle van andere wetten inclusief de wetten voor criminele en strafrechtelijke procedures evenals andere juridische en gerechtelijke hervormingen
1952697 ratificatie van de mensenrechtenstandaarden is een belangrijke eerste stap maar het moet vergezeld worden door praktische maatregelen om hun bepalingen op landsniveau te implementeren

1952701 when i get a little money i buy books and if any is left i buy food and clothes
1952702 the classic is that theres always some new cure for cancer that comes out
1952703 and unfortunately people become disappointed when it doesnt come to fruition but part of that is because it was preliminary findings and then when there are more mature findings or when its analyzed a different way with a larger sample size it really didnt come out to those same findings
1952704 i was surprised that of the scientific communications that companies give out that about 60 per cent of them are based on findings from abstracts
1952705 so the majority of the findings of the press releases are related to preliminary findings that arent fully peer reviewed
1952706 about a fifth of those they didnt really say where they got their data they just said findings of a study it was a real sherlock holmes type of enterprise to try and track down where this study came from or was this original data was this abstract data or was it presented at a meeting
1952707 but really they didnt talk about the study limitations and the idea that this is preliminary studies or preliminary data almost universally this was not discussed
1952708 they often talk about adverse events or harms in this study similar to what they would do with commercials on tv where they list a variety of adverse events or side effects or harms
1952709 however we can clearly state that as the community that develops medicines and vaccines that improve and save lives our members are committed to accuracy and transparency in all public communications
1952710 recognizing the space limitations of a press release and the complexity of the research and development of new medicines and vaccines other sources are readily available and accessible to journalists seeking further information including websites and contacts
1952711 it may be that other companies differ from this in terms of quality
1952712 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
1952713 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing

1952737 but i dont see what good it would do to work in a job that i couldnt stand and if i have the choice not to why wouldnt i take that opportunity
1952738 when catherine stays at home i feel the house is more together because she has the time to do things like in depth cleaning and can be more attentive to the garden
1952739 she also has more time to find good deals at secondhand stores garage sales and at grocery stores

1952775 es geht uns nicht darum auf die aua zu schlagen sondern es liegt uns etwas daran der ffentlichkeit ins bewusstsein zu rufen dass die mobilit t eben folgen f r die umwelt hat
1952776 wenn man sich das unrichtige ergebnis ansieht kommt man zum schluss dass das fliegen ohnehin nicht so klimasch dlich ist das entspricht aber nicht den tatsachen
1952777 wenn man schon einen solchen emissionsrechner installiert sollte dieser der realit t entsprechen
1952778 es ist ein genereller trend dass sich fluggesellschaften dem problem der treibhausgasemissionen stellen

1952780 diese kritik betrifft allerdings nicht nur die aua die luftfahrtindustrie insgesamt betreibt immer noch massives lobbying um die wahren ausma e ihres beitrags zu den treibhausemissionen zu verschleiern

1952827 georgia has demonstrated its barbaric fascist essence we cannot remain on the sidelines and out of the effort to protect our brothers and citizens
1952828 we offer total amnesty to the separatists if they cease fire
1952829 we ask them to immediately cease fire not to test the georgian peoples patience and to stop the violence

1952872 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god

1952875 a good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit
1952876 every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire
1952877 not everyone who says to me lord lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he who does the will of my father in heaven
1952878 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name cast out demons in your name and done many wonders in your name
1952879 and then i will declare to them i never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness
1952880 therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine and does them i will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock 25

1952890 oh that a hand would come down from heaven and deliver me from my besetting sin
1952891 has been echoed throughout the centuries weve all wished for the same miracle can we really be delivered from the one step forward and two backward routine at times ive thought the answer to the question was no despite my sincere attempts at yielding myself to god i retained certain weaknesses sins is a more honest word that i concluded i would simply have to live with after all no one is perfect but i knew my private failure was no credit to christ who won the victory on the cross did he not promise that we could be free indeed through many failures and a few victories ive discovered that the most persistent sin can be dislodged we can be free from sins even the ones safely tucked away in the crevices of our souls
1952892 imagine a city that is constantly being attacked at a vulnerable point along one of its walls
1952893 god has a different plan for which he has given us a message of deliverance and hope true there are no easy miracles our success is neither instant nor automatic slick and easy solutions lead to false expectations which in turn spawn disappointment and unbelief applying biblical principles takes time and discipline but steady progress is possible even long established and sinful behavior patterns can be replaced by wholesome attitudes and actions

1952901 nee ik bied je ook mijn verontschuldigingen aan geloof me het voelt voor mij ook niet geweldig om op mijn vingers getikt te worden dit is een les die ik niet meer vergeet vanavond zal ik je het documentje laten zien
1952902 omdat ik ook gehoord wilde worden kijk dat ik het achter je rug om gedaan hebt is niet netjes maar die brief was er toch uitgegaan bovendien staat er niet zoveel nieuws in ik heb slechts mijn punt nog een keer bondig uit de doeken gedaan
1952903 denk voortaan effe na voordat je kinderen neemt en met wie

1952907 kun je niet naar de vestiging in heerhugowaard bellen en haar aan de telefoon vragen
1952908 dus ik ben voor niks gekomen heb ik daarvoor drie kwartier gefietst
1952909 ja hier heb ik het de afspraak staat voor morgen in het agenda

1952915 mevrouw het is niet nodig om zo gefrustreerd te doen stel nou dat u de uitverkoren kandidaat bent
1952916 dat brengt me gelijk bij punt twee toen ik hier naartoe fietste ben ik tot de conclusie gekomen dat ik dat niet dagelijks wil doen het is anderhalf uur fietsen per dag dat blijkt toch een afweging te zijn nu ik het gereden heb en het waait nu nog niet eens hard
1952917 nee ik ga niet nog een keer mijn werkschema omgooien je mag je collega overbrengen dat ik dit heel waardeloos vindt ik ben er klaar mee
1952918 als u de juiste kandidaat bent heeft u binnenkort wel een fulltime baan

1952922 the decline in sales we experienced in july continues to be driven by both tighter underwriting standards since the start of the year and the adverse psychological impact of news and information regarding increases in foreclosures and the subprime situation
1952923 although the median price posted an increase statewide there is a disparity between the lower priced or entry level markets where prices generally are soft at best and sales have declined sharply and some higher priced markets that continue to experience price appreciation along with somewhat smaller decreases in sales
1952924 with credit drying up in recent weeks we expect further weakness in sales over the next few months
1952925 it is too early to say how long the current credit crunch will continue but we are hopeful that we will avoid a prolonged credit crisis that might cause sales to decline over a longer period of time
1952926 it is important to note that decline in sales is not driven by weakening economic conditions
1952927 rather the statewide and national economies continue to move forward with no recession on the horizon at this point in time

1952990 i am just not sure it is the dignified thing to do to accommodate the riffraff
1952991 the riffraff as you call them need to be ministered to as much as any other social group

1953006 i beg you to consider your position this is neither the time or the place to deal with this woman and her depraved son in all probability they are both mad you are frightening people
1953007 almighty father who consigned the apostate tyrant your other son to the flames of hell hasten to our call for help and snatch from ruination and from the clutches of the midnight fiend this human being made in your image and likeness strike terror lord into the beast now laying waste to your vineyard let my mighty hand cast him out of your servant
1953008 we cast you out you onslaught of the infernal adversary
1953009 we command you begone and fly far from the precious blood of the divine lamb the bones of the martyrs command you give way to the holy apostolic church
1953010 may the trembling that afflicts this human frame the fear that afflicts this image of god descend on you make no resistance nor delay in departing from this young man use him no longer as your vessel do not think of despising my command because you know me to be a great sinner it is god himself who commands you god the father commands you god the holy spirit commands you the blood of the martyrs commands you the continence of the confessors command you depart then transgressor depart seducer full of lies and cunning foe of virtue persecutor of the innocent i now and this moment adjure you profligate dragon in the name of the spotless lamb who has trodden down the asp and the basilisk and overcome the lion and the dragon to depart from this boy depart from the church of god
1953011 tremble and flee as we call on the name of the lord before whom the denizens of hell cower to whom the heavenly virtues powers and dominations are subject whom the cherubim and seraphim praise with unending cries as they sing holy holy holy lord god of sabaoth
1953012 it is hard for you to kick against the goad the longer you delay the heavier your punishment shall be for it is not men you are condemning but rather him who rules the living and the dead who is coming to judge both the living and the dead and the world by fire give place to the holy spirit who by his blessed apostle peter openly struck you down in the person of simon magus who cursed your lies in annas and saphira who smote you in king herod because he had not given honour to god who by his apostle paul afflicted you with the night of blindness in the magician elyma and by the mouth of the same apostle bade you to go out of pythonissa the soothsayer

1953017 i have no hard feeling for cam after all he did give me a chance
1953018 but i will say this i was loyal to him and he took advantage
1953019 what no i practiced i just feel nervous when youre staring so closely at me
1953020 im a beginner miss tong mark my exams with sympathy
1953021 wah you girls so poor thing got no one at home to accompany you thats why stay in school is it
1953022 an israeli policeman and a palestinian on the temple mount
1953023 regarding your picture on page a5 sept 30 of the israeli soldier and the palestinian on the temple mount that palestinian is actually my son tuvia grossman a jewish student from chicago he and two of his friends were pulled from their taxicab while traveling in jerusalem by a mob of palestinian arabs and were severely beaten and stabbed that picture could not have been taken on the temple mount because there are no gas stations on the temple mount and certainly none with hebrew lettering like the one clearly seen behind the israeli soldier attempting to protect my son from the mob
1953024 i was in a taxi on the way to the kotel western wall and we got stoned they took me out of the car and beat me and i gave a scream and for a second they let go of me and i said shma yisrael because i thought it was all over after they let go of me i ran even though i had a knife in my leg g d gave me the strength to run and i was able to make it up the hill where there were soldiers by the gas station and they took care of me but i was being beaten for around 5 or 6 minutes with a rock on the top of my head and i was stabbed in the back of my leg and kicked and punched all over my body
1953025 when i saw the mis captioned ap picture i was extremely extremely upset people see a picture of a youth and they think that its a palestinian being beaten by israelis it changes their world view and makes them think that its the israelis beating up the arabs i was extremely upset it was totally the opposite that policeman was yelling at the arabs to back off and was protecting me from them so to change it around and to say that he was beating me thats just total distortion and the world must be notified about how this is not true the jews are the ones suffering at the hands of the arabs
1953026 happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
1953027 in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1953028 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus
1953029 upon reflection it was a tasteless remark that i now bitterly regret
1953030 i am grateful to you for the opportunity to address those present and hope that the continuing work of the organisation will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity

1953045 a baby is put in a play pen to keep it from getting at the matches or falling downstairs and though the intention of the pen is to keep the baby closed in parents are naturally proud when the child grows strong enough to climb out likewise a man can perform actions which are truly moral only when he is no longer motivated by the fear of hell that is when he grows into union with the good that is beyond good and evil which in other words does not act from the love of rewards or the fear of punishment
1953046 in all of our studies history is best qualified to reward our research
1953047 all of that happened a long time ago you got move on
1953048 the form has changed but the essence remains the same
1953049 people have realized that the complete removal of the feminine element from the christian message is a shortcoming from an anthropological viewpoint it is theologically and anthropologically important for woman to be at the center of christianity
1953050 that there may be an increase in the number of those who as volunteers offer their services to the christian community with generous and prompt availability

1953054 the ability to choose and the freedom to choose between competing conceptions of how to live it is only the exercise of autonomy that our lives become any real sense our own the ending of our lives determines lifes final shape and meaning both for ourselves and in the eyes of others when we are denied control at the end of our lives we are denied autonomy

1953071 thieves came to my house at midnight woke me up from sleep and collected all the money i had in the house after that they took me to my shop and collected what i had in my coffers
1953072 according to our recent records we have registered mostly aggravated theft but we are already getting rid of it
1953073 by failing to correct their children when they are young some parents help in bringing up bandits who are now disturbing the peace of our town
1953074 people come to the police to bail their relatives or friends and promise to bring them back whenever we need them but along the line when the bail is granted the accused is nowhere to be found and this is how the accused would continue with what he was doing these are cases which make our job very difficult at one point in time we decided not to grant bail till the suspect is judged so that he can be corrected
1953075 die studie hat zumindest vom ansatz her recht die filmindustrie hat derzeit mit wirtschaftlich schlechten zeiten zu k mpfen
1953076 seit vergangener woche sind die entsprechenden werte f r besucherzahlen und ums tze in deutschland aber wieder ins minus gerutscht
1953077 vor allem das kinogesch ft ist aber ein l ngerfristiges eine generelle wirtschaftliche tendenz l sst sich deshalb pauschal nur sehr schwer feststellen
1953078 seit einigen jahren hat sich das grundlegend ge ndert mein eindruck ist dass die filmwirtschaft heute wesentlich st rker von wirtschaftsflauten betroffen ist als fr her
1953079 der siegeszug des internets und das damit einhergehende problem der piraterie stellen ein zunehmendes problem f r die filmindustrie dar
1953080 in deutschland k mpft die filmwirtschaft traditionell mit einem umsatzr ckgang w hrend der sommerzeit in den usa f llt dieses sommerloch weg und viele blockbuster produktionen kommen in diesem zeitraum in die kinos
1953081 eine gro e zukunftshoffnung der kino branche ist das digitale 3d kino durch das dreidimensionale seherlebnis k nnten sich die kinos von anderen entertainmentangeboten absetzen und somit die eigene wirtschaftliche position st rken
1953082 dies kommt vor allem daher dass es im osten schlicht weniger ausbildungspl tze gibt
1953083 doch es ist nicht nur das angebot an ausbildungspl tzen das diese bewegung ausl st sondern auch die einwohnerdichte
1953084 vor allem entlang der innerdeutschen grenzen also in sachsen anhalt und th ringen ist die quote der jugendlichen die sich aus ihren heimatregionen verabschieden sehr hoch
1953085 dies liegt zum einen daran dass die strukturellen gegebenheiten dort besser sind und zum anderen an der randlage sachsens
1953086 man muss jedoch abwarten wie sich dieses ph nomen in den n chsten jahren entwickeln wird
1953087 der geburtenknick von anfang der 1990er jahre macht sich jetzt bemerkbar und entlastet die an sich angespannte situation
1953088 wir haben uns rein an meldestatistiken orientiert und keine gezielten befragungen gemacht
1953089 wir wollen einen biochip entwickeln der blut auf tumormarker testet die charakteristisch sind f r darmkrebs

1953092 the new clearwire transaction presents an unparalleled opportunity to accelerate broadband deployment in the united states
1953093 their claims lack merit and provide no basis for denying delaying or imposing conditions on the approval of the new clearwire license transfers
1953094 the transaction poses no competitive concerns and the public interest strongly weighs in favor of quick commission approval
1953095 frauen wollen es zwar hardcore aber sthetisch verpackt in einem schl ssigen kontext
1953096 weibliche konsumenten achten viel mehr auf details es muss einen spannungsbogen geben frauen geht es vielleicht nicht um eine richtige story ihnen ist es aber wichtig sich mit dem identifizieren zu k nnen was sie sehen und m nner benutzen pornos als kurzfristige onaniervorlage
1953097 m nner sind ja auch feinf hlig wenn sie ihre partnerin f r einen porno gewinnen m chten geht es ihnen um ein gemeinsames erlebnis sonst k nnten sie allein im internet auf gewisse seiten gehen drei minuten gucken
1953098 m nner sollten niemals mit der t r ins haus fallen und einen porno mitbringen der ihnen von einer uninformierten videotheken aushilfe empfohlen wurde es gibt hervorragende internetseiten auf denen erotik filme besprochen werden und eines sollten m nner immer beachten viele frauen stellen sich selbst in frage wenn ihr partner mit einem porno ankommt sie denken jetzt reiche ich ihm nicht mehr und das ist nat rlich quatsch
1953099 gar nicht wenn m nner nur ber ein ansprechendes cover gehen k nnen sie schnell entt uscht werden in keiner branche wird so viel gelogen es f hrt kein weg daran vorbei wer einen guten erotischen film mit sthetischem anspruch sehen m chte muss selbst recherchieren
1953100 sex ist kopfkino und das muss ein erotischer film bedienen pornos d rfen niemanden erniedrigen und dar ber beklagen sich h ufig gerade die frauen dabei hat das mit dem wirklich leben gar nichts zu tun weil es dort die frauen sind die die hosen anhaben in den filmen die ich vertreibe haben immer die frauen die heimliche hauptrolle sie sagen wos langgeht
1953101 oft ja weil sie sich mehr mit dem produkt identifizieren die meisten m nner m ssen vier filme im monat abliefern frauen drehen in der regel alle zwei monate einen sie nehmen sich mehr zeit f r ihren film machen sich gedanken um liebevolle details pornos die von frauen gemacht sind sind in sich runder

1953134 inilah jalan agama ku aku dan orang orang yang mengikutiku berdakwah kepada allah dengan hujjah yang nyata
1953135 dan ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya allah membatasi antara manusia dan hatinya dan ketahuilah bahwa hanya kepada nya kamu akan dikumpulkan di mahsyar
1953136 janganlah kamu mengemukakan udzur kami tidak percaya lagi kepada kamu q s 9 94
1953137 dia memerintahkan mereka berbuat yang makruf dan mencegah yang mungkar menghalalkan bagi mereka segala yang baik dan mengharamkan bagi mereka segala buruk
1953138 maka disebabkan kedzaliman orang orang yahudi kami haramkan atas mereka memakan makanan yang baik baik yang dahulunya dihalalkan bagi mereka
1953139 seluruh makanan adalah halal bagi bani israil melainkan makanan yang diharamkan oleh israil yaqub untuk dirinya sebelum taurat turunkan
1953140 kalian adalah umat terbaik yang dilahirkan untuk manusia menyuruh yang makruf dan mencegah yang mungkar dan beriman kepada allah
1953141 orang orang mukmin laki laki dan orang orang mukmin wanita sebagian mereka adalah pelindung sebagian yang lain memerintahkan yang makruf dan mencegah yang mungkar
1953142 kalian adalah sebaik baik manusia kalian datangi mereka dalam keadaan terbelenggu dan terikat hingga kalian menghantarkannya masuk surga
1953143 yaitu yang mengenal yang makruf dan tidak pula mengingkari kemungkaran
1953144 jagalah dirimu tiadalah orang orang yang sesat itu akan memberi mudharat kepadamu apabila kamu telah mendapat petunjuk
1953145 kalian membaca ayat ini dan meletakkannya bukan pada posisinya dan sungguh aku mendengar nabi saw bersabda
1953146 dan peliharalah dirimu dari siksaan yang tidak khusus menimpa orang orang yang zalim saja diantara kamu dan ketahuilah allah amat keras siksaan nya
1953147 dengan sarana sarana yang terbaik yang tidak mendatangkan hal hal yang lebih buruk darinya
1953148 apabila kerusakan yang akan timbul dari seruan atau pencegahan lebih besar dari kemaslahatannya maka tidaklah ia tergolong yang diperintahkan allah
1953149 sesunguhnya sebuah seruan atau pencegahan betapapun mengandung kemaslahatan serta mencegah kerusakan maka harus dilihat dampak dampaknya apabila kemaslahatan yang akan hilang dan kerusakan yang akan terjadi lebih besar maka ia tidak termasuk yang diperintahkan bahkan menjadi haram apabila kerusakannya lebih besar dari kemaslahatannya akan tetapi tolok ukur maslahat atau kerusakan adalah berdasarkan timbangan syariat apabila seseorang mampu memberlakukan nas nas syariat maka ia tidak boleh berpaling bila tidak maka ia berijtihad untuk menggali sisi kemiripan dan kesepadanan analogi dan sedikit sekali orang orang yang menguasai objektifitas nas nas kesulitan menggali hukum hukum syariat
1953150 ini adalah bab yang sangat agung nilainya ketidakpahaman masalah ini menyebabkan kesalahan yang fatal dalam mengimplementasikan syariat yang menyebabkan kesulitan kesempitan dan beban diatas kemampuan padahal syariat yang selalu meletakkan kemaslahatan pada posisi tertinggi tidak pernah mendatangkan hal ini

1953156 they told us not to pay for any more air tickets and let them know if any new cases come up
1953157 it is a step in the right direction because it is becoming too expensive for us to buy tickets for these people
1953158 it is a fact that more are running away and we have noticed that
1953159 many have never dealt with household gadgets and equipment and are not used to the size of the houses

1953242 we believe that to teach young people critical thinking skills you have to give them both sides of an issue
1953243 but if you look at the american association of university professors definition of academic freedom it refers to the ability to do research and publish
1953244 in high school youre teaching mainstream science so students can go on to college or medical school where you need that freedom to explore cutting edge ideas to apply academic freedom to high school is a misuse of the term
1953245 the religious right has co opted the terminology of the progressive left they know that phrase appeals to people
1953246 teachers shall be permitted to help students understand analyze critique and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories pertinent to the course being taught
1953247 they believe that scientific data related to creationism should be discussed when dealing with darwins theory
1953248 in dover there were parents and teachers willing to step forward and say this is not ok
1953249 but here were seeing that people are either fine with it or they dont want to say anything because they dont want to be ostracised in their community
1953250 this encourages a lot of local brush fires that you have to deal with individually and that makes it very difficult
1953251 this is done intentionally to get this down to the local level its going to be very difficult to even know whats going on

1953262 kabinet yang ditubuhkan menerusi cara itu daripada segi moralnya tidak berkredibiliti parlimen sendiri akan tercemar badan eksekutif dan penggubal undang undang dua cabang penting dalam tabir urus akan dianggap oleh rakyat sebagai institusi yang kehilangan integriti
1953263 saiz dan skala lompat parti yang diusahakannya itu amat sukar hendak dibayangkan pernahkah misalnya terjadi di dalam dunia ini di mana sebuah kerajaan yang mempunyai lebih 58 kerusi daripada gabungan pembangkang berterusan diancam dijatuhkan hanya kerana seorang individu yang malahan tidak berada dalam parlimen sentiasa mendabik dada kononnya jumlah tertentu anggota parlimen akan lompat parti pada tarikh tertentu
1953264 jika ancaman lompat parti terus mengancam ketenteraman negara ia adalah disebabkan ramai rakyat tahu bahawa pada satu ketika dahulu anwar sebagai pemimpin bn dan kerajaan persekutuan telah memainkan peranan penting dalam menjatuhkan kerajaan negeri pbs yang dipilih secara demokrasi di sabah pada 1994
1953265 dalam demokrasi wakil rakyat yang dipilih menerusi platform tertentu perlu mengembalikan mandat itu kepada rakyat dan melepaskan kerusinya sebelum berpaling tadah menyertai parti lain ini yang dikatakan menghormati pengundi

1953268 aufgrund des gro en wachstums das der online bereich immer noch verzeichnet gibt es aus wirtschaftlicher sicht auch heute noch viele m glichkeiten f r internet start ups erfolgreich zu sein
1953269 meiner meinung nach ist es generell sehr schwierig den wirtschaftlichen erfolg im it bereich abzusch tzen
1953270 facebook hat viel geld von investorenseite bekommen aus meiner sicht ist das start up aber derzeit noch weit weg von einem wirtschaftlichen erfolg
1953271 bestes beispiel hierf r ist wikipedia das sicherlich nicht als wirtschaftlicher erfolg zu bezeichnen ist aber dennoch ein sehr gutes projekt darstellt
1953272 die betreiber von bittorrent haben es bislang nicht geschafft ein geeignetes gesch ftsmodell vorzulegen das die basis f r eine erfolgreiche wirtschaftliche entwicklung des projekts darstellen k nnte
1953273 heute wird weit weniger kapital ben tigt um ein internet start up auf die beine zu stellen
1953274 als wichtig erscheint mir in diesem zusammenhang vor allem die vernetzung untereinander wer ber die gr ndung eines start ups nachdenkt sollte mit m glichst vielen leuten aus der branche sprechen und sich auf partnerschaften einlassen zudem sollte man sehr genau auf das feedback aus der internet community h ren und versuchen auf die bed rfnisse der nutzer einzugehen

1953291 we think we can double or triple the employee base there within five years
1953292 we need to look at every aspect of our business to see where we can reduce costs and increase cycle time
1953293 we think this is a win win solution allowing us to continue using the site through covance and keeping our employees working there if they want to
1953294 obviously the hope is that the contract research organizations such as covance can provide a more efficient operation for the industry than big pharma companies can do for themselves

1953311 by the end of the weekend i realized how quaint was the mere suggestion that christians of this type should learn to be rational or set aside your religion about such things as the iraq war or other policy matters once youve made a journey like this once youve gone this far you are beyond suggestible its not merely the informational indoctrination the constant belittling of homosexuals and atheists and muslims and pacifists etc thats the issue its that once youve gotten to this place youve left behind the mental process that a person would need to form an independent opinion about such things you make this journey precisely to experience the ecstasy of beating to the same big gristly heart with a roomful of like minded folks once you reach that place with them youre thinking with muscles not neurons

1953331 going to see my sponsored child in costa rica was a leap into the unknown the young girl i sponsor wanted me to see her house in july which is winter for them it rains every afternoon and cars cant go on the rutted road after it leaves the pavement we must have hiked nearly half a mile up hill in the pouring rain on the last part of the hill there were some concrete block stairs and finally the house which had one light bulb a radio and very little furniture the outer walls were unpainted wood slats the roof was made of rusty zinc and the floor was beaten earth the mom said she had lived there 13 years she said the hardest part of her life was hauling water from a pipe about halfway down the hill and even then the water wasnt safe to drink all you can hope is that the families in the project can move to a better neighborhood since their homes are all wretched and there are a lot of drugs there are a lot of families with children who arent sponsored and mothers come to beg for food for their hungry children i hope my visit will encourage my sponsored child and her family especially her mother and i hope they will be safe all their food and clothing comes from the children incorporated sponsorship program
1953332 we were able to take her gifts and even return a week later on visitor day and meet her step mom they showed us the water supply tanks that children inc has bought for the school i was very proud to meet lucy and the people running the school and i was glad to see my sponsorship dollars at work good work

1953342 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
1953343 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
1953344 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
1953345 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
1953346 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future
1953347 last year it was a very bad situation in baghdad but now it is good
1953348 still there are bombings but we must adapt to this

1953379 i know i didnt even see you get out of bed this morning
1953380 you looked so beautiful in that powder blue nightie i didnt want to wake you
1953381 well i did some cleaning vacummed dusted mopped gonna start dinner i didnt look for a job again
1953382 now honey we discussed this im making a lot of money as a marketing manager there is no pressure to find a job
1953383 i know but i want to be productive and contribute
1953384 you are productive and you do contribute i mean you came out with me to seattle and have worked hard making our place a home youve been doing most of the housework and cooking
1953385 its the least i can do and i dont mind
1953386 yes can i ask what you got planned for dinner
1953387 ok honey i got to call the office now anyway love you

1953389 its ok i like when you do that just as long as you remember to save some for me and remember that i need to do that too
1953390 i find the notion that only koreans are permitted to speak about korean problems simply absurd
1953391 that isnt to say that all foreigners opinions on them are equally valid but if the roles were reversed then id be quite happy to hear the opinions of say a korean person who had spent some time in new zealand and who made an active effort to study and know new zealand society and learn the language
1953392 the majority of netizens aside ive actually found a significant number of koreans to feel much the same way about the opinions of non koreans
1953393 another advantage to using and considering korean language sources as much as possible is that it makes you realize how much you may stereotype and generalize koreans yourself without being aware of it
1953394 without any korean ability foreigners are usually forced to rely on either the limited english language media or books for the bulk of their information and both have problems the former for often presenting a rose tinted version of korea to the world and the latter for being quickly out of date in a country as rapidly changing as korea

1953402 the fact that no team in major league baseball has made an offer for barry even at the minimum salary has created a level of suspicion that is currently being investigated lets look at the facts barry performed admirably in 2007 barry is healthy barry has been offered at the minimum salary and barrys trial date is in march of 2009 so there would be no interruption of the 2008 season it defies explanation as to why he is not employed in 2008 with a major league club

1953588 demi allah tidak tetapi syiah dalam mendukung kesesatan bidahnya menggunakan dalil yang lebih lemah dari sarang laba laba dia orang syiah ini terus menerus membuat pengkaburan terhadap para pembaca bahkan sampai berdusta atas nama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
1953589 orang pertama yang menjadikan batu lempengan dari tanah untuk sujud di atasnya adalah nabi kita muuhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pada tahun ketiga hijriah tatkala terjadi peperangan yang luar biasa antara kaum muslimin dan quraisy pada perang uhud dan gugur pada peperangan tersebut tokoh yang paling agung dalam islam yaitu hamzah bin abdil muthalib paman rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
1953590 perkara tentang pemuliaan hamzah ini berkembang sampai mereka para shahabat mengambil tanah kuburannya untuk meminta berkah dan sujud di atasnya karena allah taala
1953591 dan di antara mereka adalah al faqih al kabir masruq bin al ajda meninggal tahun 62 hijriah seorang tabii besar yang tergolong rijal shihah yang enam
1953592 aku khabarkan bahwa masruq membawa batu lempengan dalam perahu untuk sujud di atasnya
1953593 orang yang hafal sebagai hujjah atas orang yang belum hafal
1953594 tidak akan tegak lurus suatu bayangan sedangkan tongkat itu bengkok
1953595 diriwayatkan dalam shahih bukhari 1 331 bahwasanya nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam membenci shalat di atas sesuatu yang bukan tanah
1953596 ibnu abi syaibah meriwayatkan dari urwah dan az zubair bahwasanya dia membenci shalat atas sesuatu yang bukan selain tanah
1953597 tidaklah seseorang yang mencintaimu kecuali dia adalah seorang mukmin dan tidak membencimu kecuali dia adalah seorang munafik
1953598 membantah ahlul bidah termasuk jihad di jalan allah dan melindungi dari perkara perkara yang bukan dari nya mengarang kitab bantahan dan menyebarkannya adalah haq dan merupakan dakwah kepada kebenaran serta jihad di jalan allah barangsiapa menganggap bahwa mengarang kitab bantahan mencetak dan menyebarkannya adalah bidah maka dia salah
1953599 jangan kamu berbicara dengan mereka dan jangan pula meriwayatkan hadits dari mereka karena mereka adalah pendusta

1953634 this was the sad paradox of solzhenitsyns final years the man who once wrote to soviet leaders demanding the abolition of censorship never protested the revival of censorship the man who used his nobel prize to start a fund for political prisoners kept quiet about the new political prisoners of putins regime the man who coined the slogan to live not by the lie had a cozy relationship with a government that rigged elections and filled the media with lies big and small the man who had once asked the west for more interference in our internal affairs joined the chorus of anti western agitprop
1953635 surging economies in china and india created greater demand for oil middle east instability including threat of war against iran placed future oil supplies in jeopardy the federal governments fiscal irresponsiblity created monetary inflation motivating investors to buy natural resources as a hedge the result oil prices soared meaning gasoline prices soared so what did people do they stopped driving so much gasoline consumption in the u s is down nearly 4 from last year what happened oil speculators perceived the market was peaking and started selling the result lower oil prices leading to lower gas prices

1953670 no paul im not going to heal you it isnt my will in this instance that you be set free from this affliction rather i have a higher purpose in view your humility and my sons glory manifest in the context of your on going weakness
1953671 o k lord ill shut up and submit to your merciful purpose in my life i know you love me and desire what is ultimately of greatest good for my spiritual growth therefore my prayer now is that you maximize in me the beneficial effects of this pain dont let me miss out on any spiritual good that might come my way from this malady teach me everything i need to know and sustain me that i might be a platform for the glory of christ and a source of comfort to other suffering saints

1953674 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity

1953679 il tuo ha un aspetto assolutamente perfetto ma non farei mai a cambio col mio vedi ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho donato il mio amore ho staccato un pezzo del mio cuore e glielho dato e spesso ne ho ricevuto in cambio un pezzo del loro cuore a colmare il vuoto lasciato nel mio cuore ma certo ci che dai non mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi e cos ho qualche bitorzolo a cui sono affezionato per ciascuno mi ricorda lamore che ho condiviso altre volte invece ho dato via pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno corrisposto questo ti spiega le voragini amare rischioso certo ma per quanto dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte nel mio cuore mi ricordano sempre lamore che provo anche per queste persone e chiss forse un giorno ritorneranno e magari colmeranno lo spazio che ho riservato per loro comprendi adesso che cosa sia la vera bellezza
1953680 we have indications of indian involvement with anti state elements in pakistan
1953681 what she was really saying is this we know what the indians are doing theyve sold the americans on the idea that the indians are an authority on pakistan and can be helpful in afghanistan the americans have bought the idea and are in on the plan giving the indians a free hand in afghanistan what the americans dont know is that we too know the indians very well better still we know afghanistan very well you cant beat us at our own game
1953682 a modern rogue army with its finger on the nuclear button
1953683 a large number of isi agents who are responsible for helping the taliban and al qaeda should be thrown in jail or killed what i think we should do in pakistan is a parallel version of what iran has run against us in iraq giving money and empowering actors some of this will involve working with some shady characters but the alternative sending u s forces into pakistan for a sustained bombing campaign is worse
1953684 we should be supplying tens of millions of dollars to build new schools to compete with the madrassas we should be in there building democratic institutions we should be in there and get the rest of the world in there giving some structure to the emergence of hopefully the reemergence of a democratic process
1953685 i think the u s would be wise and i trust we are doing this to have contingency plans to seize pakistans nuclear assets especially because should musharraf fall there are nuclear weapons there
1953686 the dark side sounds sinister so lets call our villains followers of the dark side
1953687 it is easier to point a finger then to lend a helping hand
1953688 because the first recorded sith to use the title were darth revan and darth malak the fact that they derived much of their power from the star forge a creation of the rakata has led some historians to suggest that
1953689 who is doing the searching discovery and what is being discovered
1953690 you dont know what you have until youve lost it
1953691 loneliness is the poverty of self solitude is the richness of self
1953692 yes lord sidious i i have a new assignment for you of course but there is something else as well
1953693 as you know i have spent much time pondering the power of the force i may have some significant insights and more training to share with you upon your return my apprentice
1953694 not everything is light and dark my apprentice some things most things simply are in most ways the force itself is such a thing its conciousness knows neither anthropic term ours is only to use it
1953695 the newly elected rodian senator alula gurit she ran for election pledging to reduce the powers of the office of the chancellor i have foreseen this new senator having some success convincing her colleagues to support her position should she take up her place in the senate
1953696 it is imperative for our future plans that the chancellor retain his current levels of authority gurit must not reach coruscant do you understand my meaning lord sidious
1953697 we are the transition delegation i am the naboos secretary of consular affairs for our coruscant high commission palpatine
1953698 this is representative anjul faraste the chancellors vice whip in the senate who is from corellia im also pleased to introduce deputy ambassador chorele of malastare and i believe you already know outgoing senator dorecus chief of staff eli eleku
1953699 you are quite correct senator i am not as you know one of chancellor pergamums regulatory reforms a nod to the ongoing disputes regarding planetary vs federal powers is to include planetary officials on these briefing delegations the chancellor himself asked me to lead this one and selected deputy ambassador chorele
1953700 thats a half measure cosmetic at best the real problem for planetary rights is the excessive powers of the chancellor himself
1953701 well with the exception of representative faraste senator were not legislators and have no opinion on such matters our briefing will stick strictly to providing you with all the information you need to open your office on coruscant and the protocols you need to be aware of in order to get started
1953702 well begin senator with the budget restrictions for a newly elected senator and the legal implications of your oath of office which you will be taking in two weeks time
1953703 the senator elect is certainly single minded about the chancellors power i find that no opportunity exists to dissuade her from her quest
1953704 it will be necessary to arrange something rodia is outlying enough that a mysteriously destroyed transport would not arrouse suspicion
1953705 on the contrary my apprentice in the political realm any politicians death arrouses suspicion even when there is no reason for it
1953706 lord sidious you effectively used the weakness of others to put yourself in position to survey the senator have you not remember our own history the jedi knew our weakness our inability to share the power of the dark as soon as they realized this they stepped back and allowed us to destroy our own order only darth bane survived
1953707 you can be sure that the rodian senator has a weakness you will find her ruin is right there within her our weakness however is a thing i may have found an end to
1953708 it isnt meant to pain like any other feeling tells you things the pain from your cut is telling you that you are injured just as your good sense should have told you not to pick up that knife you should trust your feelings
1953709 because feelings are the most important conduit we have to the force and like the force our feelings help us to understand our environment heres an example what do you feel about cook
1953710 i feel that cook should stick to naboo food and not make so many offworld things
1953711 and when cook is making naboo dishes what do you feel
1953712 because you have learned what to expect when she does that see you already trust some feelings now come wash up i think cook will be having us soon
1953713 r1 gather any information you can about farre asbec senator gurits opponent in the most recent senatorial election it is necessary to learn just how bitterly contested this campaign was learn who supported each candidate who financed them collect this information and report back to me when you have done so
1953714 how many times need i tell you lord sidious your true weapon is the force your only weapon
1953715 life creates the force life is bound to the force and the force is bound to it the force is everywhere yes it even occupies the space between you and i now reach out to the space between you and i and feel the force see the force can you see it there
1953716 of course you do it permeates it now reach out into the force and fill your heart with anger at the way i just humiliated you
1953717 good good now reach out your hands and fill the space between us with your anger pour it forth like a flood make the force share your righteous fury
1953718 one of the things of which you should be aware senator
1953719 is that the galactic news services are considerably more scandal oriented than the rodian press the holonet in particular can be expected to dig up just about any controversy you have ever been involved in and in turn the rodian press will likely pick up the coverage is that not true eli
1953720 oh im quite sure senator i did not mean to suggest otherwise however perceptions become reality i tell you of this so that you will be prepared for the inevitable they will come investigating
1953721 i suppose my own world is fortunate in this our senate delegation is appointed by the queen
1953722 when i first ran and had just arrived on coruscant my daughter took sick back home on corellia there were a dozen holonet reporters harassing her at her bedside in the hospital asking her to speculate as to whether id poisoned her
1953723 i wonder senator if you would consider allowing the members of the delegation to glance over your campaign contributions
1953724 from experience i would say this is where you will see the most scrutiny with the collective experience of this delegation and your predecessors chief of staff to supervise we would easily be able to identify any potential problems for you
1953725 thank you all i know you are trying to make this easier for me i welcome your assistance my aides will make the records available for you
1953726 now if i may i am quite tired and would like to retire
1953727 i am jedi master sidious sent by the chancellor to speak to you he is aware of your belief that you were unjustly denied in the recent election
1953728 how can i be sure you are really of the chancellor
1953729 you cant publicly the chancellor cannot take sides nor the jedi should you contact them both the chancellor and the council will disavow me
1953730 of course of course dont mistake me i am not ungrateful you came
1953731 the chancellor wishes to know what it is you found objectionable do you suspect senator elect gurit of corruption
1953732 i have no proof of that not direct proof but i have been told by those i trust her mate has been funneled large sums of money from the banking clan and i suspect he intends to spend it on lobbying in the senate despite their conjugal difficulties it is a clear conflict of interest
1953733 not at present i am not of the circles of tetrarchate power as gurit is
1953734 i have learned the republic transition delegation has come into possession of gurits campaign finance records would this help you
1953735 you did not have to arrange her demise after all
1953736 compassion the jedi have no monopoly on it my apprentice if two paths lie before us and one does not require killing then even a sith can take that path all things being equal
1953737 remember my apprentice a sith gains knowledge through power power comes in many forms and i promise you there is no power greater than allowing life to someone whose life or death is in your hands
1953738 yes my master i sense you are greatly troubled about these matters life and death
1953739 i must admit that i am lord sidious i know you think i study in such an abstract way too much i am beginning to think you are right i find i am unable to understand my own insights
1953740 we will discuss these things when you return may your success continue my friend
1953741 i havent spoken to my mate in five months weve been separated for a year this was pure malice malice who did this
1953742 as far as i know none of us did senator
1953743 at this time only your outgoing senate delegation has examined these records and they would be risking severe sanction under rodian law
1953744 the offworlder as you put it was correct not one of them has examined this data i checked the file access logs myself your entire staff has been all over it
1953745 that the republic delegation withdraw for the timebeing these matters are internal rodian affairs and it is gravely important that the republic and sister worlds not be seen to meddle in rodian political affairs
1953746 i do hope this is resolved to your satisfaction i truly am terribly sorry for your troubles
1953747 gurit is trying to blame me as a distraction from her problems that her mate tried to buy her a senate seat with banking clan money may be reprehensible but she has only herself to blame
1953748 my sincere congratulations lord sidious you accomplished your work with great efficiency
1953749 i know not my master she will have a great deal to occupy her time for the foreseeable future
1953750 be careful my apprentice loose ends can be deadly you would be wise to follow her progress
1953751 join me at the usual rendez vous there you shall have your reward my faithful servant
1953752 it is a way of learning without speaking and when you get good at it learning without being spoken to
1953753 not everything we have to learn can be taught to you by people young one some lessons we must teach ourselves and some lessons must be taught to us by the force
1953754 this meditation is perhaps the most practical insight i gained in your absence it was the first of many
1953755 it begins in the same way i instructed you so long ago the force surrounds us it flows like a river around and around us can you see the waves my apprentice
1953756 focus on the waves patiently for they will make themselves known to you now approach them look closer closer pour over every detail in your mind what do you see
1953757 tiny tiny lights floating on every ripple this sea before us is made of them
1953758 yes you are actually looking at the midi chlorians themselves
1953759 yes yes they are now look down see yourself what do you see
1953760 indeed we are made of them our real selves are at any rate now speak to them the ones that you consist of bid them bid them into your very cells to regenerate to recreate with longer telomeres with the self destruction nature builds into us switched off picture your cells your organs renewed recreated and send this image to the little lights working throughout you
1953761 i have done nothing my friend you did this youve given yourself new life i have learned how to cause the midi chlorians to create life life itself it is in our power to use this ability to protect ourselves from the ravages of time
1953762 i want to show you new things my apprentice not wear you out you need not worry i do not intend to bore you to death young one
1953763 you cant bore me to death master jeddu says that jedi cant die and were kind of like jedi arent we
1953764 no one lives forever young palpatine not even sith and i cannot tell you for sure what happens when we do die for i have never died before not so much as once
1953765 both our sith and our jedi forbearers believed that when we die we become one with the force it is not an afterlife like the gungans believe their gods grant them but it does mean we will go on in some way
1953766 you havent spoken to jeddu about the sith have you palpatine for you must tell not a soul
1953767 good good for one day you shall replace me and be master of the sith a great and powerful warrior you will not be able to advance our cause or bring our revenge on the jedi if you have revealed yourself to anyone even jeddu
1953768 i dont want to replace you master what would i do without you and cook
1953769 you will not always feel that way young palpatine too many sith have felt that the dark side does not permit us the luxury of affection my master was very hard on me when i took you in i vowed not to ruin you simply in order to train you
1953770 what i mean is you do not have to stop being who you are in order to be strong or powerful being powerful is why we are sith
1953771 show me this power again master plagueis so that i might understand it better
1953772 it would be better to rest a while the first time i think lord sidious
1953773 i am not fatigued my master i am intrigued i wish to master this ability while it is still fresh in my mind
1953774 very well down into the waves the waves of light inside us we go let me follow you inward
1953775 cancer cells in everyone you found them found them all grew metastasized do even have enough time for a healer do i
1953776 ambition my master for what is power without ambition you have always pressed on me the importance of power power is why we are sith and now i am ready to wield it as the master
1953777 then know this this this was my last test and you failed it
1953778 love i confess i was fond of you it will be unbearable to go on without you but even you must know i would not be your disciple forever
1953779 or is this test of yours something else foresight for i have vanquished yours master
1953780 much there was that i still had to teach you
1953781 it was you wasnt it i dont have to know you i can feel it
1953782 in truth i did little i allowed the weak to learn things about each other
1953783 indeed you are not weak it is because of this that one path set before you tonight will allow you to leave our encounter alive
1953784 i know my feelings you you and they are telling me i want nothing more than to
1953785 then i give you that chance for i can feel your rage see that stone beside you at your feet pick it up i am defenseless cast it at me
1953786 your hands are weak connected to your brain by nothing more than a few weak strands of flesh transmitting your will inefficiently let go your bodily self close your eyes reach for the stone with your hatred and take your first step into a new life
1953787 that was the force like the jedi use wasnt it i could almost see the stone
1953788 and this is only the beginning i can show you such power your strength will dwarf any worldly power you could ever have hoped to gain in the senate you will decide who lives who dies the fate of entire worlds will lie in your hands join me and we will transform the galaxy together
1953789 alula gurit is dead that weak self is no more you have a new name one befitting your newfound strength
1953790 you are darth malous dark lord of the sith and my apprentice i have much to teach you now rise my friend
1953791 what truly differentitiates the sith from the jedi is our philosophy and our way of understanding the force
1953792 art embodies the thought and philosophy of a civilization gives it a form
1953793 darkness calls to darkness it calls to you you can feel it like a heart beating within this temple how will you respond
1953794 tell me what you regard as your greatest strength so i will know how best to undermine you tell me of your greatest fear so i will know which i must force you to face tell me what you cherish most so i will know what to take from you and tell me what you crave so that i might deny you
1953795 man i am glad i have a house what would i do if i was that guy without
1953796 why do you call me brother wolf i am not like you i am a sheep like the others
1953797 what do you mean brother you are a wolf how can you think to be of the sheep
1953798 i was born within the heard wolf i have always been a sheep as my parents before me
1953799 look into the water brother then you will see that you are of my kind and not of the sheep
1953800 i do not need to look into the water for i would only see my reflection the same face i see in the sheep around me i do not need to look i am of the sheep
1953801 and what of the grass you eat brother wouldnt a sheep be more to your liking
1953802 i have always eaten grass and i know no other to desire a sheep is against the law
1953803 yet you have considered eating one of the sheep havent you
1953804 no i would never think such a thing and it would be appreciated if you leave us for you are making the heard nervous
1953805 i thought i might show you around the caves a bit before taking you in to meet my family
1953806 the mine does sound very interesting master are those mynocks the ones you spoke of
1953807 hah no those were a sapient and highly advanced variant species and they are now extinct this is a comparatively ordinary infestation that moved in during my absence for training but i permit it out of curiosity they shouldnt be able to survive without the starlight unless they are also tapping into the same energies mynocks that feed on the dark side of the force a very clever and curious adaptation most nonsapient force using species are essentially neutral
1953808 of course theyre also not supposed to be in the hangar very bad for maintenance clear them out for me will you and find the breach that let them in
1953809 i wont have to forgive you for anything if you obey me apprentice
1953810 master you are not what i expected of a sith master
1953811 well thats interesting please elaborate what did you expect fewer mynocks
1953812 what then i know you spent time with my own master and with his i also know i am not much like either of them but then i gather they were also very different from one another
1953813 i did not expect all of this the mine yes perhaps a fine home perhaps but less talk of family fewer pictures of your grandchildren less talk of of of principles
1953814 the dark side is a path to power the sith have goals as a group to be sure but we are not self abnegating jedi why shouldnt i enjoy life i happen to like my grandchildren
1953815 and yet youre raising them in an area known for producing insanity
1953816 that was due to the spirits of the ancient mynocks i have that situation under control
1953817 how shall i say it you speak in the language of morals master of the soft people
1953818 you are too used to the idea that morals and principles are for the weak i think certainly to take what you want when you want it is often an option and one of the benefits of power but what you must keep in mind if you want to be truly effective is that much of what beings say they do for the sake of morals of principles of good and right much of this actually has very practical reasons
1953819 how can that be all of it seems to be about not taking advantage of people
1953820 no apprentice its about mutual advantage if you are honest and reliable you will be trusted if you are kind people will be well disposed toward you
1953821 not if you have the power to back it up apprentice tell me this why did you not kill the mynocks when i told you to get rid of them for me
1953822 you said i had done well master i believed you satisfied
1953823 and so i was i still want you to explain your reasoning
1953824 it was more efficient master making them flee showed me where the breach was accomplishing your other assignment
1953825 you do realize the sith are currently a secret dont you apprentice thats another reason to conduct ourselves as honorably as possible the more truth you put into a lie the more believable it is and the less you have to remember good behavior on our part avoids suspicion and allows us to amass advantages for future generations
1953826 future generations you imply youre speaking of future sith but i think you mean your own offspring you talk of these practical advantages but you still speak of your principles as if you value them for their own sake and then justify them good honor honesty love where is your sense of strife master
1953827 do you dispute my right to my own passions apprentice
1953828 no but i find the old masters choice a puzzling one
1953829 well then becoming my apprentice was a strange move now wasnt it
1953830 no master clearly you were chosen for a reason and that means i have much to learn from you but i am still perplexed i served your master yes and his too neither offered me more than minimal training certainly neither ever offered to make me his apprentice i followed all the teachings they would offer me as well as i could and when the old man was dead you arrived
1953831 well i have it now dont i i wanted to be the apprentice but i do not understand why you were chosen
1953832 perhaps you should reflect on the reasons you were not
1953833 i suggest you begin with your impatience and lack of subtlety also your poor acting
1953834 that persistence and commitment deserve a reward a chance at least
1953835 so youre essentially rewarding me for loyalty and hard work
1953836 are you suggesting my apprenticeship was on a trial basis
1953837 id be willing to break tradition if you are though i dont suppose youd accept a generous severance package in lieu of my killing you quietly
1953838 i will not give up the opportunity to be a sith so easily
1953839 youve passed the test it would have been a real pity if youd accepted
1953840 bit of a mess dont worry ive already dispatched the maintenance droids
1953841 i wanted to but he was called away at the last minute here id better go change clothes before i stink up the whole atmosphere in here
1953842 how would you like to start spending more time with your grandfather
1953843 just how important is the tradition about killing your master it seems inefficient i still have much to learn
1953844 but apprentice you may enjoy affection but shouldnt let it blind you that is more of a danger with us perhaps than with sith in less comfortable positions now think the apprentice attacks when he believes he has surpassed his master do you believe this
1953845 even if i did master i think i would say no
1953846 besides im an old man this may or may not be a standard teaching but id say the rite of passage is less important than learning when to let circumstances do your work for you
1953847 you have many questions boy i know and you may ask of me whatever you wish tonight you may ask until you lose breath or pass out or both if you can you may continue spending questions till the northern sun rises and if you raise me off the cot and speak without that stutter i may even bother to answer some of them
1953848 long ago boy long long ago the sith were more than what you see before you we were a grand empire we stretched half the galaxy in glory and splendor our palaces shone as the sun our temples were revered our fortresses unyielding our subjects loved us and honored us as we brought wealth and peace to any planet we touched we counted in the billions
1953849 the jedi saw what we had done and grew jealous and fearful they took it upon themselves to attack us just as they had done innumerable times before in wars long past and we fought back of course but they had greater numbers and they had the support of planets even some of our own
1953850 they made whole planets of people traitors through the force
1953851 if only it had been that simple boy but no for you see the jedi would never do such a thing with the force because the jedi fear the force it is in their nature
1953852 i dont understand what aspect of the force do they fear
1953853 all of it everything they use they regret using even if its for the good of others they consider it regrettable a necessary evil two inches higher child youre waning good they believe the force is inherently dangerous close your eyes
1953854 we were systematically killed at first the battles were like those in any war confusing bloody chaotic a theater of the absurd the grand comedy
1953855 but eventually after years or perhaps decades the war quit being a war and became a massacre
1953856 was one birth name lost to the ages his taken name was bane a lord he was an intelligent man who knew when to fight and when to run he understood that if he ran out to the enemy for honor and death it would mean the death nail for our order as well he was it and its entire history lay with him so he hid and survived that is why i even exist it is why many people exist who would otherwise not it is why you are here with me and not withering away on dolus laboring in that sweatshop
1953857 but why did he take only one apprentice why not two or three why not why not a whole academy
1953858 because he saw how the jedi used their numbers against them unlike the jedi who operate better as a mindless collective of enforcers the sith embody the ideal of the individual he had seen his foes turn this into a weapon and wished to avoid a repeat occurrence darth bane doubted that the order could survive another massacre not everyone you see could be trusted to be as smart as he
1953859 so he distilled everything down in favor of proficiency and survival over coherency and propagation
1953860 you mean that while the existence of only one student meant the lessons would get changed many times over they were rarely forgotten or ignored because the student would always be at least a little interested
1953861 and even though almost nothing was spread or is ever spread about the sith today their presence will never vanish because finding two people in a galaxy full of people is impossible
1953862 if we need to stay hidden why are you teaching me this what use will i have for a skill ill never use
1953863 mere application is never the only use of knowledge remember this but you get ahead of yourself being skilled in good swordsmanship will come in quite handy in a practical way jedi are not your only enemy some are nemeses from ages past some are new and temporary but you must know how to dispatch them all and efficiently
1953864 what other enemies do the sith have if they stay so well hidden
1953865 child we hide but not in holes our presence is felt often throughout the galaxy and strongly just not in connection with our religion we prefer to make our difference within the playground the jedi play in rather than against it the political arena
1953866 it was a fortunate title which i inherited others in past generations have had to work for their status you will find soon enough that great good can be done through seemingly inconsequential acts if done in the right place and with the right title upon your name
1953867 you ask as though you fear this boy dont it is a natural occurrence you can make no public decision without someone disagreeing with you and you can make no successful public decision without someone hating you it is a fact you must embrace and exploit for avoidance will only make things worse avoidance is the jedi way they have enemies they do not even know and still more we have few and we know each and every one even
1953868 of course you do boy more than even one in fact you know this even without knowing it you are suspicious and tense and it is because of your enemy that you feel this way speed up boy youre taking too long
1953869 it is always there every time you close your eyes even now
1953870 i said id answer any question you ask and i intend to extend that courtesy for the duration of this trip starting tomorrow there are some things that are better explained by the light of day furthermore you need your rest there is much about combat that i intend for you to learn this week much
1953871 i know well talk about it on the way today begins your real training with the sword after this week i suspect you may even be ready to wield your very own lightsaber
1953872 the will of the force is mysterious to us young one
1953873 but what would its will be that it requires the suffering of others
1953874 i dare say child that the force never requires anything it is ours alone to either choose to do its will or not
1953875 is it also the weathers choice to cause hurricanes then and the mantles choice to erupt volcanoes
1953876 those things have no free will to make choices with they are just a few of the side effects of our beautiful universe and they must be respected and understood
1953877 but what if youre a tribal village that doesnt know anything about hurricanes and volcanoes how can the force expect us to respect and understand what we dont even know exists if those things have no free will shouldnt the force step in and be their will and do the right thing by avoiding crowded beaches and populated islands
1953878 see this we aint doin you no favors payin this for you youre gonna be here till youre sixty paying this off ya hear me
1953879 names are not given boy they are found at birth or they are taken there are no other options one day perhaps you will be ready to take one but not today
1953880 the jedi do they do this stuff too or is sword fighting just something a sith bothers to learn
1953881 oh the jedi learn this in fact they devote most of their lives to mastering one martial art or another even some very aggressive ones never underestimate the jedi boy
1953882 there is a datapad in there somewhere find it without looking or putting your hands inside
1953883 you see sparring with sabers no matter the kind is not actually an art the sith created or will truly ever own to be honest it has always been a jedi thing their way of feeling superior to the masses i suppose given that they restrict themselves from showing off their own obvious arrogance in every other way we simply use it as another tool in our arsenal this one specific to dealing with other jedi of course
1953884 so these lessons are really unimportant then outside of keeping me on par with what the jedi can do
1953885 careful boy these particular lessons may not be some exemplification of the sith way but they are still drastically important
1953886 but the purpose of this trip couldnt be explicitly for training me in the sword could it you would want me to learn something deeper than that wouldnt you
1953887 you told me the other day that you knew about my shadow beast
1953888 you can keep it make sure to recharge it when we get back and its yours
1953889 as much as you dear that is where it hunts you is it not inside yourself
1953890 then how could i possibly know any information outside of what sits within that clever little brain of yours the answers are there waiting you need to take those answers yourself you cant rely on me for that because if you let me find your answers if you let
1953891 come back at the first light of the following morning with its head and ill let you in
1953892 what my daddy calls the sun that lights up the underlevels
1953893 then how come when im on top i only ever see one going across the sky
1953894 it doesnt go across the sky stupid we go around it thats what my gramma said
1953895 i just want to help my names level see i wont hurt you itll be okay yeah
1953896 what the kriff are you doing draggin a useless nine year old here eh lev we have troubles enough without this shavit grow some freakin durasteel over that damn heart of yours before it gets us kriffin killed
1953897 and what eat it good for her lots of protein in rats i hear is this shavit supposed to move me
1953898 aw boo hoo i got no food waa waa look at me im forced to eat rats
1953899 i lived on rats for three nordus damned years before moving up
1953900 that maybe the useless got some durasteel of her own eh
1953901 you need a good name to ride with us this aeona business sounds too weak yknow we need something threatening yeah yeah
1953902 mice are poisonous mutants you cant eat them and very hard to catch so are you sure about that
1953903 well maybe so but you did have a fever and
1953904 have you ever killed anyone or anything in your life where you didnt care who or what it was ever
1953905 youre at the ground floor looking up at the largest building on the entire planet its a sight few beings ever get to see
1953906 i am jedi master baruuk and this is my padawan sifo dyas
1953907 we sensed your presence from almost a mile away mouse it isnt often that a non jedi so strong in the force is found wandering this close to the temple
1953908 mouse not a name parents tend to give children do you have another
1953909 i suspect you lost it when you lost someone close hm
1953910 im im afraid not youd be much too old but there are many non jedi in the order some of whom came from a situation just like your own we only want to help you you would have a better life i can promise that
1953911 they they went that way into those apartment buildings you poor thing you must be oh oh child come back
1953912 and i want to help you bury your friends you should not have to do such a terrible thing on your own
1953913 you tell me the place lead me and i carry them there you must know of someplace were bodies can be sealed up yes
1953914 will i carry them ohhhh youll see come help me with this and show me the way
1953915 you saved my life child when you could have easily left me to die i want to reward you what would you like what do you want
1953916 weve arrived mouse this is wayland up ahead is the fortress ive had built
1953917 never mind you will land ahead of me i have business to take care of at waylands capital give this letter to the door guards and theyll relay your instructions
1953918 aeona dray lady averus she shows great promise and id like to take her under my wing if her ladyship approves
1953919 it is fitting that the building was completed by one
1953920 never mind honestly i never really cared about the project much
1953921 you dedicated a lot of time to it for something you dont care about
1953922 because this wasnt about me this was about our order and showing respect to it for that we dedicate our lives respecting the order is the most important thing you must remember child how long our memories will live on in history will depend entirely on how much of that respect we show and that is the truth
1953923 you will never know why she is kind to him because youve never known kindness
1953924 i need to just kill him and get this over with
1953925 they are more clever than you think do not test their perceptions frivolously
1953926 it sounds like just a derisive way of saying the same thing i said
1953927 watching implies the two of you are equals each with his own will gawking on the other hand implies that you are the better and the other possesses no will at all you watch a ship take flight but you gawk if it crashes
1953928 you cannot see it but there is a web there pinning her the wisp spider only eats pixie moths nothing else a pixie moth holds still only twice ever in her lifetime when she gives birth and when she dies if she is still at any other moment its because she is trapped in a wisp spiders invisible net there is never any other reason
1953929 we are about to see the final moments of this poor creatures life im afraid
1953930 this seems like as good a place as any to conduct todays lessons all that heat has kept us stuck inside for so long so shall we start back up on precision i expect you to be able to target objects with the force as far away as two hundred meters by weeks end
1953931 the moth hm not with that tone we wont be
1953932 baroness i do not wish to be impertinent but if we do nothing it will die
1953933 and tell me boy do you think she would approve of being called an it after you do this saving perhaps this poor creature would rather die than be saved by someone so pretentious hm
1953934 if i ever learn to talk to them maybe ill find that stuff out as it stands ill have to content myself with being pretentious if thats what it takes to keep this one alive
1953935 the best way to do it is to remove the strands with the force otherwise theyll stick and the spider will follow the scent of its net until it recaptures the creature
1953936 the spider its making its way up those little branches over there
1953937 yeah i see it i know theres a time limit i get it
1953938 the spider it is a long and difficult task you know catching a pixie moth ive studied them in my time it could take weeks for him to find another it probably took weeks to get this one he is starving and there is no chance hell have the strength to wait again
1953939 which means hes going to starve to death after the moth is free
1953940 its not my fault the only thing he eats is pixie moths
1953941 so if i save the pixie moth the wisp spider dies if i do nothing the pixie moth dies baroness i do not think you could have invented a better moral conundrum if you tried
1953942 thats because conundrums arent my forte theyre natures id rather just teach you how to get better at levitation and precision to be very honest
1953943 well theres no good answer here anyway you said so yourself the only conclusions will result in death requiring you to choose who lives and who dies which amounts to playing god something ive always been against so there you have it
1953944 the third option from the way i see it would be to go out and find a pixie moth you like less than this one catch it and replace that one for this one you still play god boy and something still dies not ideal in the least
1953945 i dont follow its just another part of the circle of life or what have you i imagine
1953946 yes but shouldnt there be a specific reason they absolutely need to eat pixie moths and only pixie moths theres something unique in their biology or chemistry or something there has to be
1953947 i dont say so the spider says so every time he refuses to eat other passing insects you said they could starve to death trying to catch the moths yet there are all kinds of life much weaker and easier to catch all over the place if there is truly one specific thing they can only get out of the pixie moth then what would happen if we provided them with that nutrient or mineral or vitamin or whatever if we figured out what it was and isolated it in order to manufacture it on a larger scale perhaps fusing the data into the dna of common fungus spores then the wisp spider will never have to kill these beautiful creatures again
1953948 yeah this one would not live to see the benefit
1953949 ah so the real question is will they survive the inevitable and devastating overpopulation after their one and only predator has been made to lose interest
1953950 the universe can be an exceedingly difficult thing to reshape
1953951 the spider and the moth it might not have much to do with refining your precision but it does serve as an important lesson dont you think it is a good analogy to the greater world i could almost imagine some kind of complicated childrens story being invented around the problem but you must understand something
1953952 and this is in case youre frustrated and think you should give up your little random thought experiments because you shouldnt but you need to understand if you become my apprentice this question will need an answer that does work and on a much much larger scale
1953953 i know because the sith order expects no less than uhm than complete mastery of power in all its forms
1953954 but do you truly believe this boy or are you just trying to impress me
1953955 not bad dreams laa i dreamed i was back home
1953956 my name is rain i mean zannah my cousins used to call me rain but theyre dead now zannahs my real name
1953957 do you know the ways of the force do you understand the true nature of the dark side
1953958 but you can teach me im young i will learn
1953959 the sith are the sworn enemies of the jedi knights some people know them as their evil counterpart
1953960 i wasnt very formally trained as a jedi so i dont know much at all i dont even have a lightsaber of my own
1953961 in time all you wish to know will become yours
1953962 you may have heard what i am about to tell you from the jedi if you still choose to believe them then so be it i am not forcing you to do anything rain im only giving you certain tools in the hope that you will carry on my teachings throughout the ages however if you are not up to the challenges i place before you i hate to say you will meet an untimely end
1953963 my name is zannah rain is a childs name i am no longer a child
1953964 by giving you a brief summary of what led to the battle of ruusan
1953965 all sith vie for power this struggle is inevitable and it has plagued the teachings of the sith since the death of the true race
1953966 when the nature of the dark side was first formulated into a kind of teaching it was with the race of sith beings who had a strong control over the dark side
1953967 because of the dark sides rash nature it breeds the lust for power inside those who use it as im sure you felt back on ruusan anger built up inside of you anger hate rage these are all tools of the dark side however there are many other emotions that can spur the dark side instead of hate there is love which leads to attachment something the jedi fear almost more than anything else
1953968 a jedi would look at me and name me evil because of what i represent
1953969 in the past nearly all sith lords have used the dark side to create great distress throughout the galaxy all trying to gain more power for themselves
1953970 lord kaan and the brotherhood of darkness did not understand this and would not believe or accept it
1953971 although i played a major role in its destruction their downfall was because of their ignorance and their lust for power do not be mistaken zannah i wish for power as well but the power i seek is not the domination of the galaxy or the enslavement of others whom i command the dark side bends at my will and because of my power i force its corruption away from me the power does not blind me into rash madness but because of my control over it it focuses me on my goal
1953972 but i thought you said your power was not to destroy other lives
1953973 in time the sith will have the potential to be the most powerful force in the galaxy we will be able to reform the galactic orders creating an age where war will finally cease
1953974 the jedi will stop at nothing to destroy the sith if they discover so much as an inkling of our presence they will be dispatched to rid the galaxy of us their order blinds them from seeing our true path no matter how far it strays from the teachings of the jedi
1953975 the future is a blur to all who try to read it for those skilled in seeing the visions of what will happen it is still an enduring task for them to accomplish in most cases one will see many possible futures but never one definite future i cannot tell you with assurance what will happen after the jedi order is destroyed my time in the galaxy is not to determine the fate of the jedi only the fate of the sith
1953976 so you believe that youre only an instrument to move towards the greater good
1953977 i always asked them what would happen when i became a jedi what would happen between the three of us whenever i tried to make up a future it never worked out i even envisioned the fate of the planet ruusan now i know that it was silly to even try after what happened to my shuttle i even tried to picture myself and laa together in the jungle in peace
1953978 as far as you know the jedi might still be around for thousands of years after you die even after i die
1953979 it is useless to attack the jedi by force if one hopes to be successful they must employ all the aspects of the dark sides nature not just its power
1953980 deception is also useful do you understand why so many sith have failed in the past
1953981 they didnt stop and think about what they were doing
1953982 youre close zannah they rushed into action their hatred blinding them instead of fueling them
1953983 power is regained throughout generations only because of the strictness of its teachings
1953984 i could not simply tell you of the dark side and hope for you to control it
1953985 the sith cannot survive with large numbers as i have just explained
1953986 if you have any doubts about your training then the legacy of the sith is not for you to behold but if you choose now to follow me there is no turning back
1953987 all sith forces in the ruusan system have been destroyed space forces received no word from the brotherhood of darkness positioned on ruusans surface and after crippling strikes from the jedi and the republic we were forced to retreat this message has been sent to all known sith controlled territories in an attempt to gather all remaining sith troops we are heading to the undisclosed safe zone prepared to rendezvous with what remains of the sith armada if one of us is receiving this message then youll know where to find us as per instructed we await the orders of the brotherhood admiral pilian out
1953988 you had us for a real scare there little girl
1953989 we came back to the academy to find the masters but didnt expect it to be abandoned
1953990 were trying to reorganize the sith forces were headed to jagas cluster
1953991 ole le ola la brasil vem a o bicho vai pegar
1953992 therefore the master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything
1953993 there is a difference between knowing the path and walking the path
1953994 what is within your skin is under your control whats outside of you isnt
1953995 i am the dread in my enemies hearts i am the shade in the night that vanishes whenever one turns ones head i am the ever burning vengeful hatered that does not consume but strengthens i am the heart of darkness master and i am yours
1953996 he is a wanderer an outcast he has some power in the force but he is shunned by the jedi and he has had no jedi training
1953997 his name is darovit i want you to find him and kill him
1953998 he wanders the deserts of ruusan look for him there
1953999 i will hold on to this for you until you get back
1954000 i have to talk to her i have to at least try to change her even if it is hopeless
1954001 i never left i have found my peace in the deserts with the few bouncers that survived
1954002 nevermind the hand ive gotten used to it and you did what you had to do that sith would have killed me otherwise
1954003 im not sure i shouldnt just have killed you instead that sith is my master and you will speak of him with respect
1954004 so my lady may i ask what it is that brings you to this planet
1954005 you know these wastes well you will be my guide
1954006 i am looking for a man you must have ran across him once or twice his name is darovit
1954007 but the battle of ruusan is not yet over the legacy of the sith still lives on on ruusan
1954008 tomcat the traitor who killed general kiel charny has arisen as the new dark lord of the sith
1954009 i belive that you are too hasty in making your conclusions vandara we are yet to learn the reason behind the dirsturbance at ruusan what makes you think that tomcat is behind this
1954010 i have learnt from many reliable sources that he is on ruusan he now goes by the name of darovit the murderer of charny have to be brought to justice
1954011 this is why you are not on the council vandara
1954012 you take lightsaber burns on corpses and the man who killed kiel charny thirteen years ago and you get a new dark lord of the sith tomcat was just a child when he betrayed us and he was never strong in the force we have heard nothing of him for thirteen years and now you suddenly figure that he has recreated the sith order
1954013 tomcat should be brought to our justice and the disturbance at ruusan should be looked into we are sending you and your padawan to investigate and take care of this matter but this will not become one of your ghost hunts
1954014 yes master thank you master i will leave at once
1954015 are you sure that was a good idea master cognius
1954016 yes vandara always sees enemies where there are none he is a warrior and he has trouble accepting that the galaxy is at peace at last
1954017 lets just hope that he does not live up to our expectations
1954018 even if tomcat has declared himself dark lord of the sith he is no threat to vandara our best and far too eager warrior he and his padawan will not fail
1954019 do you really think that the sith are behind this master
1954020 a jedi would truely need to have fallen very far to be able to preform such atrocities
1954021 they have always been and will always remain and we will always be there to fight them
1954022 the council likes to think that the galaxy is at peace at last they dare not to accept the truth the sith is still out there hiding biding their time that is why im not on the council young padawan the council fears the truth
1954023 give me one reason why i should not kill you where you stand
1954024 well he seems awfully popular these days there was a woman here asking for him not so long ago and they left together into the desert
1954025 well she looked human surely enough but she had yellow eyes and pale skin she might have been a cross breed of some sort she was dressed all in black too looked dangerous yknow
1954026 no she did not not that i saw at least
1954027 i told you out into the desert theres nothing out there they did go west though that much i know
1954028 we are all alone on this one until we bring proof of the siths continued existence then they will have to admit their mistake and put me on the council where i belong
1954029 master i think we should just calm down and think this over
1954030 there is no time for that we have to catch that woman before she escapes us
1954031 you are under arrest for the murder of kiel charny and for treason against the jedi order
1954032 come to your senses those green creatures are influencing our minds take them down
1954033 did you know that there are precisely twohundred and six bones in the human body
1954034 darovit is dead and you are finally one with the dark side
1954035 you have done well you have passed my test and reached the full extent of your power
1954036 your hate has made you powerful i am proud of you

1954138 at that point the investigation still had a long way to go
1954139 i think what youre asking sir answers the question itself

1954146 nature growth life the delicate dance of reproduction and evolution game developers are nursing some creative and compelling new gameplay out of mother natures mulch q games
1954147 we dont like making anything that is normal or expected of us
1954148 i started q games about seven years ago because i wanted to try and make games in my own style and i found i couldnt do that while i was working at a publisher
1954149 the reason being is that i dont pay much attention to what the consumer wants i am a bit selfish and simply make the games that i find cool and that i want to make and this quite often doesnt gel well with mass market publishing

1954151 family oriented services are garnering a huge interest in the wireless industry today as carriers are looking to tap the capacity of this potential gold mine
1954152 theres not an incredible lot of growth left in the teen market 13 to 17 year olds because the overall wireless market in the u s has been slowing down during the past few years
1954153 so there has been a lot of focus on targeting teens through the family plans that carriers offer verizon and at amp t in particular have very strong market share with their family plans its basically a bucket of minutes that can be shared across all of the members of your family for an add on cost of 10 for each line it has been an incredibly successful way to target the teen market so much so that 85 percent of teens are on family plans
1954154 what becomes a bit more of a struggle with the tween market is that obviously the tweens arent going to buy the cell phones themselves the decision making process is virtually 100 percent in their parents hands so its a matter of do parents think their child needs a cell phone
1954155 the other question beyond that is parents have a fear of overage charges and ask if i get my child a cell phone is my cell phone bill going to be 500 a month

1954172 elecam executive are not going to be directly implicated in the organisation of election the election exercise is going to be directly organised by the ministry of territorial administration and decentralisation minatd as usual thereby rendering the so called independent electoral body somehow dependent
1954173 elecam must be amended for the citizens to have confidence in the structure
1954174 it is illegal for the government to approve any church since we are in a democratic society and are free to worship who and whatever we believe in even if it is a stone if the government thinks that approving a church is the best way to mould citizens why not do same for occultism
1954175 but our main aim is to prevent souls from damnation and we cannot fold our arms to wait for government while gods children perish in sin it is better to do the work to please god than man made government
1954176 i am the founder of this institution which is the best way of serving god
1954177 it is useless claiming that they are the ones sent by god when they go about disturbing public peace extorting money from people and even abusing them sexually it even went to the extent that we had to ban one anonymous so called churches in metta quarters bamenda for disturbing public order and because of the many poor reports recorded about the pastor in this institution
1954178 according to me these churches should all be banned but since we work under the ministry no decision can be taken as to what should be done to them
1954179 what i want is the truth come to me my door is open do not publish what you know is not true
1954180 this forest is for wwf one of the most important places on earth it is at the cutting edge of conservation for this organisation
1954181 this is a place with stunning resources the only place where you can see lowland gorillas and forest elephants but more broadly a real spectacular forest from a biodiversity perspective
1954182 working at the highest levels with heads of states and foreign partners and at the same time working with local communities to try and find solutions which can sustain conservation in the long term so it is a flagship programme for our organisation
1954183 it is not something i see every day it is a wonderful landscape the gorillas are so special i have not seen gorillas for quite sometime so that was very special
1954184 i think there is a deep understanding within this organisation that conservation can only be successful if it works for people in particular who live in the areas we are trying to protect that we are broadly working for society we have recognised that for a very long time and the strategy that you now see developing in the congo basin for the amazon for the coral triangle and so on are focused on finding lasting solutions and lasting solutions means solutions that work for the people
1954185 the difference i see here is in the effort to integrate the local communities into the solution and also to enable sustainable economic activities to be carried out
1954186 that is the real future for a lot of protected areas
1954187 you cannot expect people to change their behaviours when they are not able to feed or send their children to school or have a better life i am very gratified to see how integrated the community leaders are in this project
1954188 is a ground breaking programme working with communities and working on the environment where the needs of the communities are so pre eminent
1954189 the meetings i had 18 months ago in yaounde obviously indicate to me that there is a real promise here you see some particular governments very serious about conservation and about really taking a leadership role in deciding how forest management can be done one of our tasks is to make sure that we are supporting those who want to do things the right way those who want to really find good solutions and to help make sure that they are successful we should not miss that opportunity here in cameroon
1954190 i think everyone recognises that this programme has been very successful in all aspects on developing skills within the communities on promoting cooperation amongst countries on protecting the environment and raising awareness i really think we are going to continue to support it

1954203 history is such a rich and surprising living ongoing thing its not dead the experiences we have today are directly connected to things that happened a long time ago if you really look hard at the threads and its very relevant to human experience economically socially artistically militarily now i think weve lost a lot of the appreciation of it theres so much to learn that is relevant to daily life and a vision for the future by analyzing what happened in the past and understanding that everybody had a different experience of history within their own context and there cant be any gross simplifications you have to study it up close in detail we live in a drive through culture and you cant really pick up everybodys true story in a drive through blur
1954204 we had read a lot of historical fiction stories when we were in middle school and junior high then we decided we wanted to do a little more than just read about history we wanted to dress up and relive what they went through
1954205 if we see some early success from the americans thats a good sign i think the countrys looking for something to rally behind
1954206 its almost like divine intervention that it worked out that way
1954207 and when you add to that our womens gymnastics team is the best weve ever sent to a games and they are rivaled by the chinese its going to be a fierce fight

1954210 if youre benchmarking against third quarter primetime network television this thing is going to look great

1954213 its not like theyre rolling over big numbers on this one

1954372 science programs often pretend to be career oriented but they should be knowledge oriented the main goal should be to teach students how to think and not how to work at a bench thus students who graduate from an undergraduate or graduate program will have valuable skills that they can use in any career they choose

1954379 the overall evidence is consistent with the view that sox negatively affected cross listed premia and particularly hurt riskier firms and firms from well governed countries while perhaps helping high growth firms from poorly governed countries

1954386 trinity was an innocent and random victim of identity theft apparently so were four or five other county residents whose names and addresses were stolen and used as addresses on drug packages
1954387 however trinity and our family have not been treated as victims of a crime instead our home was invaded our two beloved labrador retrievers are dead my mother in law and i were tied up for nearly two hours
1954388 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1954389 we could have gotten the mayor to put the dogs away and consent to a search
1954390 i would have let them stay in a yard by themselves with those dogs
1954391 it really upsets me to think that i dont feel safe in my home if they were to shoot our dog amber i would be outraged

1954393 however no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen not even the angels in heaven or the son himself only the father knows
1954394 when the son of man returns it will be like it was in noahs day
1954395 two men will be working together in the field one will be taken the other left two women will be grinding flour at the mill one will be taken the other left
1954396 so you too must keep watch for you dont know what day your lord is coming
1954397 however no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen not even the angels in heaven or the son himself only the father knows and since you dont know when that time will come be on guard stay alert
1954398 the coming of the son of man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip when he left home he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return you too must keep watch for you dont know when the master of the household will return in the evening at midnight before dawn or at daybreak dont let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning i say to you what i say to everyone watch for him
1954399 he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea

1954411 eva perez de vega steele and ian gordon present choreographing space an interdisciplinary collaboration that explores the intersection of architecture dance and moving image by enveloping the interior space at 145 nassau with an interactive mesh capable of transformation the project becomes both architectural space and performance event that engages dance performers and viewers oscillating between static and dynamic states
1954412 in the world of architecture you can also experience delightful examples of subtle variation within strict regularity it may be a tow of houses in an old street where dwellings of the same types and period were built individually with the framework of a general plan these houses too are variations on a theme within a rectilinear pattern
1954413 t here is something mysterious about the stimulating effect of rhythm rhythmic motion gives a feeling of heightened energy often top it occupies the performer without any conscious effort on his part so that his mind is free to wander at will a state very favorable to artistic creation
1954414 if we believe that the object of architecture is to provide a framework for peoples lives then the rooms in our houses and the relation between them must be determined by the way we will live in them and move through them
1954415 i f baroque and rococo ornamentation can be said to naturalize architecture softening and even melting the hard surfaces and rectilinear forms then the formal garden with its strict geometries can be said to make nature architectural and like al the rooms of the palace the spaces of the garden lead us in circles resnaiss camera traces the path of lifelike ornament as it develops and dissolves conversations among characters loop endlessly and the geometric gardens lead nowhere to stagnation the camera continually glides toward some destination that it never will reach
1954416 photography with its abilty to produce pictures with wholly accurate proportions and precise representation of details was ideally suited to the rendering of architecture architecture was in turn an ideal subject
1954417 biased though it is the sample is interesting the pictures dont just represent their subject matter they suggest a way of looking at the world of their kind they are extreme grand perfect ruined beautiful but sometimes uncomfortable or upsetting and of their time they are profoundly iconoclastic though the passage of time and frequent reproduction always tend to erode this effect they are heroic a world view polemic offered in a single frame they tell us not only how the world might be but how me see it
1954418 from the effort made by photographers between 1839 and 1880 there would evolve a photographic language that would express architectural forms with the vividness and precision of the older forms of architectural representation based on drawing
1954419 physically as well as conceptually the distinction between sound in space and sound signals in circuits fell away as acousticians and sound engineers sought ever greater degrees of control
1954420 the process isnt so much recording what isnt there yet but helping it come to life
1954421 a developer has to make a presentation to the bank to show how important and substantial the development is going to be it has to be a glossier rendering showing how tall its going to be and the views its going to get
1954422 the challenge is how to capture what we see through time
1954423 what i really sincerely try to do is have the viewer sense what the building might feel like rather what it looks like mr
1954424 there are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds
1954425 now i rejoice in what was suffered for you and i fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to christs afflictions for the sake of his body which is the church i have become its servant by the commission god gave me to present to you the word of god in its fullness the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations but is now disclosed to the saints to them god has chosen to make known among the gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory
1954426 though i am the least deserving of all gods people he graciously gave me the privilege of telling the gentiles about the endless treasures available to them in christ i was chosen to explain to everyone this mysterious plan that god the creator of all things had kept secret from the beginning
1954427 i want them to be encouraged and knit together by strong ties of love i want them to have complete confidence that they understand gods
1954428 looking back then i would have arranged for myself to be taught survival techniques for both natural and urban wilderness i would want to have been instructed in self hypnosis aikido in elementary medicine sexual hygiene vegetable gardening in astronomy navigation and sailing in cookery and clothesmaking in metalwork and carpentry in drawing and painting in printing and typography in botany and biology in optics and acoustics in semantics and psychology in mysticism and yoga in electronics and mathematical fantasy in drama and dancing in singing and in playing an instrument by ear in wandering and advanced daydreaming in prestidigitation in techniques of escape from bondage in disguise in conversation with birds and beasts in ventriloquism in french and german conversation in planetary history in morphology and in classical chinese

1954433 so far it sounds to me like visibility was not an issue it was not windy up on that ridge top
1954434 we will work to recover that recorder but we cant guarantee its condition because of the extensive fire damage and that may unfortunately limit its usefulness
1954435 there were bodies thrown on him and i think that protected him
1954436 when a firefighter dies everyone knows him because we are all from the same cut
1954437 it affected everybody emotionally but everybody accepted the challenge and went back to what we do everyday

1954453 was developed to help network professionals select cabling capable of supporting poe plus with minimized risk of degraded performance due to elevated temperature
1954454 ieee 802 3at poe plus operating efficiency how to keep a hot application running cool
1954455 good heat dissipation performance exhibited by the cabling plant is especially critical since no methods exist today for monitoring temperature rise in an installation or mitigating a high temperature environment historically a comfortable level of performance margin is considered to be 50 per cent headroom to standards specified limits this would be equivalent to 6 db headroom for a transmission performance parameter following these guidelines the solutions that offer the most desirable levels of heat dissipation headroom in support of the poe plus application are category 6a f utp and category 7a s ftp cabling systems

1954457 royalti dari batubara tidak bisa disamakan dengan restitusi ppn pajak pertambahan nilai
1954458 namun jika dibawa hingga ke tingkat itu saya kira pemerintah indonesia masih berada di posisi yang kuat
1954459 kalau antar korporasi barangkali perjumpaan itu dimungkinkan tetapi negara kan bukan company maka harus berada dalam koridor hukum yang ada koridor hukum untuk royalti sebagai penerimaan negara bukan pajak pnbp berbeda dengan pajak
1954460 now after john was arrested jesus came into galilee proclaiming the gospel of god and saying
1954461 a sower went out to sow and as he sowed some seeds fell along the path and the birds came and devoured them other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil and immediately they sprang up since they had no depth of soil but when the sun rose they were scorched and since they had no root they withered away other seeds fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked them other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain some a hundredfold some sixty some thirty he who has ears let him hear
1954462 to you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven but to them it has not been given
1954463 hear then the parable of the sower when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart this is what was sown along the path as for what was sown on rocky ground this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy yet he has no root in himself but endures for a while and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word immediately he falls away as for what was sown among thorns this is the one who hears the word but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and it proves unfruitful as for what was sown on good soil this is the one who hears the word and understands it he indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold in another sixty and in another thirty
1954464 the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field but while his men were sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away
1954465 the kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field
1954466 the kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened
1954467 i will open my mouth in parables i will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world
1954468 explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field
1954469 the one who sows the good seed is the son of man
1954470 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which a man found and covered up then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
1954471 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls who on finding one pearl of great value went and sold all that he had and bought it
1954472 again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind
1954473 therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old
1954474 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
1954475 i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are

1954508 its a bad outcome but were not terribly surprised by it
1954509 this is a cruel blow for women and their families phamacs continuing refusal to fund the treatments new zealanders need is simply inhumane
1954510 this adds huge stress and suffering for women when they most need support and comfort i am amazed government hasnt stepped in to end this inhumane treatment of our women
1954511 increased funding for medicines including herceptin will surely become an election issue that will give voters the opportunity to decide
1954512 i want to be absolutely clear this decision is not about the cost of herceptin this decision rests solely on the science and our assessment our confidence around whether or not funding 12 months treatment with herceptin would produce additional health benefits
1954513 its not about who can scream the loudest and make the most noise
1954514 the sheer weight of evidence supporting 12 months is overwhelming
1954515 its totally incomprehensible that the governments drug buying agency is persisting with this sub optimal and unproven nine week course
1954516 women with breast cancer need certainty and reassurance that they will have access to the international standard of care that will give them the best chance of beating this disease

1954522 i have never understood why white women were placed in bee in the first place because white women were not disenfranchised by apartheid they may have had tough times bt they are not previously disadvantaged
1954523 surely affirmative action was meant to provide additional opportunity for the previously disadvantaged even though white women were not totally disadvantaged they had limited opportunities thefore more opportunities should be opened to them
1954524 in these cases one of the twins is always stronger than the other and in this case barsha was not the strong one and has died

1954530 when i took the picture im sure there was no one there
1954531 it was only when i downloaded it on my camera that i saw it
1954532 i showed it to my friends and family but no one can explain it
1954533 it was tall and lanky and it was walking towards our way
1954534 i thought i was seeing things so i didnt say anything
1954535 i looked over to my mom and she was rubbing her eyes
1954536 i know it wasnt an animal cause it was upright it was human like like the way we walk
1954537 the intention of the hatchers of this heinous plot was to sacrifice not too few honourable members as eternal ransom to an ousted legislative leadership that had expired in morals virtues and value

1954540 any time is a perfect time to bring to life a hero and the spirit is a very good hero
1954541 he is an urban zorro and in a time when were getting very very focused on the gadget and doohickeys and vehicles of the superheroes its great to have a guy with just a hat and a tie and a mask and a pair of fists making the city right
1954542 i did a lot of research i talked to everybody before we put frank in this job i talked to producer elizabeth avellan and director robert rodriguez about what their experience was with him on sin city i mean look we all knew frank was going to be a great visual storyteller hes proven that he drew those things for years that kind of look like storyboards also his style is so strong hes so stylistic but could he work with actors those sorts of things
1954543 my dads a film editor i grew up knowing how to edit so it was a good marriage because there were technical things frank didnt know but hes so talented hes one of the strongest voices and visions of any director that ive ever worked with and all i did was be able to give him some of the technical tools he didnt have we really did work closely together and we had a great time and it was always his vision and we were able to always get his vision up on the screen
1954544 its a completely different day to day experience because when i write and draw i am alone in my studio
1954545 when i am on a movie set im collaborating with hundreds of people and working with the actors is completely different than drawing a bunch of people i made up
1954546 for me you know frank is egoless kind of open to suggestion he likes to laugh a lot and the more outrageous you could be to make this thing happen the more he was accepting of it
1954547 but i am sure nick fury being a guy with an attitude that hes always had will be an interesting character to play when the movie finally has him fleshed out and doing something other than just talking to iron man
1954548 its like ever since i first discovered that they changed nick furys image to being essentially me ive been waiting and going so when do i actually get to do it
1954549 ive been a huge comic fan my whole life ive been coming to comic con for fourteen years
1954550 i thought oh my god i am here i made this happen we have this movie and my dream came true how many times do you get a dream come true in your lifetime you cant be in a better place you cant be in a better time for having made this movie and i couldnt work with better people than frank miller i mean frank miller and will eisner i waited a long time but then i got to do it exactly right so its unbelievably thrilling for me

1954585 they told us not to pay for any more air tickets and let them know if any new cases come up
1954586 it is a step in the right direction because it is becoming too expensive for us to buy tickets for these people
1954587 it is a fact that more are running away and we have noticed that

1954645 but i found out after serving christ for a few months that conversion was only like enlisting in the army that there was a battle on hand and that if i was to get a crown i had to work for it and fight for it
1954646 salvation is a gift as free as the air we breathe but on the other hand if we are to gain a crown we must work for it
1954647 the world the flesh and the devil are too much for any man but if we are linked to christ by faith and he has formed in us the hope of glory then we shall get the victory over every enemy it is believers who are the overcomers thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ 2 corinthians 2 14 through him we shall be more than conquerors
1954648 we want to keep in mind that if we are going to overcome the world we have got to work with god it is his power that makes all the means of grace effectual
1954649 every man i dont care who he is that doesnt have christ in him is a failure
1954650 if i have god for me i am going to overcome
1954651 to fear is to have more faith in your antagonist than in christ
1954652 many men want a religion in which there is no cross but they cannot enter heaven that way if we are to be disciples of jesus christ we must deny ourselves and take up our cross and follow him
1954653 yet if i had ten thousand lives jesus christ would have every one of them
1954654 we want a christianity that goes into our homes and everyday lives some mens religion just repels me they put on a whining voice and a sort of a religious tone and talk so sanctimoniously on sunday that you would think they were wonderful saints but on monday they are quite different they put their religion away with their clothes and you dont see any more of it until the next sunday you laugh but let us look out that we dont belong to that class

1954700 james dean was spectacularly talented handsome in a fragile sort of way and absolutely outrageous he was an original impish compelling magnetic utterly winning one moment obnoxious the next definitely gifted
1954701 in front of the camera he had an instinct that was nearly uncanny i dont recall ever working with anyone who had such a gift i recall one scene where he was in a shadow and had to lift his head to the light we explained how it should go and he played it exactly right to the half inch the first time he just seemed to know how it should be without rehearsal or anything
1954702 we may do that unless we get wind from another team that something is up
1954703 you put reggie into this mix and we go concrete
1954704 o k guys give larry the damn ball and get the hell out of his way
1954705 its tough when youre sitting 43 minutes for me to be effective ive got to be on the floor
1954706 not much i can do right now just keep fighting keep getting ready to be involved hopefully it comes soon
1954707 were working at it hopefully moving the ball forward a little bit each day i dont usually like to talk about contract negotiations in any type of detail unless the player wants to or does so first in this case i think we have a better chance of getting a deal done in relative secrecy or confidentiality i just answer it in general terms and say were working at it and making progress
1954708 wed be crazy to deplete that depth just for the sake of making a deal
1954709 as is the case every offseason well explore our options unless theres a significant return i dont foresee a trade in that area that said there may be teams out there willing to give a significant return given the quality of players were talking about and the market
1954710 were probably out of the free agent market unless theres a real value there as far as the trade market is concerned if we have a chance to add a real good young controllable pitcher sure but were pretty happy with our depth right now what we needed was quality to protect the remainder of the rotation
1954711 only 5 games and those team arent as good as we think
1954712 only 5 games and those team arent as good as we think
1954713 with alex its not about the money as people are making it out to be he wants to win and he feels that boston has the best chance of winning not just next season but for seasons to come
1954714 i personally believe the players preference is to stay in boston first and foremost
1954715 were not good enough as of nov 7 2007 to say that anyone is untouchable
1954716 obviously there are players that were much less likely to talk about and it would be much harder for us to deal that being said we have to listen to anything and everything and if there is a team that wants player x and is offering in our opinion a good deal more than player x we cant be afraid to pull the trigger
1954717 nothing yet but were trying mike loves being a red sox and were trying to make it happen
1954718 were probably out of the free agent market unless theres a real value there
1954719 as far as the trade market is concerned if we have a chance to add a real good young controllable pitcher sure but were pretty happy with our depth right now what we needed was quality to protect the remainder of the rotation
1954720 was ready to make a boston specific rodriguez presentation to the sox brass complete with charts and graphs on the revenue streams associated with the third baseman
1954721 i think theres a realization in baseball that if you try to keep things the same it will change on you anyway
1954722 players age and players change chemistry changes payroll structures change better to be proactive and try to find the right mix for now and in the future rather than let it happen to you
1954723 some days i would wake up and it would be hard to grip a bat
1954724 i changed my grip a little bit on the bat and went from there it was just one of those things you know you have to take care of after the season but you have to play through a lot of guys have done that you definitely dont want to shut it down and have surgery during the whole thing we just had to find a way to fight through it
1954725 well we thought all a long the a rod still can comeback to the yankees
1954726 if you like joe montana youll like matt ryan hes very smooth very sharp and very calm hes a leader
1954727 were not just a good team were a great team and dont you f forget that and lets go play one at a time and go prove that because let me tell you something
1954728 theres a reason why you wear this red sox uniform
1954729 in both cases we mutally agreed to revisit our discussions this summer
1954730 delonte and robert are players that we value we look forward to continuing our talks with them this season and in the future
1954731 i have to stay positive make the most of when i get a chance to go at it and just try to encourage this team it would really help to have a good start
1954732 its not my decision its the coachs decision i just have to come and stay positive and encourage and thats what i am going to do
1954733 i really like shannon at this point we havent used him a whole lot we felt it was the right decision for now and its something we can address at the end of the year
1954734 were going to work him at second team halfback and we could work him in some plays at wide receiver
1954735 he decided that no one knew what the prognosis would be with sammy and that in case it turned out to be a long term thing he wanted to be prepared for the patriots call
1954736 when sammy morris went down the phone calls from his teammates intensified
1954737 i think he felt a real twinge towards his teammates weve had calls all season from teams and the only team he would even consider coming back for was the patriots
1954738 it would be just for this season just to assist his teammates in a time of need
1954739 for a variety of reasons its not been a good fit for shannon
1954740 he hasnt gotten much of an opportunity hes a young guy who has to play
1954741 im sure well touch base with him here just general touching base with him right now were focussed on our own guys were trying to survey the landscape were trying to see if you we can sign our own guys see if anything makes sense and move on from there
1954742 any discussions as to the contract terms is between the teams and ourselves
1954743 its clear for all of us that were at the point now where weve got to do a lot of work with the teams involved and were going to keep the information and dialogue with the clubs private and confidential as we go forward
1954744 like i said right now were focussed on trying to sign mike lowell
1954745 last year we knew we were in pretty good shape because we had gabbard buchholz coming up kyle snyder and those guys all wound up coming up
1954746 not necessarily we have a lot of talent there it does seem like when ever you make a move from a potential surplus position something always goes wrong and then you have a scarcity in that one area so we wont deal away talent even if it looks like we have a potential surplus without very strong return
1954747 well see ship craig shipley and the scouts have done a great job and have a good feel for whats available
1954748 weve had the gathering information at the gms meetings and then laying the foundation for a future deal its better to understand the big picture of the off season and then follow through at the gm meetings or in the coming weeks if the right move was there we wouldnt hesitate
1954749 this ownership group has put together something special here and their commitment to players and players families is a pretty big thing
1954750 there is no other place in baseball where you can have as great of an impact on a franchise as great an impact on a region as great an impact on baseball history as you can in boston it is hard to describe what the red sox mean to new england
1954751 we are so close to the goal that has eluded us for 86 years
1954752 weve prepared the kids that we may be moving again
1954753 gm theo epstein and i have spoken multiple times daily over the past week and given the current situation i am feeling very confident that we will be able to finalize a 1 year contract to allow us a chance to finish our career as members of the red sox organization
1954754 gathered momentum and if they continued to progress like they did yesterday something could potentially get done
1954755 im beyond being irritated i was irritated the first year when i signed him i was really irritated last year im beyond irritated i dont have time to be irritated
1954756 and i told kobe that i told him that i would try my best to accommodate his wishes but that i could not afford to let him go unless we got comparable value if there is such a thing we certainly have to have all star talent
1954757 he didnt show you very much hed challenge you to find him then when youd found him hed still make you guess
1954758 i dont think we take too much pleasure being ranked no 4 no 2 or no 1 yet
1954759 because we know with one loss were back at no
1954760 well i am a free agent next year so you never know
1954761 i the damon stoudimire thing is a possibiltiy by openning night
1954762 grow up mophacy you are only funny in your own mind
1954763 they cant make any more moves they are locked in now
1954764 im obsessed i dont think theres anything wrong with it im hoping to keep his memory going its a tribute
1954765 i think it is better for the team to move on without me
1954766 hes focusing on spending time with his family ive told people dont wait on him that doesnt mean he doesnt reserve the right to change his mind in january or february
1954767 im not going to say he wont play but its not something hes really thinking about now
1954768 if p j decided to play he would probably decide to play for a team that would be a championship contender and the celtics certainly fall into that category but he has not put his mind into that thought process
1954769 we like chris but if its obvious hes not going to be part of an eight or nine man rotation then its going to be important for him to play
1954770 im going to have one cut thats not going to be as clear as youd like it
1954771 its kind of a preference or maybe something you see or maybe its a position that you need more than another a whole bunch of stuff may go into that final cut
1954772 when i worked with him on tv i found him to be an intelligent young actor who seemed to live only for his work
1954773 basically guys have less than two weeks to continue to impress me from their standpoint playing and understanding what were trying to do
1954774 like i tell all of them just keep making the decision tough for me
1954775 i have a couple of things in mind but i cant be thinking about that right now
1954776 im just trying to do the best i can and hoping to stay here if not ill decide when that time comes
1954777 i liken it to a kind of star or comet that fell through the sky and everybody still talks about it
1954778 we have some other stuff that were probably going to do inside this deal
1954779 its a deal that im not sure all the players are going to report here
1954780 weve got to make sure all the players are healthy weve got some other stuff that were probably going to do inside this deal theres a lot of business going on well see what happens
1954781 well take it a day at a time and see how it goes hes a great player he plays hard everywhere theres no sense jumping to conclusions
1954782 the trouble is depending on him because not long after every 5 for 8 a 3 for 14 is always lurking and will inevitably come
1954783 the celtics couldnt do that because he was too important to the general cause
1954784 he just always thought he was the instrument to get it done
1954785 one of the most intriguing players that ever came through here
1954786 handled himself beautifully and with a great deal of maturity
1954787 but he has intangibles i really like he was a leader on the team that made the eastern conference finals he was passionate i wouldnt mind having him on my team
1954788 it had been a week since i had been on the mound so i felt a little rusty at first but i came out of it healthy and my arm feels pretty good even though i probably hadnt thrown that many pitches in about a month it was just good to get some work in
1954789 tripleot toine is a good passer but even in his prime
1954790 at the end of the end we pulled together and made plays it was something else probably the best win ive ever been around
1954791 i was the safety on the play on the opposite side where it was supposed to be kicked
1954792 there was a lot of fighting for the ball at the bottom of the pile
1954793 offensive coordinator steve logan said to me we will overcome this
1954794 steve logan did an outstanding job at the end with the play selection and putting those kids in a place to be successful
1954795 hes a great one on one player hes a game breaker hes the difference sometimes when he wants to go he can really go just watch him and enjoy it
1954796 when youve got a 6 foot 9 270 pound guy running around and letting it be known that this is his building people will listen
1954797 i dont think i have to look at this game any differently than any other game
1954798 go out and do what ive been doing hopefully ill be here tomorrow
1954799 its not going to be all right for him in minnesota i think he needs to be somewhere he has a chance to win
1954800 what i remember most about him was the little boy quality shining forth at you from behind those thick glasses of his tearing at your heart he had that extreme and touching idealism of youth which made you wish that he would never have to be disillusioned now he wont be
1954801 its so hard to make deals that when you end up making one youre kind of surprised
1954802 its a good situation for me coming to a young team that needs some veteran leadership from a guy whos been around
1954803 34 thug are the celtics and danny ainge lobbying to be on this list
1954804 it wasnt so much a matter of whom i was acting with it was whom i was watching marlon brando maureen stapleton geraldine page jimmy dean a pretty hotshot group
1954805 it looks like weve come to an agreement with juwan in buying him out
1954806 these are our 15 were as settled as weve been
1954807 a lot of that was between ownership and where howard thought he was at in his career going through four weeks of guys together seeing what guys can do and playing different positions i think it made sense for both parties
1954808 i was looking forward to it me and juwan grew up as kids together he was in high school when i was in elementary school he was a big star in chicago i know hes thinking of trying to play for a championship so hopefully best of luck to him
1954809 that is going to be tough that will be real tough for me
1954810 if thats the case then i dont know i definitely didnt come here not to play at all hopefully we can work something out
1954811 the word was walker wanted to re join the celtics and good friend kevin garnett walker trained with kevin this summer in las vegas at impact basketball and landing in boston would have lowered the expectations
1954812 i just got here i want to see if it can work i want to play basketball everywhere i go i try to make a home for myself and play to the best of my ability and hopefully i can be a part of this team i dont know what role that will be yet but hopefully a good one
1954813 thats been proven time and time again in this league
1954814 this is my first choice i want a one year deal and it will be a deal that works for the team and myself
1954815 if its other than boston then the dollars will be a significant factor along with the teams ability to contend or field an incredibly talented blend of young players that are on the cusp of being very good
1954816 he provided a few ounces of truth on a number of occasions to a few different moderators celticsblog realgm
1954817 guys this blog was created for cthug to post his
1954818 well now then there its time to scratch my head and do my best james dean
1954819 ak 47 with that news and the trade that went down between philly and denver yesterday could the trade winds blow a center or point guard into the garden ct do you believe trades are done for now or
1954820 i hope its my last stop but i think the celtics are a great organization a legendary organization but im happy where i am
1954821 theyre taking a look at us and were looking at them
1954822 but youre always concerned about injuries or whatever can happen
1954823 i still think you can approach the game the way i approached it
1954824 if you can take the body you take the body you can still hit in this league from the top player to the fourth liner you have to take the body take a hit to make a play everyone has to be accountable on the ice
1954825 but i am ready for this challenge ready to help peter and the staff and charlie get this franchise back to where we want it
1954826 doc rivers and danny ainge really pursued him and made him feel wanted
1954827 i think hes a great fit for that organization what he wants and needs is an opportunity and i think they can provide him with that
1954828 this time its not the hope of developing young players and making the playoffs its the hope of putting up a banner
1954829 he was very afraid of being hurt he was afraid of opening up in case it was turned around and used against him
1954830 the celtics team stats landed here a little before 8 a m yesterday after a nonstop charter flight from boston most hadnt really had much sleep when they took to a court on the outskirts of town during the afternoon and went at it for two hours hard the energetic tone is basically par for the course too when kevin garnett is involved he sweated all over the palafonte adding a vocal presence to the proceedings
1954831 the celtics team stats are not proceeding cautiously with tony allen at least not for now he didnt miss a beat yesterday during his first full scale workout with the club since left acl surgery coach doc rivers said it was nothing worthy of note for allen but the guard said this was indeed the heaviest work he has done since he last played in real games
1954832 with gabe being out it just shows how thin we are at that position
1954833 offensively we didnt help each other out that is one of those days where we are only going to be better because our second team played pretty well and our third team beat us we cant just come in thinking were going to win
1954834 they made a great presentation weve got some very intelligent rookies its just our team motto this year its what were living by ubuntu we stick together thats basically what i think it means just bringing everyone together everybody sticking together through thick and thin i think it brings team unity its very unique i think if we live by it well be all right
1954835 theyd better do it right now because he may be worth a whole lot more if they wait until after the season
1954836 well have a discussion internally and with mike higgins allens representative
1954837 ill have some conversations with mike and well see where we are
1954838 ill say it this way its a dream come true for me to be playing with the celtics since ive been drafted here
1954839 im fortunate to be in this situation and im taking full advantage of it now i just need to get healthy my work ethic is there im hard nosed i think i had the best doctors working on me and the best people working with me now every day the overall situation with me should just take care of itself
1954840 i dont know nothing about none of that all i know is ta needs to get healthy thats all i know
1954841 there is debate about a whether hes going to fit in the nba
1954842 i still think his game is more suited for the nba
1954843 he would be bothered when someone would say he was mean and disrespectful because actually he wasnt they took silence to mean he cared little or nothing for them they didnt have the insight or didnt care to exercise the insight in knowing that he was a shy boy that just didnt know how to approach them instead of making an attempt to approach him they just well they just wrote him off

1954854 oknum oknum apa lha wong yang sering mengakali aturan uupa justru dari pihak pemer intah sendiri
1954855 itulah masalahnya uupa itu sendiri justru cenderung ditinggalkan sekarang pemerintah malah bikin bikin aturan aturan lain dengan keppres keppres keputusan presiden red yang belakangan mereka buat
1954856 uupa sering dikalahkan oleh keppres lihat saja kasus tanah jonggol yang keppresnya berlawanan uupa yang sebenarnya lebih kuat dasar hukumnya
1954857 selama kurun 32 tahun ini kasus tanah tidak terjadi sepuluh atau duapuluh kali bisa ratusan bahkan barangkali ribuan
1954858 dan dalam setiap kasus tersebut yang ujung ujungnya jadi kor ban ya rakyat juga
1954859 tidak benar tertun danya serah terima jabatan ini dikaitkan dengan permasalahan pertanahan yang diduga dilaku kan oleh amir machmud di tempat tugas yang lama meski hari ini dilantik dan kalau esoknya terbukti bersalah dia langsung dibebastugaskan
1954860 hukum bukan cuma dinihilkan dalam setiap kasus pertanahan bahkan pemerintah tidak akan segan segan melakukan pendekatan kekuasaan dalam setiap penanganan kasus kasus tanah
1954861 didalamnya terdapat aturan aturan terhadap uu tanah pokoknya cukup populislah
1954862 didalamnya sudah terdapat aturan batasan kepemilikan tanah dan lain sebagainya
1954863 itulah masalahnya uu yang sudah baik itu kurang didukung oleh sdm yang baik
1954864 yang salah bukan aparat pemerin tahnya yang ngawur kalau misalnya ada acuan yang jelas tidak akan ada yang namanya penyelewengan
1954865 nggak bisa dong kita selalu menganggap orang kita bodoh bodoh masyarakat kita sudah pintar pintar kok
1954866 yang mendesak uu agraria ini perlu menjadi paket reformasi karena konsentrasi kepemilikan tanah kini ada pada kelompok tertentu baik kelompok jimbaran maupun kelompok penguasa
1954867 seharusnya menteri pertanahan tidak sangkut paut dengan penggunaan tanah sedangkan pemda dengan perencanaan kotanya hanya berkonsen trasi pada tata guna tanah
1954868 bahkan semasa pemerintahan presiden soeharto kalau mau melakukan survai tentang siapa pemilik tanah harus ada izin dari sekneg saya tidak tahu dari mana aturannya bahkan banyak pemilik lahan yang mengatasnamakan orang lain
1954869 hukum bermaksud atau menganggap bahwa seseorang mengetahui apa yang dilakukan oleh orang lain dalam satu lingkungan

1954922 lenard brown and a few other of the inmates attacked you
1954923 we feared for the worst and brought you here you miraculously havent broken many bones but you had a bad concussion you also have over 100 bruises on your body and and a few sprains if we took away the morphine you would be in agony
1954924 ive never been in a fight before thats what he was looking for the handcuffs
1954925 whats going to happen to lenard there isnt much more they can do to him hes already serving two life sentences
1954926 wha oh yeah i guess i might have said something about his mother just in passing
1954927 did it ever occur to you that maybe lenard was not someone to cross given his record
1954928 you wouldnt understand you lose your mind in that place you become like a robot or something no rights no life no nothin you do anything to break the cycle and im innocent
1954929 yes yes of course tom youll be glad to hear that new evidence has emerged in your case my brother the judge may aquit you i for one do not beleive that you killed her the evidence may prove that you were not involved
1954930 lenard however may not be so lucky the state has just leagalized the death penalty his trial for assulting the gaurd is currently going on
1954931 good he deserves it after what he did to those kids he shouldve been killed after that
1954932 yes quite now once youve healed up i will be back to give you your exit exam
1954933 exit exam i have to take a test to get aquited
1954934 yes it is quite simple i assure you its partially a physical test i determine if your fit enough to leave here the other part of the test is for me to determine if you are psycologically fit enough to leave here by the way my name is dr robert rosenbaum
1954935 what are you going to do once you are released
1954936 ill visit sharons grave pray for her then ill hire a private investigator to try and find clues leading to her killer then he can do his time
1954937 how do you feel about being wrongfully judged as a killer
1954938 im not sure in the interogation room they questioned me for hours on end without food or water or sleep they told me they had witnesses saying id done it that they had fingerprints and all sorts of evidence i knew they were lying to get a confession but part of me wanted to say i did it and be done with it and i wondered if saying i did it somehow made it true does that sound strange anyway i stuck with my story and in the end i still got sent to jail for a crime i didnt commit so i feel betrayed by the justice system i guess
1954939 do you have any idea who might have done it any feelings any ideas to point the police in the right direction
1954940 he took her engagement ring it was a yellow diamond my mother left it to me its been in my family for over a century
1954941 no one cared what i had to say they all wanted to beleive i was guilty police were sure id invented the ring
1954942 tom im going to give you a sedative it will put you to sleep when you wake up you will be free to go i want you to know that you passed the exit exam your free to go as of tommorro youre probably anxious so ill put you asleep until then

1954945 jesus is instructed to watch israels house and not leave the place while the master goes away on a tour to collect clothes to be dyed but no sooner has israel left the house than jesus runs out with the boys
1954946 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that he would go on playing the game on water over the sea waves
1954947 he jesus would take the boys to the seashore and carrying the playing ball and the club he would go over the waves of the sea as though he was playing on a frozen surface hitting the playing ball and watching him the boys would scream and say watch the child jesus what he does over the waves of the sea many would gather there and watching him would be amazed
1954948 ive foten thought that if jesus had played a sport it would have been cricket

1954952 they asked a bronx judge thursday to dismiss a christian legal groups argument that the governor is overstepping his authority the case comes as thousands of gay new york couples are expected to take advantage of a new massachusetts law letting them wed there
1954953 this case is really just the alliance defense fund piling on one more nuisance case when the issues already been effectively passed over
1954954 mcinerney who has been held in the countys juvenile hall since his arrest wore inmates clothing of a white t shirt and dark pants when he appeared in the ventura courtroom when superior court judge edward brodie asked mcinerney if he understood his rights the boy answered yes sir in a strong voice the teenagers divorced parents kendra mcinerney and william mcinerney sat in front of the courtroom during the brief proceeding his mother visibly upset as she watched her son inside the prisoners holding area hurried out of the courtroom the boys father followed both declined comment
1954955 if the case were moved to juvenile court quest said he would plead to whatever charge the district attorney wants the maximum sentence allowed in that court would be confinement in a state youth facility until age 25 prosecutors say youths who commit homicides are typically paroled after seven years but quest said that is unlikely in this case if the case stays in adult court mcinerneys only hope is reducing the charge to manslaughter quest said that is the only way brandon does not die in prison he said
1954956 he went into a classroom in front of other students and shot my son in the back of the head twice my son his dead for his age to be taken into consideration he didnt take my sons age into consideration
1954957 to whom it may concern let my record speak for me i am not homophobic i am not a gay basher i did not say anything that was negative nor derogatory nor disrespectful nor malicious and i would never do a commercial if i thought it was offensive to anyone bill speedwalking is an olympic sport and thats the way speedwalkers walk and the phrase get some nuts refers to snickers candy bar having more peanuts in the movie rocky iii i call rocky balboa a disgrace to boxing because he wouldnt fight a real man there was no problem nor no complaints march 31 19896 the first wrestlemania i called this wrestler roddy roddy piper a disgrace to wrestling because he was a dirty wrestler no problem no complaints on the a team i called the bad guys a disgrace because they was harassin helpless people no problems no complaints i have been pityin fools for 28 years bill and it was never personal why didnt somebody talk to the actor who played speedwalker he will tell you about my character

1954960 people are tired of big corporations lobbyist and special interests who they feel prosper at their expense
1954961 people must understand that john mccain is not only thinking of their future but their childrens futures as well
1954962 i would answer back hard what do you mean hes not one of us its john mccain who wears 500 shoes has six houses and comes from one of the richest families in his state
1954963 its barack obama who climbed up the hard way and thats why he wants middle class tax cuts and better schools for our kids
1954964 moveons opposition to drilling is 100 percent wrong and so is john culbersons opposition to investment in renewable energy

1954978 we have prepared for the beijing olympics for seven years and now we are ready we are very confident indeed that we will stage a successful olympics
1954979 of course we hope that these will be a great games even the greatest
1954980 this day is very meaningful for us because finally the olympics are here
1954981 im here to represent my country to the fullest and im here to be an ambassador for my country
1954982 i need to send the message as an athlete from sudan im worried about the kids who are dying in darfur
1954983 im here to inspire other kids who are out there watching these olympics as i was watching the sydney olympics
1954984 me coming here im here to compete for my country the olympics are supposed to bring people together to peacefully blend and im looking forward to that and stepping on the track and wearing my colors and representing my country
1954985 hes supposed to be here hes an olympian its supposed to tell people about the situation that happened
1954986 chinese people have been great putting all these things together its great being here
1954987 we hope that these beijing olympic games can enhance friendship between different countries and regions and enhance friendship between athletes
1954988 im very honored to be here and im very honored to lead the u s team into the stadium tonight im very excited
1954989 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1954990 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1954991 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
1954992 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
1954993 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
1954994 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
1954995 i think years ago arts and culture were seen as a diplomatic thing a good thin for mayors to do there were proclamations to be signed parades were run but as a city grows up and recognizes these cultural amenities there just much much more to be done
1954996 we took the time we did the research and we looked at what other cities were doing and we sort of stopped and said hey maybe the old office wasnt doing exactly what it needs to be doing
1954997 having an office and a leader within city government does help focus policy attention on key issues
1954998 not just for the arts sector but for the city as a whole such as arts education in the public schools or access to the arts for under served communities or ensuring that theres attention to the arts paid in the neighborhoods
1954999 our former home in the gilbert building was demolished and over the past year we were moved to two interim spaces
1955000 one that had no heat over the wintertime and one next to this which is now our permanent home
1955001 its definitely taken a toll to have to learn everything about real estate development and then at the same time to be able to continue to serve the artists and youth in our communities
1955002 i definitely think that one of the hopes is that a new office of arts and culture will allow there to be a sort of liaison function in the city to help organizations facing crises or situations like ours
1955003 as much as there is this complex turbulent enthusiasm in the field for what comes next
1955004 the authority of this new office will be the true big tent incorporation of all of that as soon as there are real walls built the tenor of the voice will change

1955024 family oriented services are garnering a huge interest in the wireless industry today as carriers are looking to tap the capacity of this potential gold mine
1955025 theres not an incredible lot of growth left in the teen market 13 to 17 year olds because the overall wireless market in the u s has been slowing down during the past few years
1955026 so there has been a lot of focus on targeting teens through the family plans that carriers offer verizon and at amp t in particular have very strong market share with their family plans its basically a bucket of minutes that can be shared across all of the members of your family for an add on cost of 10 for each line it has been an incredibly successful way to target the teen market so much so that 85 percent of teens are on family plans
1955027 what becomes a bit more of a struggle with the tween market is that obviously the tweens arent going to buy the cell phones themselves the decision making process is virtually 100 percent in their parents hands so its a matter of do parents think their child needs a cell phone
1955028 the other question beyond that is parents have a fear of overage charges and ask if i get my child a cell phone is my cell phone bill going to be 500 a month

1955051 our heart goes out to the two tigers who had to endure the long trip to iraq and a dangerous future at the baghdad zoo
1955052 these tigers will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive in an area where many people live in fear and are still without access to basic necessities
1955053 we have the utmost concern for the well being of the tigers
1955054 we have full confidence that the baghdad zoo has the staff and facilities to care for them long into the future

1955056 we dont like making anything that is normal or expected of us
1955057 i started q games about seven years ago because i wanted to try and make games in my own style and i found i couldnt do that while i was working at a publisher
1955058 the reason being is that i dont pay much attention to what the consumer wants i am a bit selfish and simply make the games that i find cool and that i want to make and this quite often doesnt gel well with mass market publishing
1955059 such hateful and discriminatory rhetoric is both insulting and callous and shows a level of insensitivity and ignorance which has seldom been encountered by this board of supervisors
1955060 cardinal levada is a decidedly unqualified representative of his former home city and of the people of san francisco and the values they hold dear
1955061 the congregation of the doctrine of the faith provoked this debate indeed may have invited entanglement
1955062 it is merely the exercise of free speech rights by duly elected office holders
1955063 sadly the ruling itself clearly exhibited hostility toward the catholic church
1955064 the judge in her written decision held that the church provoked the debate by publicly expressing its moral teaching and that by passing the resolution the city responded responsibly to all of the terrible things the church was saying
1955065 our constitution plainly forbids hostility toward any religion including the catholic faith
1955066 in total disregard for the constitution homosexual activists in positions of authority in san francisco have abused their authority as government officials and misused the instruments of the government to attack the catholic church their egregious abuse of power has now the backing of a lower court unfortunately all too often we see a double standard being applied in establishment clause cases

1955160 sounds the death knell for religious freedom in public schools
1955161 by transmuting private religious speech into government speech granting school officials carte blanche authority to determine what religious speech is too religious and holding that a schools desire to avoid a perceived establishment clause violation justifies viewpoint discrimination the lower courts opinion permits a blatant violation of the constitution
1955162 the schools decision to ban religious speech is nothing more than blatant viewpoint discrimination
1955163 it was about letting students tell the class about what things are important to them and the bible is important to this student

1955190 im getting more calls from my clients about the margin tax than the income tax

1955219 we hear many stories of bravery heroism kings queens and of adventurers and the rewards of their efforts many of us have heard tell of brave dragon riders and their mounts for many these tales are now only told on cold rainy windswept nights in crowded taverns and halls these stories events have long passed from the realm of any human living memory the only exception are some of the eldest of the elves and even then they are memories of days in their youngest youth days that are often eclipsed by more prominent memories of brighter days and happier times so it comes as no surprise that a tale of an adventurer like no other has slipped past so many ears in so many years an elven adventurer who spanned more than any other in history few have traveled near as far nor seen the plethora of things much less befriended so many in the wake of this adventurer no other has yet to step so deeply into the pages of history

1955279 we were very surprised to discover that flies used sensors in their brains to gauge environmental warmth large animals use peripheral neurons to monitor ambient temperature and the prevailing view has been that the situation in small animals like fruit flies was similar
1955280 we dont know the details yet but our data suggest dtrpa1 may function a bit like a fire alarm when the temperature inside the flys head gets too high dtrpa1 activates these internal sensors that somehow help the fly move toward more hospitable climes

1955282 the irish people have spoken contrary to the predictions of social and political turmoil we believe that hundreds of millions of people across europe will welcome the rejection of the lisbon treaty this vote shows the gulf that exists between the politicians and the elites of europe and the opinions of the people as in france and the netherlands the political leaders and the establishment have done everything they could to push this through and they have failed the proposals to further reduce democracy to militarize the eu and to let private business take over public services have been rejected lisbon is dead along with the eu constitution from which it came it should now be buried
1955283 the most striklng change between the eu constitution in its older and newer version is perhaps that in order to enable some governments to reassure their electorates that the changes will have no constitutional implications the idea of a new and simpler treaty containing all the provisions governing the union has now been dropped in favour of a huge series of individual amendments to two existing treaties virtual incomprehensibilty has thus replaced simplicity as the key approach to eu reform as for the changes now proposed to be made to the constitutional treaty most are presentational changes that have no practical effect they have simply been designed to enable certain heads of government to sell to their people the idea of ratification by parliamentary action rather than by referendum
1955284 i am also deeply concerned at the direction the eu is going
1955285 i also discovered some very sinister organisations none of which the mainstream media informed us about organisations such as the transatlantic economic council the transatlantic policy network amp the streit council which seeks a union between the us and europe and whose agenda is clearly a political as well as an economic union in the fall 2007 journal of that body a world bank economist said that you could not have economic integration without political integration
1955286 i personally think that a vote in a foreign country should not determine the democratic decisions taken in the british parliament
1955287 we are convinced that the reforms contained in the treaty of lisbon are necessary to make europe more democratic and more efficient
1955288 germany and france moved to isolate ireland in the european union yesterday scrambling for ways to resuscitate the lisbon treaty a day after the irish dealt the architects of the eus new regime a crushing blow

1955504 and how those ideas relate to the possibility of one of us now appearing on the moon

1955521 i think there is so much more in existence besides matter energy and time
1955522 which was published well after my own book came out
1955523 information is never destroyed more and more information is constantly being created and its not lost and energy and matter are incontrovertible so somehow there must be some survival because one being represents a huge amount of information so i can imagine that there is survival but im not sure exactly what form it takes
1955524 our universe is not random our universe is probabilistic which means that only certain outcomes are available at a certain moment and those possible outcomes are based upon patterns that exist within the underlying structures of timelessness
1955525 and how those ideas relate to the possibility of one of us now appearing on the moon
1955526 or underlying patterns in the quantum fabric these are ideas that are central to my way of visualizing reality as well for some related discussions go to rupert sheldrakes
1955527 0 1 2 3 keep counting youre heading towards infinity take a number divide it in half divide the result in half keep dividing youre heading towards infinity are each of those infinities the same or is there more than one version of infinity
1955528 but how can there be anything more than infinity the answer is there can be other completely different infinities created through initial conditions which are different from our own big bang
1955529 every direction has its opposite up down east west for us time is a direction in the 4th spatial dimension but even though the opposite direction exists our bodies never travel that way because theyre made from thermodynamic chemical processes poll ended may 18 2008
1955530 we start with a point we make another point we join those points with a line the line that passes through those points extends to infinity in either direction can we call those two directions positive infinity and negative infinity then
1955531 wow didnt think you were that old my guess was 26
1955532 dying and rising messiah appears in some jewish texts but until now everyone thought that was the impact of christianity on judaism
1955533 but for the first time we have proof that it was the other way around the concept was there before jesus
1955534 this should shake our basic view of christianity what happens in the new testament could have been adopted by jesus and his followers based on an earlier messiah story

1955542 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
1955543 well of course but thats an awfully stupid thing to say
1955544 really shows quite possibly that surveys dont capture religious views all that well religion being the sort of thing that doesnt really lend itself to multiple choice questions or is that just my religion
1955545 prohibits zoning and landmarking laws that substantially burden the religious exercise of churches or other religious assemblies
1955546 many people dont understand that a church is not just a house of worship we need the resources for activity and ministry work during the week
1955547 one benefit of using native plants is that they are perennial because they return year to year theres no need for reseeding or replanting
1955548 they have fewer insects or disease problems than some exotics they are more heat and drought resistant because they evolved in illinois so they are very well adapted to the environment they attract wildlife for food and forage for many native species and also they are attractive and colorful
1955549 establishing natural areas can reduce water consumption mowing pesticide use and labor it doesnt eliminate them all together but it can reduce them and golf course managers like to save on costs
1955550 many golf courses dont have any natural areas as roughs so we are trying to encourage them to consider incorporating them into the course landscape in order to make the course more challenging but also to improve the setting by providing a more natural look rather than a highly manicured non native setting
1955551 we also used a combination of the two grasses because in previous research done at the university of illinois it was shown that these two grasses had great promise for use in un mowed roughs
1955552 the results showed that blue grama and cody buffalo grass had the best coverage thick and beautiful and that the plots using 30 pounds of seed per acre established quicker but by the end of the study there was no difference in the coverage between the 20 and 30 pounds so the recommendation is to use 20 pounds of seed per acre because its less seed costs less and uses less labor to plant
1955553 youre obviously on a golf course so slow play is an issue as sometimes these grasses grow very tall making it difficult to find your ball and native grasses sometimes attract nuisance animals such as deer and rabbits that get in the way as well as bees flies and mosquitoes

1955673 tindakan ini jelas cuba menghidupkan semula usaha terdahulu yang dilakukan oleh beberapa kelompok dari majlis peguam bagi menubuhkan ifc dan kemudian diikuti pula oleh satu lagi usaha dari kumpulan yang menggelarkan dirinya sebagai kumpulan artikel 11
1955674 kami menegaskan bahawa majlis peguam tidak ada hak untuk memandai mandai dan cuba membahaskan hal yang berkaitan dengan undang undang islam secara terbuka
1955675 kami mendesak supaya forum ini dihentikan oleh pihak berkuasa kerana ia boleh membawa kepada kemarahan masyarakat islam yang tidak mahu undang undang islam dicabar oleh mana mana pihak
1955676 tindakan berkenaan adalah suatu usaha yang terancang yang disusun oleh pihak tertentu untuk secara berterusan mempertikaikan hak hak yang terkandung dalam perlembagaan terhadap islam
1955677 kami memberi amaran kepada majlis peguam agar menghentikan segera penganjuran forum berkenaan atau menghadapi tindakan penentangan serius umat islam di negara ini

1955719 almost always the temporal consideration revolves around the problem of good and evil and the inconsistencies that arise as this basic relationship is defined almost always turns religious beliefs into ineffectual systems of ethics
1955720 equality is not simply a human attribute but a recognition of hte creatureness of all creation
1955721 we should find what religious ideas can credibly encompass the broadest field of both our thoughts and actions we must show that religious ideas are at least not tied to any particular view of man nature or the relationsips of man and nature that is clearly in conflict with what we know

1955729 a lot of the articles in the draft went into detail about the practical filing process but they have got rid of them all
1955730 in europe you wouldnt normally look at the seller when calculating whether the threshold has been met you look at the buyer and the target if the chinese authorities intend the seller to be included a lot more transactions are likely to be caught
1955731 companies will look at this regulation and have no legal certainty whether they need to notify

1955739 because of a new and unusual threat a polar bear stuck on land due to climate change
1955740 but with recent warming the ice is miles from shore and bears are becoming increasingly trapped on land well away from their usual seal prey
1955741 the shorelines have experienced dramatic erosion because of the warming climate
1955742 to understand how such erosion was affecting the ability of millions of shorebirds attempting to gain enough food energy to fuel their southward migrations to asia south america and many other distant sites
1955743 it is ironic that our efforts to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife were disrupted by the top arctic predator displaced by climate
1955744 the uncertainty of how dangerous this or other polar bears in the region might be led to the decision to charter a bush pilot to get the crew out before a major storm made such a rescue unlikely for days
1955745 we saw the polar bear on our first clear day after several days of poor weather
1955746 but the prospect of maintaining a round the clock vigil while trying to do our surveys had us concerned
1955747 polar bears have been trapped on land in arctic alaska all spring and summer unable to swim out to sea ice and pursue seals
1955748 their condition and how dangerous they might be is unknown

1955773 we edited all the fake commercials in final cut pro and needed to export all the sequences into after effects to add in all the special effects but with 250 complex layers this is an impossible task automatic duck performed flawlessly elegantly and with amazing speed and accuracy importing 250 layers with all stacks perfectly in tact and in the right order we could not have done this without automatic duck nor would we have made it to cannes in time
1955774 another thing automatic duck provides us is the freedom to do so much of our work in final cut pro we didnt have to compromise our workflow and it enabled us to operate worry free because we knew that if we needed to export into another tool or platform for some finishing work we could with no effort no lost time and no pulling our hair out
1955775 when the trailer house edited an entire three minute trailer on the avid and we had one day to do a hi def online on final cut pro it was automatic duck pro export fcp that read in the avid timeline and gave us a flawless final cut sequence

1956105 heres the meaning coastal dwellers used to burn a light in a window to help ships navigate or to welcome someone home from the sea so if there are two lamps burning and no ship at sea it means youre a foolish person wasting your time and wasting good fuel
1956106 he played an instrumental vital part in the philadelphia rock scene
1956107 going to see this band that i had heard about called robert hazard and the heroes
1956108 and they just ripped it up they were all dressed in black with red accents it was a macho stripped down lean mean attack machine
1956109 they were playing their tight and solid new wave rock with the musicians in line behind their fearless leader and rocking the hell out of the downtown crowd
1956110 theyd move back and forth as a unit raising the energy of the crowd with each and every step it was a talented group of players and roberts songs and stage presence were not to be denied
1956111 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
1956112 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great songwriters and poet guitar players
1956113 fought this dichotomy he was known for one thing but that was really not his essence his soul he was a folky rootsy guy
1956114 the stripped down acoustic concerts i did with my buddy michael pilla i thought these were the most rewarding and the most appreciated by my audience
1956115 that nigger if he gets elected ill assassinate him myself
1956116 he would simply shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking

1956118 riuniamo le assemblee di tutti i parchi italiani per discutere del loro futuro
1956119 il documento ha spiegato pappaterra pur riflettendo e risentendo del cambio gestionale avvenuto nel 2007 anno del commissariamento e poi della nomina del presidente che ha operato senza consiglio direttivo sino a marzo 2008 con lapprovazione finale metter lente in condizione di svolgere i programmi pianificati
1956120 se ci mettiamo insieme dalle alpi alletna ha dichiarato berardone avremo pi forza e potremo spiegare realmente quali sono i compiti degli enti parco ed intervenire con determinazione nel dibattito in corso che pensa di trasformare gli organi gestori dei parchi in fondazioni o quantaltro non abbiamo pregiudizi conclude berardone nei confronti delle proposte avanzate dal ministro ma vogliamo trovare soluzioni condivise con i territori
1956121 friends like me for like 7 yrs then start to dislike me thank god im past that point w jess and nic stacy watch out 7 yr itch lol kidding
1956122 when will you keep your word on my release its been three months
1956123 i am obligated to defend the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1956124 we will not allow the unpunished killing of our fellow citizens those who are guilty will suffer the punishment they deserve
1956125 hundreds of soldiers and dozens of armored vehicles including tanks
1956126 we dont know whether they are militias or regular russian forces
1956127 as they carry heavy equipment we think they must be regulars we dont know we just know they are coming to attack us
1956128 there is a lot of information and it is very contradictory
1956129 any word said in the wrong context could be ruinous for the peaceful and human resolution of this conflict
1956130 we hiding in the basement of a house showered by bombs are not feeling now that we are citizens of a great country we hear russia has a great air force and excellent planes protect your citizens you are our last hope
1956131 the blood shed in south ossetia will remain on the conscience of these people and their entourage we will not allow anyone to do harm to our peacekeepers and citizens of the russian federation
1956132 we consider that to be an act of military aggression and we call on the russian federation to immediately stop military aggression against georgia
1956133 we are very worried that this will escalate even further
1956134 it will escalate very easily to a kind of a warfare and who controls this
1956135 now as far as the situation is now we still think it can be controlled by the parties but if it escalates who knows
1956136 the citi settlement sets a precedent not from a litigation perspective but more from a public relations perspective
1956137 however i expect that regulators are sensitive to the fact that investment banks very survival is at risk with the subprime and credit crunch so regulators may be looking at the viability of the entire industry before exacting a pound of flesh
1956138 when one major firm settles a material piece of litigation others follow suit pretty quickly
1956139 it puts pressure on other institutions to make their customers whole
1956140 they keep finding ways to attack the industry and that will drive innovation out of new york city and to london tokyo and elsewhere
1956141 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country

1956144 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
1956145 weve had these back and forths with china for years
1956146 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
1956147 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
1956148 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
1956149 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
1956150 so we have to go out there and play like were representing the us of a

1956367 we are not the least bit surprised that the bbfc finds itself embroiled in yet another row
1956368 by adopting a permissive approach to film classification over many years the most brutal violence the most obscene and profane language and the most explicit sexual conduct has effectively been normalised and glamorised evidently the bbfc is blind to the moral ethical and social havoc it wreaks and it is time for the board to be modernised so that civilised values and behaviour are reflected in its judgements
1956369 it is time for the board to be modernised so that civilised values and behaviour are reflected in its judgements

1956372 it benefits the children because they get a broader perspective on different issues when you have more students in a class its easier to break them down into work groups and theres a bigger variety of different attitudes and problem solving techniques when you have small classes and small groups within that class you can lose that
1956373 a charter school is attached or sponsored by a school district in this case lee county
1956374 the state pays an allowance per student and the rest of the money to run the school is raised by private funds public schools raise funds to go on field trips or for craft supplies we raise money to run the operation of the whole school what the state pays per child is not enough on the other hand the benefit of being a charter school is that while you have the same state standards for learning you have the ability to do it in any way you want thats why we have multi age classrooms we are allowed to develop the curriculum in a way we feel is best to serve the children we dont use the textbooks that are required in public schools this is a non text book school
1956375 we get to have our own philosophy our own way of teaching
1956376 we teach with understanding as the base of learning and once we teach a concept we move on it gives us more freedom to work with the children at their level to challenge them thats an important part of learning if they dont have any say or ownership in what they are doing then theyre just doing their lessons because the teacher said so thats what sets us aside and thats my pride in the school we dont just teach lessons we teach the child

1956432 wahai anak adam sempatkanlah untuk menyembah ku maka aku akan membuat hatimu kaya dan menutup kefakiranmu jika tidak melakukannya maka aku akan penuhi tanganmu dengan kesibukan dan aku tidak menutup kefakiranmu
1956433 barang siapa memperbanyak istighfar maka allah s w t akan menghapuskan segala kedukaannya menyelesaikan segala masalahnya dan memberinya rezeki dari arah yang tidak disangka
1956434 dan seorang lelaki akan diharamkan baginya rezeki kerana dosa yang dibuatnya
1956435 iaitu orang orang beriman dan hati mereka menjadi tenteram dengan mengingati allah ingatlah hanya dengan mengingati allah hati menjadi tenteram
1956436 siapa berbakti kepada ibu bapanya maka kebahagiaanlah buatnya dan allah akan memanjangkan umurnya
1956437 apabila hamba itu meninggalkan berdoa kepada kedua orang tuanya nescaya terputuslah rezeki allah daripadanya
1956438 tidaklah kamu diberi pertolongan dan diberi rezeki melainkan kerana orang orang lemah di kalangan kamu
1956439 siapa yang menunaikan hajat saudaranya maka allah akan menunaikan hajatnya
1956440 sesungguhnya kebajikan itu memberi cahaya kepada hati kemurahan rezeki kekuatan jasad dan disayangi oleh makhluk yang lain manakala kejahatan pula boleh menggelapkan rupa menggelapkan hati melemahkan tubuh sempit rezeki dan makhluk lain mengutuknya
1956441 barang siapa ingin dilapangkan rezekinya dan dilambatkan ajalnya maka hendaklah dia menghubungi sanak saudaranya
1956442 sentiasalah berada dalam keadaan bersih dari hadas nescaya allah akan memurahkan rezeki
1956443 hai zubair ketahuilah bahawa kunci rezeki hamba itu ditentang arasy yang dikirim oleh allah azza wajalla kepada setiap hamba sekadar nafkahnya maka siapa yang membanyakkan pemberian kepada orang lain nescaya allah membanyakkan baginya dan siapa yang menyedikitkan nescaya allah menyedikitkan baginya
1956444 wahai anak adam jangan sekali kali engkau malas mengerjakan empat rakaat pada waktu permulaan siang solat dhuha nanti pasti akan aku cukupkan keperluanmu pada petang harinya

1956446 dan kami akan memberi balasan kepada orang orang yang bersyukur
1956447 ya allah bukalah hati kami untuk mengenali mu bukalah pintu rahmat dan keampunan mu ya fattah ya alim
1956448 seandainya kamu bertawakal kepada allah dengan sebenar benar tawakal nescaya kamu diberi rezeki seperti burung diberi rezeki ia pagi hari lapar dan petang hari telah kenyang
1956449 jalan keluar dari segala perkara yang menyusahkan dan memberinya rezeki dari jalan yang tidak terlintas di hatinya
1956450 how can you be so calm as we fly through this storm arent you terrified
1956451 how can you be so calm in a situation like this
1956452 im not worried do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god gods love
1956453 i certainly dont believe that he loves me limitlessly and unconditionally i dont believe he cares for me and numbers the very hairs of my head i dont believe that when i am worrying i believe i am alone in this world and all this evil that is happening to me and i have got to know tomorrow and i have to work out my own plan
1956454 dont be anxious over food dont be anxious over shelter dont be
1956455 i wonder what the weather forecast will be in june
1956456 will we have a tornado in june will we have hail is it worth planting this seed
1956457 why me i mean it hasnt happened to anybody else
1956458 be anxious for nothing but but in everything by prayer and supplication make your requests known unto god
1956459 now stop that repent stop change your mind be anxious for nothing but turn your attention the other direction make your requests known to god
1956460 it is a deliberate turning from our supposed problems from our non existent resources to god
1956461 making your requests made known in your union with god
1956462 i will fear no evil for thou art with me
1956463 turn toward god and very specifically share with him exactly what the cause of the worry is
1956464 here father i give it to you i am helpless take this naming it specifically into your love for me i give it over to you because you love me so much it belongs to you i give it over to you right now do what ever has to be done because i dont know
1956465 when i look back on all these worries i remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life most of which had never happened
1956466 worry is like a rocking chair it gives you something to do but it doesnt get you anywhere
1956467 there is a great difference between worry and concern a worried person sees a problem and a concerned person solves a problem
1956468 there is nothing that wastes the body like worry and on who has any faith in god should be shamed to worry about anything whatsoever
1956469 worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow it only saps today of its joy
1956470 if you cant sleep then get up and do something instead of lying there worrying its the worry that gets you not the lack of sleep
1956471 worry is a thin stream of fear trickling through the mind if encouraged it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained

1956528 its a fine cold weather coat that is warm enough to drop a layer or two superbly comfortable huge pockets long arms in case you forgot gloves repairable easily re proofable
1956529 ive used my claw in both very wet and blizzard conditions ive been warm and dry in both conditions and only having a helly hansen lifa top on underneath the pit vents really make a difference to regulating your temperature the only minor fault is the location of the map pockets as they are obstructed by my pack waist belt i certainly wont be going back to a hardshell for winter
1956530 we both tried your medium claw on 2 walks in pennine hills over the last 2 weekends up to 2000 feet low cloud light to medium rain steep climbs strong winds on the tops one wearing your jacket over a thin merino layer and a power stretch top the other
1956531 the jacket was much lighter than i thought it would be when i first saw it it is really comfy as well
1956532 it was a great feature function wise especially in those conditions it stayed in place due to all of the adjustments and the peak allowed for full visibility and also helped keep my face dry it was the best feature of the jacket in fact
1956533 ive worn most waterproofs over wet clothing at some time in most cases i stay clammy and the clothing doesnt dry out much i do warm up though the best hardshell is event and wet clothing has dried through this there is no hardshell fabric i would want to wear next to the skin except for omms stuff which is soft on the inside paramo does dry quickly when wet and wet clothing dries through it in february i got soaked almost to the waist fording a river with my paramo trousers unzipped and rolled up the temperature was 15c and i crawled out onto snow this was in yellowstone and the river was fed by thermal springs which is why it wasnt frozen i was shivering violently and my legs were numb when i zipped down the wet trousers the trousers froze and were stiff with ice within ten minutes of setting off skiing my legs were warm and the trousers almost dry no hardshell fabric performs like this
1956534 i consider the jam to be unbeatable with a bulky lightweight load
1956535 in april 2007 i used the furtech claw jacket as part of an expedition to liverpool land eastern greenland
1956536 the jacket itself has many features the hood was a snug fit around the head especially when used during strong winds this can be adjusted around the back of the neck and also on the rear of the head i also liked the idea of the clear visor on the hood which gave me better visibilty of about 4cm when used i also found the fabric close to the mouth when the hood were up very soft and not abrehsive to the skin this was paramount to me as some jacket fabrics can feel harsh and irritable and thus wanting to remove the hood the jacket has 2 chest pockets which i found great as i could carry my essential items in such as suncream lipsalve chocolate bars and a change of headgear if required the hand pockets were used to carry extra gloves if needed underneath the jacket i wore one lightweight thermal and a medium weight thermal with the jacket used as the outside layer i felt comfortable at all times during activity and only had to apply a duvet jacket when coming to a standstill during extreme temperatures after ski touring or climbing up the peaks the hem of the jacket were nicely secured around my waist to prevent any unwanted chills around my midriff and also didnt interfere with the harness i was wearing over the jacket the cuffs were readily tightened around my wrist and fitted easily over my thick gloves and was adjusted easily with the black bite tabs the rain vents which are fitted near the underarm area to the jacket was used as a thermostat so that as my body increased in temperature i could open them during activity and to close them when immobile i found the jacket a godsend on this journey and would definately reccommend this item to anyone travelling during this environment i also look forward to using the jacket on many more trips

1956585 liberals have the attitude of its ok to kill unborn babies
1956586 only a complete idiot believes that liberal myth of separation of church and state
1956587 nowhere in the constitution does it even say anything about separation of church and state
1956588 in fact the first amendmant says that congress shall make no laws concerning religion and that is exactly what liberal politicians have done
1956589 and liberal judges that dont belong on the supreme court
1956590 have done why do we have different levels of judges like regular judges district judges circuit judges and supreme court judges

1956595 turn it over turn it over everything is in it
1956596 i met with people in boca grande who were concerned about preserving the integrity of charlotte harbor and the issue of height restrictions
1956597 charlotte harbor is of particular importance to residents of boca grande legally most are residents of lee county but geographically we are all residents of the charlotte harbor area and have a legitimate right to be concerned about the issues
1956598 we of course could make no promises to either percy or ruth but we are deeply grateful for and proud of the showing the island made
1956599 its clear that boca grande residents are aware of the issues that are important to the long term well being of the island and are willing to do something about it we have high hopes for their candidacies
1956600 so when we saw how some of the seated charlotte county commissioners voted on issues effecting the well being of our island we began to look for some new candidates
1956601 we came to know and appreciate several of the citizens who were standing up to support issues that would keep charlotte harbor and gasparilla island healthy
1956602 continuously lied to the media the public and the court by claiming that pollard and his wife have the use of state funds and that the state supports pollard and his wife financially
1956603 the state of israel is throwing sand in the face of the public and of the court and brazenly lying when it claims to be supporting pollard and his wife
1956604 the state has no right to deceive the public and to act as if it is doing something for pollard not only has the state abandoned pollard for 23 years it has the nerve to lie about it to the public
1956605 if you want to be called up the torah youll need a jewish name
1956606 a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
1956607 and whatever the man called each living creature that remained its name
1956608 if youd like well go together to a famous tzaddik holy man who can help you find your name
1956609 his hebrew name is hirshel he does not like his name i had him make a list
1956610 you know that big donor you were looking for hes in israel hes at the western wall right now
1956611 youre here in the u s and youre not coming to visit us in el paso
1956612 its a matter of kosher food what i am supposed to eat in el paso texas
1956613 it could be a great money making time for our local businesses
1956614 we want to make sure all the business owners are aware of whats going on so they can schedule their stores to be open

1956616 partial transits are a more affordable way to cruise the panama canal
1956617 you can do things on these ships that you just cant do on mainstream cruises
1956618 on a panama canal cruise youre really going into the heart of central america
1956619 have you ever wondered why many prefer the caribbean to other cruises
1956620 it can be a tough task to decide which part of the caribbean you wish to cruise your basic interest and aim of cruising can play a crucial role in your decision do you want to treat yourself to a lazy holiday just to lie on the deck relax and do nothing then you could choose the western caribbean cruise as the ports are located far apart the sailing time is more you get to spend more time cruising in the sea than at the ports the major ports are jamaica costa rica dominican republic and cayman islands the shore also offers scope for varied excursions into the inland you can explore the historical ruins go trekking in the forests or simply explore the land the eastern caribbean has many ports of call you get shorter duration of sailing and more of shopping dining and other entertainments on the shores you can always choose the ones that suit your interests how much will you spend it is indeed a crucial question
1956621 your blog is shit learn how to write learn correct grammar learn to organize your thoughts learn how to write a thesis statement and back it up most of all write something interesting hope your artistic abilities are better than your writing abilities or youre going to have to serve a lot of burgers to pay off those college loans
1956622 an unforeseen benefit for us has been a major increase in the safety and protection of our players we have not had major injuries to our offensive players in a game or practice due to the spread out nature of the a 11 and this is a major selling point it really helps the players of the much smaller schools stay healthier during the season which in turn allows schools like us to remain competitive throughout the entire year
1956623 hes a seed cadet from balamb garden i think he can be a great asset to our cause
1956624 bu but rinoa have you thought things through i mean we dont know this guy
1956625 yes yes glad to be of service now that we have dispensed with the formalities kindly introduce me to that beautiful young lady
1956626 miss trepe allow me the liberty of introducing myself alistair sandro dolletia at your service
1956627 your excellency its an honour to meet you in person
1956628 it seems im not the only one with such propensities
1956629 humph this dear boy here is my nieces best friend seifer almasy and as you well know ex sorceress knight
1956630 i believe you two have not been properly introduced yet your excellency may i present seifer almasy
1956631 and i see that dollet has emerged unscathed from its little
1956632 ah alistair youll have to concede he got you there
1956633 my dear tahera i concede to your superior judging skills
1956634 lets exchange partners you young rapscallion harrumph you were coming to retrieve her anyway
1956635 ill be watching with great interest how you deal with this young scamp of a knight
1956636 madame ganryu allow me to welcome you its a great pleasure to have you attend this reception
1956637 im pleased to be here president alloutte in support of such a worthy cause
1956638 please allow me to present you my aide watts electro
1956639 tahera i would like you to meet my ex seed instructor quistis trepe
1956640 oh please call me tahera i have a niece whos also a seed at balamb garden
1956641 yes fujin has told me quite a lot about you
1956642 pardon us but tahera and i have quite a lot of catching up to do
1956643 well tahera what brings you out of that jungle you trabians call grandidi city
1956644 really alistair you of all people should refrain from calling our beautiful green haven a jungle after all dollet is built on an arid piece of rock open to all sorts of incursions
1956645 ah its been too long since you and i exchanged words you broke my heart when you accepted ganryus suit over my own
1956646 humph i didnt want to leave trabia and it didnt take you long to replace me
1956647 you should know all about political alliances however poor sofia proved to be a weakling and therefore easy prey for my political opponents
1956648 what will you do if roberto ever finds out the truth about his mothers accidental death
1956649 thanks to you he will never find out you sent jomei did you not
1956650 as i was saying roberto has no reason to believe his mothers death to be anything but accidental
1956651 i thought quistis trepe would make him an excellent wife that boy is too much of a pansy to make it on his own he needs a strong skilful woman to back him up
1956652 i dont think you should set your sights on that particular young lady
1956653 harrumph im surprised that young hoodlum didnt attack me right away hes quite a formidable warrior when roused
1956654 alistair i believe that young man has grown quite a bit since his brush with the sorceress
1956655 you think he would agree to leave garden if i offer him enough incentive
1956656 if he could be swayed he would be working for me now but that is one stubborn young man
1956657 it doesnt surprise me that young thug is best friends with your niece it takes one to know one
1956658 youre such a sore loser really you should be happy that fujin refused to marry your roberto hes too sweet a boy to be married off to someone like my niece she would make mincemeat out of him
1956659 you mean he needs a wife that can double as bodyguard how many attempts were made against his life this week
1956660 that beautiful young seed would have roberto eating out of her hands in no time whatsoever but its also very evident where her interest lies i would want my robertos life to be different from mine a sense of duty will only breed an heir to the dukedom but a strong bond can create a real ducal family
1956661 well in any case even if you tried i dont think he would allow her to go to another without putting up a fierce fight
1956662 i have to concede that young rascal has a perverse sense of humour by naming that pitch black blade hyperion
1956663 oh it wasnt really him who named it it was cid kramer who gave hyperion to seifer
1956664 humph hard to believe such a weakling would such a blade in his possession
1956665 holy shit 569 unresolved disappearances what the hell is goin on
1956666 uh yeah this is my first assignment these numbers gotta be staggering even for you maam
1956667 smirk you got that right rookie an dont maam me it really pisses me off
1956668 good youre learning unless you like gettin your ass whipped
1956669 hmn cmon junior were gonna have us a little field trip
1956670 how dya think you got yourself such a cool assignment rookie were seriously understaffed aroun here
1956671 yeah better close it junior here toss dont let it slip pass your fingers it contains real sensitive information you dont wanna get scrambled just cuz you were too clumsy with yer hands cmon lets go
1956672 temple of zar thra in s 107 i gotta bunch of questions i need to ask some of the enlightened ones
1956673 awww desu what else is there left fer me here you refuse to introduce me to that hot cuz of yours kiara
1956674 yeah desu kinoseki heres a loser but cmon i am definitely a great catch for that cousin of yours
1956675 shuddup bouretti youre a sleaze ball as if someone as classy as miss kiara would fall for the likes of you
1956676 boys boys down you rookie stop gaping at those two losers an follow me
1956677 yo bouretti you think this rookie will fare better than the others
1956678 thats a very interesting blade youve got there seifer mind if i take a look
1956679 yeah but from time to time i like to tinker with gunblades
1956680 no as a matter of fact im not im even quite adept with one smirk of course not up to your standards almasy
1956681 seifer did you know that the kurogane which makes up hyperions blade is extremely rare
1956682 thats the name of the black alloy from which your blade has been forged
1956683 fuck if i do all i need to know is that i can slice through tough ruby dragon skin
1956684 hmmn after examining your weapon i think i can improve it specially now that you are in synch with tiamat
1956685 because of the nature of the strange alloy that makes up your blade and in part the gun as well i think i can modify your weapon in such a way that when you junction tiamat hyperion will also benefit from it
1956686 fuck ill agree to anything that can increase my power
1956687 so be it smirk where would the fun be otherwise
1956688 why instructor im hurt ive been at my best behaviour
1956689 dont you dare give me that do you know who it was that you were so rude to a few minutes ago
1956690 you were rude to minister stanley cole gardens ally and leader of the upper house
1956691 that sleazebag just wanted to get into your pants trepe
1956692 do i need to pull rank on you here squad leader
1956693 meh hell get over it after a minor confrontation with another wendigo
1956694 i wanna hear the stowry bout the dragon n the lady n the knight

1956696 everyone should be in bed by the time i count to ten one
1956697 nine squall dont place the covers over your head dear youll suffocate ten
1956698 the north wind heard the same wish and felt pity for the small garden it also asked the flower seeds it carried in its airstream the same question but it got the same reply no and so did the west wind and so did the south wind every seed they asked said no until one very tiny flower seed out of all seeds asked volunteered to go it said it pains me to leave my siblings but for the sake of the lonely garden i will go ah there was such joy in that tiny garden when the flower seed landed
1956699 maybe someday selphie the fruit tree extended its branches to shelter the small flower seed from the strong rays of the sun the grass made a space for it to root
1956700 id like to be in that garden too dyou dyou think id be allowed to touch the pretty flower
1956701 what kind of sissy question is that youre such a girl
1956702 i hope the highway patrols stop that dangerous speed punk
1956703 hey seifer that frown will definitely kill your good looks
1956704 i know some of you guys dont want to be caught by some monster with your pants down while youre taking a shit
1956705 but shouldnt we be discussing where garden is to be built before we decide if e garden is just to become a huge lavatory facility
1956706 seifer you should take the opportunity that president laguna has given you to raise your seed ranking it should be childs play for someone with your ability
1956707 with all of my seed credentials and my superior ranking im by far the most obvious choice to be squad leader
1956708 humph i shouldve known better probably got someone back home
1956709 hey kia will ya stop ogling him and pay some attention to this
1956710 uh kia dyou really know what youre doin with that almasy guy
1956711 nah but im afraid this guy can really hurt you
1956712 dear resident the use of excessive force will result in system malfunction
1956713 hyne seifer why do you always have to be so impatient
1956714 im not sure but i think that whirlwind over there
1956715 yo ren calm down kay i know all bout these suckers
1956716 sigh oh hell everyone friggin calm down were heading north that storms blowin to the west sides it only looks close but its way off
1956717 squad leader i scanned the horizon with the zoomscope an nothin everywhere i checked looks the same as the last place i checked
1956718 towards the east a couple of degrees north almost like following the wake of the last sandstorm
1956719 oh sorry zell i was speaking to myself quistis and i talked bout it when i was helping her assemble together those notes she left for you
1956720 wow youre so lucky you got to speak with instructor trepe susana that almasy guys sooo mean an sooo scary
1956721 well as you know quistis and i found a very ancient record in the shumi database because it was a protected one we had to ask the headmaster himself to request permission from the shumi elder to allow us access
1956722 yeah i was kinda surprised that the elder said yes
1956723 i agree the shumis are known for being very tight lipped about their sealed knowledge but yeah the elder was very forthcoming with the information we got the material very quickly but to our dismay great chunks of it were written in a language weve never seen before
1956724 as i was saying we both examined closely the ideograms used in the old records
1956725 yeah anyway instructor aki is very knowledgeable of ancient scripts because of their magic incantations i think at one point the instructor even served as advisor to odine when master norg brought the doctor over to discuss the possibilities of gf junctions
1956726 i know su were supposed to be lookin for an underground city cuz that would explain the part bout
1956727 huh what was it called before if not abadan an how dyou know
1956728 well its not something we can use to help us now zell i mean this map looks nothing like today
1956729 yes it seems that something similar but more devastating happened in esthar continent maybe a thousand years ago
1956730 so that pupurun sea in southern esthar was a result of that nevertheless
1956731 huh are you saying that you agree with that theres no scientific evidence to support that
1956732 no i was thinkin that you and aki are really good su
1956733 blush actually we couldnt make sense of the map so instructor akis good friend professor thiongo from balamb university was drafted in to help us
1956734 glare zell prof thiongo is a world renowned historical cartographer we were lucky to secure his help all thanks to instructor aki
1956735 uh sure su so the shumis were okay with that
1956736 the elder agreed to give permission only if prof thiongo were to take the oath of secrecy
1956737 well yeah to have access to such a rare and ancient artefact let alone being able to touch it was like a dream come true for the professor
1956738 the shumi elder included you in the pledge in fact the elder included all of mrs
1956739 but im pretty sure the elder said seven children but theres only six of you in garden zell whos the seventh
1956740 i thought she was only a good friend of mrs kramers
1956741 oh in any case going back to the map it was professor thiongo who determined that the second migration wave started somewhere on present day abadan plains and moved slowly southwest towards the talle mountain range
1956742 professor thiongo knows a bit more of the old languages given his line of work and says those people called themselves kaskabad
1956743 damn thats why selph gave me all those sandstorm scans
1956744 meh its okay su youre tellin me now so thats what matters anyway good job
1956745 err blush thanks zell it means a lot to me
1956746 yo zell over here i looked in the direction that susana indicated an i see another sandstorm brewing in that area
1956747 bunch of losers thatll teach ya to piss me off lets go
1956748 thank you saedi please tell her ill be there shortly

1956768 oh may i inquire as to why you decline the nomination isnt your family seat in trabia
1956769 good morning instructor legrand the headmaster is waiting for you
1956770 i just got off the phone with fabiani he will be resigning his post at years end as trabia gardens commander and headmaster this is our opportunity to act
1956771 sir i heard rumours that the council wanted to split the post
1956772 nonsense thats just mere rumour its not in the best interests of garden organization to break up such an important position
1956773 andr i want you to pick an elite group of seed and lead them in lunatic pandora this should boost up your profile before garden council and improve our chances of controlling trabia garden we cannot allow it to go the same route as balamb
1956774 while youre at it keep an eye on that punk almasy
1956775 i dont know yet what kramer and that idiotic president of esthar were planning when they named almasy to lead the security side of the lunatic pandora project but quistis trepe has been assigned to him as aide maybe if we play our cards right she might be persuaded to join our side she cannot be very happy now that such a top notch seed as she is has been overlooked for the post and made to play nanny to that low ranking punk
1956776 sir as ive stated in my report the kramers seem to have a very special relationship with almasy as well as with trepe
1956777 you can also add leonhart kinneas dincht and tilmitt to the mix andr
1956778 i know all about that dont forget who else is residing in balamb garden
1956779 exactly hes been keeping tabs on her as much as he can i have to admit that for all their laxity inside its been impossible for him to penetrate their security in any case you can rest assured that when the time comes we have caraways full support
1956780 understood sir ill do whatever i can to extract as much information as i can
1956781 dismissed mrs zucchero will fill you in with the details
1956782 you are such a wuss would i have instructed decker to bring us here had i not been sure

1956793 so instructor trepe are you gonna have a go at it
1956794 but ill say you need to pack in some extra weight instructor
1956795 whats the big deal trepe its not exactly a secret i was a sorceresss knight those trials were broadcast worldwide remember
1956796 the mask is the same but im pretty sure this is a different fucker
1956797 you know i got irvines account of the escape but i havent heard your take on seifer youre not listening
1956798 dont make me do it for you you wouldnt like it
1956799 dont worry seify already got in touch with the headmaster and with squall
1956800 imagine getting a call in the middle of the night not only from matron but from uncle laguna as well we rushed over here
1956801 will you stop apologizing already my dress was absolutely intact
1956802 im so glad you have no idea how they got that way
1956803 i know seifer told us he used the bags like a weapon ill have to remember that one next time johan complains that i like shopping too much
1956804 im feeling fine thank you when do you think ill be discharged
1956805 so instructor im amazed you havent asked for leave to visit timber
1956806 youre needed here trepe and besides itll be a good experience for that jackass he wanted to be team leader i gave him the opportunity to be one
1956807 so you sent him to fight malboros dont you think that i would be more suitable for the job
1956808 whats the matter trepe all of a sudden you look like you swallowed somethin real acid
1956809 uh i of course i want to be there but can we get the time off
1956810 we can if we fly in and out the same day
1956811 quistis child we have a very great favour to ask of you
1956812 quistis youre needed to act as seifers aid in esthar they want to make him commander but he needs your guidance
1956813 sis im so glad you called i couldnt figure out the store location there are so many choices here
1956814 oh quisty why didnt you use the convenience vehicle uncle laguna left for you
1956815 heres the dress my dear all packaged and ready to go it was very nice for you to pick it up on miss loires behalf
1956816 it was no trouble ellone is extremely busy these days and i had the day off
1956817 if you dont mind me saying so young lady you should come when mme cheryl is in im sure she would love to create a dress for you
1956818 hyne seifer why do you always have to be so impatient
1956819 uh i was sent here by the headmaster to act as your aide in e garden development
1956820 were going to be fucking late either you ride in the back or i fucking scoop you up again and you ride seated on my lap
1956821 and believe me trepe ill enjoy it much more than you
1956822 listen up everyone this is instructor trepe shes been assigned by garden to act as my aide
1956823 instructor trepe is to work mainly in the development of esthar garden but she will also be acting as my second in command
1956824 hi someone here pointed out to me that youre seifers instructor
1956825 but as you can see he has more than graduated
1956826 oh i see so why does he still call you instructor then you cannot be that much older than he is
1956827 its okay some relationships are hard to shake off and i am older than seifer
1956828 he and i grew up together you see we were raised together
1956829 oh i see so youre sort of like an older sister to him
1956830 to kiaras idea to quistiss utter surprise kiara did not bother to argue with him perhaps because he spent most of his free time with her it also helped that kiara believed her relationship with seifer to be that of siblings
1956831 yeah i remembered yours got trashed at centra happy birthday trepe
1956832 how bout a thank you very much seifer for starters
1956833 uh nah kiara i think we should cool it off between us
1956834 kia i enjoyed what we had but i think is better for both of us to move on
1956835 ever since she arrived youve become more and more distant with me
1956836 it wasnt only about sex i did i do care for you but i cant give you what youre asking why cant you understand that
1956837 the temptation is great but no it would only make it worse in the end for the both of us
1956838 if you must know i was having a very nice dinner in a restaurant on my day off before you so rudely interrupted
1956839 hyne seifer whats got into you why were you so rude to that poor waiter
1956840 how is it my fault that you behaved like a barbarian
1956841 tch tch knight you should not make the blue witch angry
1956842 how many badly dressed fuckers like you are out there pops
1956843 you shall set out after the sounding of the waking gongs yusuf shall be your guide iolanthe and omar shall accompany you as well
1956844 no my daughter i believe the time has come to lift the interdiction im sending you to scout the above yusuf is one of the few who still remembers the way upwards the way was fraught with danger in the past and it has become worse now omar and iolanthe are very capable warriors you shall be needing their support
1956845 behold the ashura my child this weapon was wielded by onna erythraeas daughter and from her in direct succession mother to daughter to us her descendents
1956846 you dreamt of your own destiny my daughter now you must learn to fulfil it
1956847 no words exist that can best describe the mysterious city of baal the last refuge of the kashkabald people
1956848 the flight from astaroth was long and hard in the end the lady chose to stay behind after sealing the secret stairway with the following caveat impia tortorum longos hic turba furores sanguinis innocui non satiata aluit child of my flesh child of the future in time you will understand the heavy portend of this warning these words are not to be taken lightly for they belong to the order of zaruthra i ormus know that one day you my descendent shall be reading this which i have written with the same terrible certainty i know the order or zaruthra will also have prevailed and survived the great cataclysm perhaps in your time their guise will have changed but certainly not their manner they are not to be trusted
1956849 please forgive this slight deviation from the narrative but i beg you to take heed of my advice
1956850 as i mentioned after we sealed the secret stairway my lady decided to make her last stand by stalling our attackers in the throne room
1956851 nothing i said would make my lady deviate from her resolve like the lord odin she entrusted me with the care of the twins to honour her i took oath upon the blood of my ancestors that i would do whatever was needed to ensure that the children reach their destination dohletia had to be taken north her brother ishtarius to the south the oath i made binds all those who carry my blood with the deepest magic to fulfil the promise
1956852 the enemy was wily and full of malice but the lady xioma came from a powerful lineage of blue magic casters
1956853 zuleima you must prepare yourself for the unforeseen the book of ormus which had long been held in our possession has claimed you as its reader
1956854 no my daughter in time you will understand the significance of my words
1956855 such a confused little boy are you going to step forward retreat you have to decide
1956856 the boy in you is telling you to come the adult in you is telling you to back off you cant make up your mind you dont know the right answer you want help dont you you want to be saved from this predicament
1956857 dont be ashamed to ask for help besides youre only a little boy
1956858 come with me to a place of no return bid farewell to your childhood
1956859 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1956860 obama presents not ideas but feelings he is the candidate of emotivism obamian passion is based on the persona that his followers have created for obama in their own minds many dont know who the man really is
1956861 the hard core radicalism of the 1960s era and chicagos machine politics
1956862 h e is simply another liberal democratic politician who will divide america along the same lines as it has been divided for decades
1956863 barack obama is not to be criticized he is above that sort of thing he is immune to criticism
1956864 its just that hes like all the rest of them not a reformer not a messiah just like all the rest of them in washington and just like all the other liberals too
1956865 new point of agreement between liberals and conservatives that the clintons are a dangerous and cutthroat pair that will do absolutely anything to win and cling to power
1956866 obama co sponsored a bill in 1997 that required certain municipalities to create affordable housing funds using revenues from bonds among other things the funds were to be used to preserve existing buildings and to subsidize construction of new ones
1956867 in 2001 obama co sponsored and passed legislation that increased such developers state subsidies by creating an affordable housing tax credit in other words if you donated land or money to a state approved affordable housing project you got half of the value back in tax credits which could be carried forward to future tax years
1956868 in 2003 obama co sponsored the illinois housing initiative act of 2003 which required the governor to develop a plan for more low income housing the bill also would have provide d for funding for housing construction and rehabilitation and supportive services
1956869 what sort of nominations does such a man make as president what kind of diplomacy does he pursue given that so much of diplomacy consists in reading understanding and judging others intentions and character this is why these ties deserve scrutiny if barack obama becomes president his good judgment or lack thereof will affect the entire country
1956870 understanding tribal loyalties political motivations and family relationships was essential to defeating the enemy we face a task more akin to breaking up a mafia crime ring than dismantling a conventional enemy battalion or brigade link diagrams depicting who talked with whom became a daily chore for a small intelligence staff more used to analyzing the ranges of enemy artillery systems

1956872 section 8 which refers to us militarys section 8 discharge for mentally unfit personnel after section viii of world war ii us army regulation 615 360 which is not to be confused with the
1956873 holy crap my kid just did something incredibly dangerous and stupid
1956874 and in the end the love you make is equal to the love you take
1956875 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1956876 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

1956889 bishan lensman draws net they focus on his eccentric behaviour in taking photos said to be of young people by chong chee kin crime correspondent picture mr daniel cheng above hangs out at fast food restaurants at junction 8 mall for hours taking pictures with his cellphone numerous blogs on the internet have been discussing his eccentric behaviour but mr cheng says he takes pictures of only bishans scenery lim wui liang the straits times part time tutor daniel cheng is a familiar face at fast food outlets in bishans junction 8 mall the 46 year old is the man seated at one end of the restaurant be it kfc or mcdonalds for hours on end his reverie is broken occasionally when he picks up his camera phone and appears to train it on the restaurant patrons his antics have not gone unnoticed marcus lin 17 from the nearby technical institute who hangs out at the mall said we try to avoid him everyone here knows him hes always there listening to his cd player and taking pictures with his mobile phone mr cheng has attracted no small measure of internet infamy as well with numerous blogs giving details of his eccentric behaviour there are even videos posted on youtube of him in action which attracted close to 1 000 eyeballs the comments are hardly flattering with netizens mostly students giving him the moniker bishan gay because of his odd behaviour when the straits times caught up with him late last month the stocky man covered his mouth with his hands and chortled when told about the blogs im not aware of these at all im not a celebrity i never read blogs because they are not examples of true objective journalism he said not once did he ask about what was written about him online nor was he curious to find out who the bloggers were even when told of what had been said about him and his anointed nickname mr cheng who is single did not bat an eyelid dismissing it with a wave of his hand he said he was not bothered by the accusations because they were all untrue im not a celebrity or anyone famous what can i do about them anyway a lawsuit costs a lot of money and it takes a few years before it can be completed by the end of it i will be so drained he was told that people could be discomfited by his behaviour of snapping pictures and recording videos of strangers no that could not be the case mr cheng insisted i am taking pictures of only bishans scenery i love bishan and i feel very attached to the place which is why i still come back here after moving to ang mo kio he said another reason he said he is attached to his alma mater raffles institution ri which moved from grange road to its present bishan campus in 1990 when contacted ri deputy headmaster kenneth kwok said the school was aware that the boys knew of mr cheng we do not encourage our boys to engage in any name calling we also emphasise to our boys the need for personal safety when they interact with any strangers he said mr cheng claimed to know many ri boys attending alumni functions and fund raising fun fairs he is often seen wearing t shirts linked to the school i feel responsible for these boys and i just want to guide and help them if they need it he said when asked why he was still so involved with the school after so many years no one he said had ever told him off to his face that might be the case but talking behind his back is a favourite pastime of those in the area the straits times observed him for nearly six hours on a tuesday starting from 10am till about 4pm at a fast food outlet at junction 8 mall and on bus service 156 he seemed oblivious to the attention he attracted some teenagers gave him a wide berth at the restaurant others pointed him out to their friends and spoke in hushed voices about how he was always hanging around in the area some even chided their friends for sitting near him andrew chan 16 was one of the students who spotted him at bishan and told the two friends he was with to sit far away from the man if mr cheng was aware of the students discomfort he did not show it that tuesday he snapped pictures with his camera phone while in the restaurant where he sat for four hours nursing two cups of tea he then headed to the nearby coffee shop for about 20 minutes where he had lunch and carried on taking more photos he boarded bus service 156 outside bishan mrt got off three stops later near mount alvernia hospital and crossed the road to the bus stop by macritchie reservoir here he spent half an hour before taking the same bus service again this time in the opposite direction taking snapshots both at the bus stop and on the packed bus full of students from ri and hwa chong institution after alighting in ang mo kio he was last seen crossing the road once more for the opposite bus stop altogether the straits times saw him take at least 19 photos during the day he certainly got an eyeful of bishan cheekin sph com sg additional reporting by tan wei zhao some blog entries smiles are ok i know he smiles at boys perhaps that is because he was from ri and liked the times he had there looks are deceiving it is the heart that counts a smile brightens up the world sajer author of the forgotten realm hes a celebrity i saw the infamous bishan gay today wanted to ask him for his autograph like i mean not everyday do you meet someone whom everyone else in your whole school and also in the whole district knows right ron author of ronnnnn too many times i hate to confess but ive encountered him enough times to give me goosebumps alif author of my soliloquy a nice dude i spoke

1956892 senator kerry talked of reducing terrorism to quote nuisance end quote and compared it to prostitution and illegal gambling
1956893 see i couldnt disagree more our goal is not to reduce terror to some acceptable level of nuisance our goal is to defeat terror by staying on the offensive destroying terrorists and spreading freedom and liberty around the world
1956894 victory will include discrediting extremist ideology creating fissures between and among extremist groups and reducing them to the level of nuisance groups that can be tracked and handled by law enforcement capabilities

1956899 if you say that because you are born with a certain inclination then it is god given and you should be free to follow that through in your life it doesnt make any logical sense whatever
1956900 it has not yet been conclusively shown that for some males and some females homosexuality and homosexual acts are natural rather than unnatural if such comes to be shown it will be necessary to acknowledge the full implications of that new aspect of the truth and that insight applied to establish and acknowledge what may be a new status for homosexual relationships within the church
1956901 in less than fifty years time our nations political leaders legislative bodies and courts have adopted a distinctly anti christian attitude and agenda the country has swept away the christian worldview and its principles in the name of equal rights political correctness tolerance and strict separation of church and state gross immorality including homosexuality abortion pornography and other evils has been sanctioned not only by society in general but in effect by the government as well a portion of our tax dollars are now used to fund programs and government agencies that actively engage in blatant advocacy of various immoral practices what are christians to do about it many think this is a political problem that will not be solved without a political strategy but is that a proper perspective i believe not americas moral decline is a spiritual problem not a political one and its solution is the gospel not partisan politics
1956902 evangelical activists in essence are simply preaching a politically conservative version of the old social gospel emphasizing social and cultural concerns above spiritual ones that kind of thinking fosters the view that government is either our ally if it supports our special agenda or our enemy if it remains opposed or unresponsive to our voice the political strategy becomes the focus of everything as if the spiritual fortunes of gods people rise or fall depending on who is in office but the truth is that no human government can ultimately do anything either to advance or to thwart gods kingdom and the worst most despotic worldly government in the end cannot halt the power of the holy spirit or the spread of gods word
1956903 my point is not that christians should remain totally uninvolved in politics or civic activities and causes
1956904 therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all especially to those who are of the household of faith
1956905 we cant protect or expand the cause of christ by human political and social activism no matter how great or sincere the efforts ours is a spiritual battle waged against worldly ideologies and dogmas arrayed against god and we achieve victory over them only with the weapon of scripture the apostle paul writes for though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in god for pulling down strongholds casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ 2 cor 10 3 5
1956906 god has above all else called the church to bring sinful people to salvation through jesus christ
1956907 to open their eyes in order to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me christ

1956937 its true that we dont exactly represent a majority of secular kibbutz members but the pioneers have always been a minority the zionists were a minority among the jews those who came to the land were a minority among the zionists those who worked the land were also a minority and now we are a minority as well but i hope that soon we will be the leaders
1956938 well the word religious can be the subject of long discussions look the gerrer rebbe once said when the haskalah enlightenment came to the world with science physics etc we the religious left it for the secular jews when zionism came to the world we gave that too to the secular and now we have also left the repentance movement for the secular accordingly it looks like we the secular will also have to build the beit hamikdash
1956939 there are many religious authorities including maimonides who say that the temple must be rebuilt and so i think it should be done as a first step we must show that we control the temple mount i call upon all of israel to come to the mount on tisha bav and show that it belongs to the jewish nation

1957075 its sic also a fact that the library cannot digitize the vast bulk of its holdings while the u s copyright law remains in effect
1957076 the point is this while digitization projects are useful and prestigious they provide access to only a microscopic portion of the library s collections and for that reason should not be regarded as core functions that are more important than existing operations such as our cataloging and classification work

1957146 weer aan het werk gaan en worden geconfronteerd met gebak bij de koffie gaan solliciteren en gevraagd worden naar het gat op je cv een nieuwe relatie krijgen en je voor het eerst in het bijzijn van de ander uitkleden dat zorgt voor spanningen en onzekerheid en omdat eten je zwakke plek is val je al snel terug dat is niet zo gek het hoort erbij maar het is essentieel dat je erover praat anders verval je weer in stiekem gedrag niet eten smoezen verzinnen vreetbuien en kan de eetstoornis er weer insluipen in de nazorgzelfhulpgroepen vinden mensen herkenning en veiligheid en kunnen ze het laatste stukje van de stoornis loslaten
1957147 ik kwam op een gewicht van 43 kilo en dat bleef stabiel dat was mager maar ik zag dat zelf niet zo ik functioneerde goed deed bijvoorbeeld een opleiding had sociale contacten en woonde samen dus wat was dan het probleem dat heb ik zeven jaar volgehouden toen ik mijn diploma had gehaald vond ik mezelf sterk genoeg om mijn incestverleden te verwerken met hulp van een therapeut van de riagg lukte at ik voelde me zo sterk dat ik een nazorggroep voor anorexia en boulimiapati nten wilde gaan begeleiden leek me leuk als ex pati nt bij mijn eerste bezoek aan die organisatie herkende ik echter allerlei verhalen van anderen superconfronterend ik was nog lang niet van mijn eetstoornis af ik ben dus maar eerst zelf in zon groep gegaan met daarnaast hulp van een di tist was in een jaar tijd de knop om dat is nu twee jaar geleden de eetstoornis komt nooit meer terug
1957148 dat zijn de mensen die ondanks verschillende behandelingen toch steeds weer terugvallen helaas is dat nog steeds een vrij grote groep maar de hulpverlening wordt steeds deskundiger en gestructureerder het wachten is op meer onderzoek zodat ooit duidelijk wordt hoe anorexia en boulimia voor een grotere groep effectief te behandelen is
1957149 na de opname in een kliniek voor eetstoornissen is het loslaten van mijn ziekte eigenlijk pas echt begonnen een verdere zoektocht naar mezelf het winnen van zelfvertrouwen het overwinnen van de angst alles los te laten wat zo lang veilig was geweest de eetstoornis begon in een tijd waarin ik erg onzeker was we waren net verhuisd en ik werd gepest op de nieuwe school daardoor kreeg ik het idee iemand anders te moeten zijn dan ik werkelijk was daarbij deed ik intensief aan ballet en was er heftige concurrentie tussen de meisjes op het gebied van gewicht daarmee is de anorexia begonnen en mijn idiote idee n over afvallen ik danste veel op mijn slaapkamer en ik dacht dat ik als ik drie elpees gedanst had een halve kilo kwijt was ruim tien jaar leefde ik een dubbelleven ik studeerde werkte was aardig tegen iedereen maar aan de andere kant had ik in het geheim soms wel zeven vreetbuien per dag en braakte ik even zo vaak alles weer uit de stoornis beschermde me tegen alles waar ik bang voor was het was mijn mantel waar ik in kon kruipen mijn onzekerheid probeerde ik niet te voelen door me voortdurend aan anderen aan te passen maar daardoor raakte ik wel mezelf kwijt uiteindelijk ging het z slecht met me dat ik werd opgenomen in een kliniek de behandeling daar was niet alleen gericht op het bereiken van een normaal eetpatroon maar vooral op het terugvinden van mezelf in de groep in de kliniek voelde ik me veilig dus daar leerde ik te zeggen wat ik wilde en hoe sterker ik werd hoe minder eng het was de eetstoornis verder los te laten tot na negen maanden de kliniek een te veilige plek werd ik was sterk genoeg om de onveiligheid van de buitenwereld tegemoet te gaan ik merkte dat ik nog niet helemaal van de stoornis af was ik was veranderd maar wist niet goed wat ik daarmee aan moest een hoop tijd weinig zelfvertrouwen nog geen baan en ik wist niet wat ik wilde ik besloot gastlessen over eetstoornissen te gaan geven op middelbare scholen telkens weer mijn verbaal doen zorgde ervoor dat ik de jaren die achter me lagen kon verwerken de veliligheid vond ik meer en meer bij mezelf en ik kon steeds vaker kleine dingen loslaten tot het moment waarop ik mijn eetstoornis niet meer nodig had als ik nu eens een onzekere bui heb spreek ik dat uit dat helpt en eten zoals ik vroeger gedaan zou bebben komt dan niet eens in me op ik eet als ik honger heb of trek ja k een patatje na het stappen
1957150 ik kom er steeds meer achter waarom ik deze ziekte eigenlijk gekregen heb het heeft te maken met angst ik ben bang am alleen te zijn bang om keuzes te maken bang om dingen verkeerd te doen het is een bestaansangst die heb ik overgenomen van mijn moeder mijn vader en moeder zijn allebei joods en mijn moeder hoeft een traumatisch oorlogsverleden ik heb een sterke band met haar en denk dat ik haar traumas al vroeg heb opgepikt niet eten of heel weinig eten zorgt ervoor dat ik tenminste op dat vlak van mijn leven grip heb ik was al op jonge leeftijd een angstig meisje vrolijk aan de buitenkant met iedereen kletsend maar toch bang mijn rol in het gezin en in vriendinnengroepjes was dat ik zorgde voor vrolijkbeid die rol stond me steeds meer tegen omdat ik me daardoor niet serieus genomen voelde dus besloot ik dat ik anders zou worden niet meer de wat mollige clown met kort haar maar slank en met lang haar ik ging lijnen maar terwijl ik steeds magerder werd werd ik ook steeds somberder ik ging moeilijker in het leven staan stresste overal over zag overal problemen ik heb nu zeventien jaar anorexia maar er zijn ook periodes geweest dat het heel goed met me ging ik heb gemerkt dat best aardig gaat als ik niet te hoge eisen stel aan mezelf als ik gewoon een leuk baantje heb een fijne plek om te wonen en vrienden en vriendinnen om me heen ik werk nu vrijwillig bij een kapperszaak daar veeg ik de vloer en was ik het haar van de klanten ze waarderen me daar en ik ben echt blij met dat werk en dat terwiji ik een vwo diploma heb en eigenlijk veel meer kan maar ik denk dat ik dat idee moet loslaten net zoals andere dingen waar mensen van mijn leeftijd mee bezig zijn kinderen krijgen bijvoorbeeld mijn eetstoornis hoort zo bij me dat ik me niet kan voorstellen hoe het is om zonder te leven ik wil er wel vanaf alles wat ik dacht dat niet eten me zou brengen is niet uitgekomen ik ben niet gelukkiger geworden niet zelfverzekerder niet eten geeft me geen grip op mijn leven maar ontneemt me dat juist hoe het verder moet weet ik niet ik heb overwogen een echt diepgaande therapie te zoeken die de angst uit me haalt maar misschien is het wel beter om te leren leven met de angst met mezelf als dat lukt heb ik de ziekte misschien niet meer nodig
1957151 ik heb nog steeds karaktertrekjes die er jaren geleden toe hebben bijgedragen dat ik een eetstoornis kreeg ik heb bijvoorbeeld nog steeds de neiging mezelf minder waard te vinden dan anderen niet de leiding te nemen maar te volgen ook het perfectionisme ben ik nog niet kwijt en ik heb nog niet geleerd assertief te zijn juist doordat ik dat allemaal nog in me heb kan ik me nog voorstellen dat ik het was die acht jaar lang anorexia had maar opnieuw ziek worden nee ik heb die eigenschappen maar ze zijn tot normale proporties teruggebracht het begon op de middelbare school iemand maakte een opmerking over mijn dikke kont en dus ging ik lijnen ik merkte dat lijnen kilos verliezen en daar zelf grip op hebben houvast gaf en daar was ik naar op zoek ik was erg gevoelig voor wat anderen van me dachten en ik geloofde dat ik er helemaal bij zou horen als ik maar dun genoeg zou zijn maar in plaats van dat ik meer vriendinnen kreeg raakte ik door de ziekte steeds ge soleerder ik schaamde me ervoor maar kon de anorexia die afgewisseld werd met boulimia niet loslaten daarvoor is toch in de eerste plaats nodig dat je inziet dat je ziek bent en dat zag ik niet ik koos er toch zelf voor om zo met eten om te gaan nu pas zie ik dat het geen keus was dat ik al lang niet meer anders kon maar die gedachte heeft er wel voor gezorgd dat ik nooit professionele hulp zocht zonde want met goede hulp had het vast geen acht jaar geduurd voor ik er eindelijk vanaf was het ging langzaamaan beter toen ik volwassener werd ik ging mezelf steeds meer accepteren zoals ik was wat ook meespeelde de anorexia en boulimia zorgden voor allerlei lichamelijke klachten een zere maag na een vreetbui bloed in de ontlasting een zere keel door het overgeven opgezette speekselklieren ik raakte gemotiveerd iets aan mijn eetprobleem te doen doordat ik besefte dat ik mezelf aan het slopen was maar het heeft nog jaren geduurd voor ik echt kon zeggen dat ik genezen was voor ik de patronen in mijn gedrag en mijn gedachten door had en kon veranderen daardoor heb ik mezelf goed leren kennen en weet ik nu wat mijn kwetsbare punten zijn ik kan ze vroeg signaleren en mezelf dus op tijd terugfluiten verwacht ik bijvoorbeeld te veel van mezelf dan lukt het me om even stil te staan en na te denken over wat echt belangrijk is omdat ik nu beter kan relativeren weet ik dat ik geen eetstoornis meer zal krijgen

1957218 bloodshed in south ossetia will be on their conscience we will protect our peacekeepers and citizens of the russian federation
1957219 russia must intervene in the conflict to end the violence
1957220 russia must consider the military operation because our peacekeeping contingent will not be sufficient to ensure peace in the region

1957247 it is absolutely clear why for quite a long period of time tbilisi shunned concluding binding and legal agreements with south ossetia and abkhazia to abjure force in the settlement of these disputes still there is enough time to prevent mass bloodshed and new victims amongst civilians we are also deeply concerned about the fate of the russian peacekeepers in the conflict zone the georgian leadership must change its mind and return to civilised means to resolve the complex questions involved in this matter

1957250 vendor c is still in the game theyre offering 42 500 they must really want to get their foot in the door of our company because we know theres no profit in that ridiculously low amount
1957251 in less than fifty years time our nations political leaders legislative bodies and courts have adopted a distinctly anti christian attitude and agenda the country has swept away the christian worldview and its principles in the name of equal rights political correctness tolerance and strict separation of church and state gross immorality including homosexuality abortion pornography and other evils has been sanctioned not only by society in general but in effect by the government as well a portion of our tax dollars are now used to fund programs and government agencies that actively engage in blatant advocacy of various immoral practices what are christians to do about it many think this is a political problem that will not be solved without a political strategy but is that a proper perspective i believe not americas moral decline is a spiritual problem not a political one and its solution is the gospel not partisan politics
1957252 evangelical activists in essence are simply preaching a politically conservative version of the old social gospel emphasizing social and cultural concerns above spiritual ones that kind of thinking fosters the view that government is either our ally if it supports our special agenda or our enemy if it remains opposed or unresponsive to our voice the political strategy becomes the focus of everything as if the spiritual fortunes of gods people rise or fall depending on who is in office but the truth is that no human government can ultimately do anything either to advance or to thwart gods kingdom and the worst most despotic worldly government in the end cannot halt the power of the holy spirit or the spread of gods word
1957253 my point is not that christians should remain totally uninvolved in politics or civic activities and causes
1957254 therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all especially to those who are of the household of faith
1957255 we cant protect or expand the cause of christ by human political and social activism no matter how great or sincere the efforts ours is a spiritual battle waged against worldly ideologies and dogmas arrayed against god and we achieve victory over them only with the weapon of scripture the apostle paul writes for though we walk in the flesh we do not war according to the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in god for pulling down strongholds casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ 2 cor 10 3 5
1957256 god has above all else called the church to bring sinful people to salvation through jesus christ
1957257 to open their eyes in order to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me christ
1957258 by means of faithful preaching and godly living believers are to be the conscience of whatever nation they reside in

1957314 come my friend let me embrace you and exchange burdens with you for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

1957317 when i had the impulse to learn to knit some hats for innocent this year my utmost ambition was to make 5 hats one a week
1957318 when i asked the bloke in the shop he just replied well its just they get a bit cold in the fridge
1957319 and this i pray that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment that you may approve the things that are excellent that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of christ
1957320 i have found in speaking to various non lds groups in different cultures that we can teach and testify of many gospel principles the law of eternal progression if we are careful in selecting words which carry our meaning but come from their experience and frame of mind
1957321 the gospel of john the epistles of paul and peter the book of mormon and the doctrines and covenants
1957322 cultivate the habit of reading the scriptures everyday perhaps just before retiring its better to sleep on helaman or moroni books in the book of mormon than on the latest tv talk show
1957323 natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real just as unchanging and unarguably there as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension
1957324 enable the individual personality to grow and develop until eventually he can become like his father in heaven
1957325 renewal is the principle and the process that empowers us to move on an upward spiral of growth and change of continuous improvement
1957326 the more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws the more accurate and functional they will be correct maps will infinitely impact our personal and interpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expanded on changing our attitudes and behaviors
1957327 no wonder jospeh smith under inspiration identified the creeds of the fathers as the very mainspring of all corruption
1957328 test all things hold fast that which is good abstain from every form of evil
1957329 es war ein sehr gutes gespr ch wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt sicher wird unser erfolg bei der wm 2006 dank des elfmeterschie ens gegen argentinien immer eng mit seinem namen verbunden bleiben aber auch bei der euro 2008 hatte er einen genauso gro en anteil an unserem erfolg er hat viel f r den deutschen fu ball geleistet und war f r mich stets ein wichtiger ansprechpartner

1957331 for everyone will be tested with fire e 50 salt is good for seasoning but if it loses its flavor how do you make it salty again you must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other
1957332 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1957333 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
1957334 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1957335 if our use of fossil fuels is increasing our reliance on middle eastern dictators while destroying the planet maybe we ought to use less
1957336 we can use those twisty carbon fluorescent light bulbs we can unplug our televisions computers and phone chargers when were not using them
1957337 its sad to see mccains campaign adopting the politics of the tire gauge promoting the fallacy that americans are powerless to address their own energy problems

1957345 long term mortgage rates continued to move lower for a third consecutive week in part reflecting a moderation in core inflation
1957346 in the statement accompanying their decision to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged the fed noted that core inflation had declined recently though a sustained moderation is still to be seen and signaled that inflation risk continues to figure prominently in their policy decisions
1957347 helping to ease some inflation concerns mays personal consumption expenditures report found that the core price measure had increased 1 9 percent for the year ending in may within the 1 percent to 2 percent range with which the fed is comfortable and the lowest year over year rise in more than 3 years

1957355 take care protect yourself against the least bit of greed life is not defined by what you have even when you have a lot

1957367 here are a number of key factors we look at when evaluating the potential for village phone in a specific market rural telecommunications coverage does telecommunications coverage extend out into rural areas or is it concentrated in urban settings while the external antenna we use can extend the reach up to 35km from a base station if there is no base station within 35km of a potential village phone operator there is no way they can get a signal for their phone strength of microfinance sector how many microfinance institutions are in the country what is their outreach i e how many clients do they have are those clients in urban or rural settings rural demand are there any alternatives for making public access calls how far do people travel to make a phone call what percentage of people own their own mobile phone now a market well suited for village phone is one where there is coverage in rural areas a strong microfinance presence in rural areas to act as your channel to market and high unmet demand for public access telecommunication services

1957370 the president can declare to the office of the presidency powers usually assumed by dictators to direct any and all government and business activities until the emergency is declared over
1957371 likewise the spirit helps us in our weakness for we do not know what to pray for as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words and he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of god

1957378 im always on to my next film and beyond that
1957379 i never get bogged down in what audiences think or what critics think or what friends think or anything because if i did id be paralyzed i try and keep my mind completely blank and not think at all about what i do
1957380 has a natural flowing vitality to it a sun drenched splendor that never falters
1957381 thats exactly the point of the picture really that you are who you are and you are always going to be who you are
1957382 since moneys always a factor with me in getting films financed i said sure
1957383 it wasnt that they were asking me to make a film in the sudan orc something barcelona is a great city
1957384 then i started to play around with it and think about it and get some ideas and discard some ideas and finally came up with it
1957385 you reach a certain point where you just simply know and you have great confidence and you have great trust in the actors that you have hired and you dont have to second guess yourself when youre woody allen you know what youre doing obviously its a remarkably non neurotic set but you do have to be prepared
1957386 i felt that i was actually making a foreign film that i was making an american film but basically it was foreign when i look at the film i get a personal pride out of the fact that it looks to me like one of those films that i grew up liking
1957387 i never felt there was ever anything to be rejuvenated from
1957388 i thought that some of the best films i did from my point of view were anything else and hollywood ending
1957389 ive done so many films in new york city that when they see the people walking in central park and eating out at those restaurants and living in those apartments automatically it gives it a feeling of well weve been here before but when they look up and see the streets of london and the london countryside and the spanish countryside theres automatically a freshness that they feel even though the pictures the same
1957390 the only thing that stands between me and greatness is me
1957391 ive made many films and from my first film to my last film ive always had complete 100 percent control over everything no one gets to read the script i cast who i want i write about what i want its a complete carte blanche for me and so i have no one to blame at all when i dont live up to expectations when i do a poor job or a mediocre job or dont make a great film i still feel you know ive never made a film that could stand next to what we consider the great films grand illusion or rashomon or things like that
1957392 ive never thought oh this is the one that if fellini and akira kurosawa and bergman could see this they would just be open mouthed
1957393 i never have that feeling its usually the cold shower feeling i look at it and think oh god what did i do
1957394 and once in a while i get a better feeling
1957395 i saw it and i thought well its close to what i set out to make
1957396 what still surprises me in the movie business is the enormous enthusiasm and enjoyment people get out of unmitigated garbage
1957397 in life what surprises me is that there are any decent people given how terrifying and difficult it is how people cope with it at all
1957398 im very surprised that there are people that actually affirm it

1957401 this is what i call gods security strategy because its all laid out in the old and new testaments of loving our neighbors as ourselves and living as if everyone matters
1957402 through diplomacy you have forums to work out problems so then if you still have a military defense it really is as a last resort
1957403 do americans know that they have made the situation worse
1957404 there was no al qaeda here before the war and now our cities are full of terrorists
1957405 why would they focus on hunting down the terrorists rather than building the security its a backwards strategy it only helps the insurgents in their recruitment
1957406 security doesnt land in a helicopter it grows from the ground up
1957407 you can overthrow somebody with military might but you cant build something
1957408 so that awareness in washington gives me hope that a number of people are saying that
1957409 jam s leer uno de estos libros no me interesan en absoluto
1957410 to put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals to keep tributaries pliant and protected and to keep the barbarians from coming together
1957411 moreover as america becomes an increasingly multi cultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat
1957412 we also need education for citizens to be more efficient in their democracies in addition to education for politicians that will create a new network of elites based upon character and social intelligence
1957413 i encouraged the chinese to support pol pot was an abomination we could never support him but china could
1957414 americas emergence as the sole global superpower now makes an integrated and comprehensive strategy for eurasia imperative eurasia is home to most of the worlds politically assertive and dynamic states all the historical pretenders to global power originated in eurasia the worlds most populous aspirants to regional hegemony china and india are in eurasia as are all the potential political or economic challengers to american primacy eurasia accounts for 75 percent of the worlds population 60 percent of its gnp and 75 percent of its energy resources collectively eurasias potential power overshadows even americas eurasia is the worlds axial supercontinent a power that dominated eurasia would exercise decisive influence over two of the worlds three most economically productive regions western europe and east asia a glance at the map also suggests that a country dominant in eurasia would almost automatically control the middle east and africa with eurasia now serving as the decisive geopolitical chessboard it no longer suffices to fashion one policy for europe and another for asia what happens with the distribution of power on the eurasian landmass will be of decisive importance to americas global primacy and historical legacy
1957415 that no state or combination of states gains the ability to expel the united states or even diminish its decisive role
1957416 given russias size and diversity a decentralized political system and free market economics would be most likely to unleash the creative potential of the russian people and russias vast natural resources a loosely confederated russia composed of a european russia a siberian republic and a far eastern republic would also find it easier to cultivate closer economic relations with its neighbors each of the confederated entitles would be able to tap its local creative potential stifled for centuries by moscows heavy bureaucratic hand in turn a decentralized russia would be less susceptible to imperial mobilization
1957417 u s covert support to the two main chechen rebel groups through pakistans isi was known to the russian government and military however it had previously never been made public or raised at the diplomatic level in november 1999 the russian defense minister igor sergueyev formally accused washington of supporting the chechen rebels following a meeting held behind closed doors with russias military high command sergueyev declared that the national interests of the united states require that the military conflict in the caucasus chechnya be a fire provoked as a result of outside forces
1957418 the wests policy constitutes a challenge launched to russia with the ultimate aim of weakening her international position and of excluding her from geo strategic areas
1957419 the possible emergence of foreign military bases and major military presences in the immediate proximity of russian borders

1957423 region of frozen conflicts is evolving into a functional aggregate on the new border of an enlarging west
1957424 russia test launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile part of a system that can outperform any anti missile system likely to be deployed
1957425 the missile was launched from the tula nuclear powered submarine in the barents sea in the arctic
1957426 the military hardware now on our weapons and those that will appear in the next few years will enable our missiles to outperform any anti missile system including future systems
1957427 a possible launch of a us interceptor missile from central europe may provoke a counterattack from intercontinental ballistic missiles if we suppose that iran wants to strike the united states then interceptor missiles which would be launched from poland will fly towards russia and the shape and flight trajectory are very similar to icbms

1957434 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
1957435 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
1957436 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
1957437 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
1957438 i dont know the key to success but the key to failure is tryin to make everyone else happy

1957449 by exclusively targeting the roma minority this proposal can be unambiguously classified as discriminatory
1957450 by explicitly associating the roma to criminality and by calling for the immediate dismantling of roma camps in the country these officials have created an overall environment of hostility antagonism and stigmatization of the roma community among the general public
1957451 this climate of anti roma sentiment has served to mobilize extremist groups which have recently launched a series of attacks against roma camps and individuals

1957477 the nineteenth century held one last great surprise for chemists

1957479 radiation of course went on and on literally and in ways nobody expected
1957480 marie curie spent the rest of her life working with distinction in the field though she was never elected to the academy of sciences in large part because after the death of pierre she conducted an affair with a married physicist that was sufficiently indiscreet to scandalize even the french or at least the old men who ran the academy which is perhaps another matter
1957481 for a long time it was assumed that anything so miraculously energetic as radioactivity must be beneficial for years manufacturers of toothpaste and laxatives put radioactive thorium in their products and at least until the late 1920s the glen springs hotel in the finger lakes region of new york and doubtless others as well featured with pride the therapeutic effects of its radioactive mineral springs radioactivity wasnt banned in consumer products until 1938 by this time it was much too late for madame curie who died of leukemia in 1934 radiation in fact is so pernicious and long lasting that even now her papers from the 1890s even her cookbooks are too dangerous to handle her lab books are kept in leadlined boxes and those who wish to see them must don protective clothing

1957485 mr key performed at least seventy raids on the homes of iraqi citizens ostensibly looking for weapons none of them was pleasant in the blackness of night doors blown in homes ransacked personal effects looted residents violently roused from their beds and forced outdoors by heavily armed and uniformed soldiers hollering in a foreign language muslim women shamed by their exposed bodies boys too tall for their age and men cuffed and hauled away for interrogation in their nightclothes regardless of weather conditions never at least as far as mr key could ascertain to return
1957486 in my view the board erred in its interpretation of article 171 of the unhcr handbook by concluding that refugee protection for military deserters and evaders is only available where the conduct objected to amounts to a war crime a crime against peace or a crime against humanity

1957533 they believe the same as we do they must be christians
1957534 the temporal death of the fall is replaced by the state of immortality which comes because of the atonement and resurrection of our lord
1957535 all men are redeemed because the death of christ bringeth to pass a resurrection which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep 62 63
1957536 because of the atonement and by obedience to gospel law men have power to become the sons of god in that they are spiritually begotten of god and adopted as members of his family
1957537 but to offer sacrifice as the expression of a repentant and trustful heart is to find atonement elwell 113
1957538 mormons teach that there is both general salvation and individual salvation

1957543 the findings are stunning they clearly show that when teachers fully integrate interactive whiteboards and they make best use of their functionality pupils really do benefit
1957544 a consistent finding across all data was that the length of time pupils have been taught with an iwb is a major factor that leads to attainment gains
1957545 socio economic group is a significant factor in student attainment which remains a core challenge the evidence around low attaining boys in the study however suggests clearly that use of interactive technology improves the performance of less engaged pupils
1957546 too much focus on whole class teaching was shown to be not true with many examples of small group activity and individual and one to one work being found interactive technology clearly does increase the interaction between pupils and teachers with more questioning time amp longer pupil answers this is not just a didactic technology
1957547 schools can explore this particular type of technology without risk of failure
1957548 this study clearly shows the benefits that can be gained from effective use of an interactive whiteboard we know that technology has the capability of bringing lessons to life and making that much more enjoyable for the learner not only do the lessons become more fun the study clearly shows the very real benefits in terms of learner attainment and engaging pupils in lessons
1957549 teacher workload is a major factor sharing of resources and ideas will have great impact over time

1957555 the multi pen board from promethean is an amazing beauty we have yet to fully appreciate and understand to me the london study into interactive whiteboards highlighted how teachers who had not got the benefit of strong professional development support could misuse the immense potential of an interactive whiteboard examples of this included bringing single students up to work through questions and slowing down the flow of the lesson i think this promethean development will literally change everything collaborative shared use of the board cannot be avoided students walking into a promethean activclassroom will instantly know they can expect more than an instructivist experience
1957556 the huge success of promethean planet is because the intrinsic value of the activboard is fully understood by educators the teachers recognise the potential of the solution to change the outputs of their their teaching to such a degree that they are prepared to help drive the community to evolve itself to maximise it this is unprecedented with any other learning technology that schools are embracing teachers are doing this because they feel the activboard has the promise of doing extraordinary things in the classroom and in light of that teachers are prepared to do extraordinary things to celebrate and share this they know their contribution will help another educator do something extraordinary
1957557 one thing that has struck me in reading the research reports is that there is at least 30 different kinds of uses of interactive whiteboards while many of them are highly productive academically some are only mildly productive and some potentially damaging what i think is missing as far as i can tell is that no one has made a ranked list of board uses based on expected student outcomes for example one use of the board is that the teacher can create a graphic representation of something at the board in moments compared with using a chalkboard each time this skill is applied time is saved time is a measurable and valuable commodity in a busy classroom if you are just using the board to help slower student work our problems then the board has little if any advantage over a chalkboard

1957588 legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience

1957754 la malattia di erode diventava sempre pi dolorosa perch dio gli faceva scontare la pena dei suoi crimini
1957755 poi il male si diffuse in tutto il suo corpo facendogli provare sofferenze di ogni genere
1957756 ma erode lottando contro cos grandi sofferenze si attaccava alla vita conservava la speranza e cercava rimedi pass dunque il giordano e fece uso delle acque termali di calliro queste defluiscono nel lago asfaltite e il loro sapore gradevole le rende potabili

1957764 ok heres what you do probably start by cooking the bacon if you are using a really lean meat like lean ground beef you always add the raw meat to the pasta sauce after the onions and garlic are mostly cooked then cook it all together but you dont want your sauce full of bacon grease you want the bacon to be in small pieces probably best to cut it up before cooking it ideally you find bacon cubes from the store instead of strips but i havent seen that in the states yet cook the bacon drain off grease set the bacon aside chop onion and garlic i usually use half an onion for 2 people plus maybe two cloves of garlic you could also include bell peppers very tasty or other vegetables or spicy indian peppers or things boil enough pasta over medium heat put enough olive oil in a large ish frying pan to cover the bottom plus a bit more add onion garlic peppers and whatever else you are putting in cook until onions are browned add bacon add more olive oil the italians do it add pepper and salt to taste add basil and oregano probably add a lot taste it though the longer you leave all this simmering the more the taste of the herbs blends together and the more wonderful the end creation tastes mix the pasta cooked to perfection al dente of course literally meaning at the tooth really meaning not soggy still a little bit hard but more than edible into everything else that is in your frying pan mix it all really well if it seems to dry add more olive oil think of it like a vinegar and oil dressing you want it to all be covered but you dont really want it to be pasta in oil soup but use a lot of olive oil just before serving mix in feta cheese more is better than less because it tastes good perfecto it is good served with salad and bread if you arent too olive oiled out you could serve fancy european bread with bowls of olive oil mixed with basil and oregano like they do at fancy italian restaurants if this doesnt make any sense just call me i dont think i forgot any important steps from the kitchen of gregorio

1957772 stoics based their life on virtue and these acts contribute to a better life stoicism was found be zeno of citium and he his philosophy had three core elements logic physics and ethics to zeno logic referred to things like grammar and consciousness and perception of the world physics was not only about science but also largely about god zeno believed that he universe we live in is god himself zeno believed that ethics was the only goal to aim for in life like the cynics zeno believed that good actions lead to virtue
1957773 nihilism rejects claims to knowledge and truth and explores the meaning of an
1957774 the meaning of life has such a fine line to how you can go across answering it its so vague that when philosophers try to answer the question they ask more questions that never are the same people have so many different views as to life or just the objects that in life then people ask the question whats the meaning for everything and then people ask whats the purpose now when i though about those two points i discovered that those are completely different and you cant really think about them in the same context the thought of the meaning is more along the lines of what the object in life is trying to get what are they reaching for but the thought of whats the purpose is clearly in direct asking of what is the object there for what does it server in benefiting or destroying the life of other objects around it
1957775 i have always thought that the meaning of life threw art was a powerful thought the reason that i thought that it was such a powerful thought was because it was a way of portraying what a person thinks on a certain subject with a hidden message

1957786 le statistiche sulle morti sul lavoro che periodicamente ci vengono trasmesse sono fasulle infatti soltanto in italia esiste il paradosso per il quale si contano come morti sul lavoro al fine di poter dare benefici assicurativi da parte dellinail anche le morti che avvengono per incidenti stradali capitati mentre si va al lavoro o mentre si torna a casa dopo il lavoro morti che evidentemente nulla hanno a che vedere con la sicurezza in fabbrica con ci non si vuole assolutamente sottovalutare il problema anzi occorre impegnarsi sempre di pi tuttavia credo che un po di verit faccia bene a tutti il momento di smetterla di criminalizzare gli imprenditori italiani se infatti estrapoliamo gli incidenti che avvengono in agricoltura e in edilizia vedremo che in italia la sicurezza delle aziende manifatturiere ai migliori livelli europei

1957790 by the new covenant not the new covenant absolutely and originally as given in the first promise is intended but in its complete gospel administration when it was actually established by the death of christ as administered in and by the ordinances of the new testament this with the covenant of sinai were as most say but different administrations of the same covenant
1957791 whether two distinct covenants or only a twofold administration of the same covenant be intended by heb
1957792 the judgment of most reformed divines is that the church under the old testament had the same promise of christ the same interest in him by faith remission of sins and whereas the essence and the substance of the covenant consists in these things they are not to be said to be under another covenant but only a different administration of it but this was so different from that which is established in the gospel after the coming of christ that it hath the appearance and name of another covenant

1957798 the choice of a pro abortion catholic for vice president would deal a major blow to any efforts by the obama campaign to reach out to catholic voters
1957799 both the bishops and the laity continue to wrestle with the scandal of prominent catholic politicians who support abortion and the choice of a pro abortion catholic running mate would amount to scratching at a deep and festering wound in the american catholic church
1957800 given his position ion everyone expects to select a pro abortion vice presidential candidate
1957801 in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
1957802 chinas coercive population control program has imposed unspeakable violence pain and humiliation on hundreds of millions of chinese women many of whom suffer lifelong depression as a consequence
1957803 if you think you know how the catholic church in the united states wants its members to vote in the presidential election this year think again
1957804 single issue voting like simply choosing the anti abortion candidate is out
1957805 to understand that support for legal abortion is enough to disqualify a candidate from consideration for public office one doesnt need a bishops document or an argument about the nuances of catholic teaching

1957809 seculars want temple as fast of av begins saturday night
1957810 the zionist occupation has not yet agreed to the demand to release our prisoners so our fighters are preparing for the next round in which we will try to abduct more israeli soldiers to swap them for our hero prisoners
1957811 it began when we were sent to bdolach to help pack up the nursery school
1957812 suddenly she asked me do you know what they are planning to do with us or where theyre planning to take us
1957813 three years is not a short time and things should have straightened out already
1957814 we entered kfar darom this was the first time i was in gush katif i saw that it looked just like a kibbutz large lawns very nice one floor houses i had always thought that settlers meant caravans and poverty but suddenly i saw how beautiful the place was
1957815 we got to the houses of the families and then it became very very hard
1957816 at one point his father and brother said they refused to let any soldiers come into their house and that they would take the boy out by themselves
1957817 there was an ethiopian family that we moved out it really broke my heart i remember that there even i cried the father kept on giving his little daughter candies to give to us the people who came to take them out just so she wouldnt be afraid of us he asked to speak with all of us and explained that ever since he arrived from ethiopia by foot in operation solomon in 1991 he has been wandering in israel among different caravan neighborhoods and only here in kfar darom did he finally succeed in building his house he asked us not to take him out forcefully as he wanted to go out by himself he took his little daughter in his hands and his suitcase and when he reached the door he just broke down in tears and crying held on to the doorpost and simply refused to part where is he today did he ever recover from what we did to him did he end up wandering again among caravans i dont know but that moment was shocking it it something that you remember every day something you get up with in the morning if you ignore it and leave it aside everything is fine but when you really think about it and the pictures return it is shocking its alive and kicking and painful and burning
1957818 i hope the families and residents will forgive me first of all as a private individual who did this terrible thing and also as a citizen of this country
1957819 i hear much talks about additional evacuations of jewish towns and people and various concessions it seems to me that everyone can see what is happening in the place that we evacuated i remember that the chairman of my youth movement spoke to us during a seminar in preparation for the disengagement and said we are not happy at their misfortune we want to do something good if it turns out to be not good we will be strong enough to admit that we failed well i never heard that he asked forgiveness but if we have to be strong enough to admit that we failed then i feel that this move was a failure it was a wrong move
1957820 how could i a little girl who never built a thing in her life have dared to come and destory with my own hands entire lives of people who built up so much with such hard work
1957821 it took me a long time to reach the point where i feel i have to say im sorry without trying to look for explanations as far as im concerned there is no explanation for what happened in gush katif and i simply regret it very much im not getting into an ideological argument but from my emotional experience i feel that i was part of a terrible injustice that was done to these people an injustice that looking backwards was not necessary in my opinion and with no real positive results only negative ones
1957822 because i want to ask true fogiveness from the families and to strengthen them but i hope that other soldiers will also follow me and will do the same i know that no one can say we did a beautiful job in the disengagement because everyone was broken from it
1957823 were not yet in our permanent homes we have not yet reached our rest and inheritance to come and say to us were sorry without doing something to repair what they did has no meaning the soldiers who feel bad about what they do have to tell their commanders in that well oiled machine that they will not take part in another expulsion and they must go the people they threw out of their homes and see what they can do for them and they must educate their future children not to take part in something like this
1957824 but rather a national correction that must be made the nation of israel has to know that if someone destroyed an area in the land of israel it doesnt get solved just by saying sorry when it comes to the destruction of the land of israel there is no forgiveness
1957825 seculars want temple as fast of av begins saturday night
1957826 its true that we dont exactly represent a majority of secular kibbutz members but the pioneers have always been a minority the zionists were a minority among the jews those who came to the land were a minority among the zionists those who worked the land were also a minority and now we are a minority as well but i hope that soon we will be the leaders
1957827 well the word religious can be the subject of long discussions look the gerrer rebbe once said when the haskalah enlightenment came to the world with science physics etc we the religious left it for the secular jews when zionism came to the world we gave that too to the secular and now we have also left the repentance movement for the secular accordingly it looks like we the secular will also have to build the beit hamikdash
1957828 there are many religious authorities including maimonides who say that the temple must be rebuilt and so i think it should be done as a first step we must show that we control the temple mount i call upon all of israel to come to the mount on tisha bav and show that it belongs to the jewish nation
1957829 every year the us state department publishes a report on the state of human rights and religious freedom in israel to our great sorrow you repeatedly every year report baseless claims regarding yad lachim you write that yad lachim harasses missionaries and uses violence against them these unfounded claims have no basis and are essentially nothing more than slander
1957830 we fear that the information you have published comes from interested parties among the missionary organizations and that you are giving them a stage for their libels without verifying the claims
1957831 whats outrageous is that instead of the state department contacting us for some kind of clarification they just printed it
1957832 if anything its the opposite its the missionaries who have been violent against us against our yad lachim activists and not the other way around
1957833 theres no significance on a practical level at this stage but were concerned weve been asked to come to america and set up shop there to help american jews fight missionaries were concerned that if the state department has us down as troublemakers they might get in the way of allowing us to set up operations there
1957834 the missionaries in israel are in a bind because theyre getting a massive amount of money from their supporters in america and around the world and they dont have much to show for it theyre working very very hard and yad lachim is succeeding every week in rescuing jews from their missions and they need an excuse if they can accuse us of violence thats the excuse that they need
1957835 destroying this monster facility or putting it out of action at this point will mean heavy casualties
1957836 a mighty conflagration occurred in the olive press in the seventh century ce remains of the blaze which are quite evident on the walls of the building destroyed the structure and negated the installations use
1957837 which character in little house on the prairie are you most like
1957838 youre beyond quirky youre downright bizarre youve lost touch with social norms and whats appropriate and youre loving every minute of it
1957839 it is better for all the world if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind
1957840 whereas the hereditarily healthy families have for the most part adopted a policy of having only one or two children countless numbers of inferiors and those suffering from hereditary conditions are reproducing unrestrainedly while their sick and asocial offspring burden the community
1957841 in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetents society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind
1957842 id grown up fearing the lynch mobs of the ku klux klan as an adult i was starting to wonder if id been afraid of the wrong white people all along where i was being pursued not by bigots in white robes but

1958143 that her family was one of the ones especially struck by the falling
1958144 shes rather distraught to be working under lauries killer according to our communication logs shes called home ten times in three days i can only assume seeking guidance
1958145 set her up with ships counselor then make sure she goes get the doctor to pull medical rank if she needs to
1958146 actually i havent been to the medical bay yet i think ill go see the prestigious dr yeriindehl
1958147 the feeling is mutual dr yeriindehl may lieutenant renolds and i come in
1958148 you have come for a reasssson c c c captain harold i am verrrry bussssy
1958149 just a minor matter doctor theres an ensign alexandria smith do you know her
1958150 sssshe isssss the navigator of thissss vessssel what isss wrong with her
1958151 well nothing severe except that she has found herself faced by the person blamed for killing her savior she was evidently affected by the falling you know it i assume
1958152 sir i dont think just assigning a counselor is going to solve this
1958153 her problem isnt with society her problem is with you her problem is not internalized its with you
1958154 sir im worried about ships operations i dont worry about people
1958155 thank you sir i know this is the right choice of action for
1958156 welcome to the sirius system i trust that all has been well
1958157 your shower tried to kill me but aside from that alls been well yourself
1958158 captain harold the purpose of this briefing is to bring you up to date on the present situation of the grf and on your new orders since since you are being reinstated despite your actions you have been cleared the uen has decided the situation was justified
1958159 he was ineffective the new president is better who is the new president anyway
1958160 he was good at what he did good for him
1958161 their primary weakness in the past has been the lack of individual creativity and free thinking abilities meaning weve always been able to deal with them by dealing with their primary hivemind they have learned how to adapt to the loss of a hivemind they can fight effectively without the hivemind and now between that and they are more lets say helpful allies their numerical advantages are shining through
1958162 the korril have lived on the fringe of the galaxy for centuries as a silent and reclusive empire though extremely advanced it is presently 2559 there have only been three attempts to contact them the first was in 2188 with a small group of mallain scouting ships a korril ship arrived and ordered them to turn back or face certain destruction that was in their last report we never received another one
1958163 the second was in 2355 an armed uen task force that arrived in a different portion of their space as we had no idea what their territories were at the time
1958164 when admiral polks fleet was forced to attempt to take refuge there the korril refused and polks fleet was forced to retreat back into xoraxi territory only a handful survived polk included fortunately
1958165 the entire mallain homeworld was evacuated in time and the civilians have relocated to a world in this sector with similar atmospheric and geological conditions
1958166 is it wise to relocate them so close to the front after they just lost their homeworld
1958167 as i said weve realized that your actions warranted the death of president laurie we had a hearing for you in absentia and after testimony from both admiral keldan and the various diplomats and other officers on both side of the situation we had no chance of getting him back from the xoraxi even if you had not destroyed the ship and the loss of hivemind jialris was definitely worth it you were cleared of all charges and if wed freed you earlier you likely wouldve returned to your old command
1958168 well thats nice to hear why then havent your damned soldiers stopped being pissy towards me
1958169 laurie was a popular man harold even if the justice system decided his death was a justifiable sacrifice most of us do not there were more than one appeals to that ruling i can tell you that not all of them from military members i remember one old lady from earth tried to appeal the ruling without a lawyer
1958170 excellent you will be commanding an a f22493 destructor dreadnought the intrepid it is a new ship just off the shipyards of the station it passed its inspections earlier this morning
1958171 all of the items on your quarter have been teleported on board the captains quarters of the intrepid you will be teleported over in thirty minutes
1958172 thirty minutes not much time to get used to being back eh
1958173 this is correct you will be introduced to your crew and do not worry all of them have been highly trained to be objective towards you especially in the field of battle they may not like you but you wont see that when theyre on duty
1958174 good luck captain harold you have twenty seven minutes until you are due to be teleported stay safe out there
1958175 my name is henry renolds ill be your tactical officer welcome to the intrepid
1958176 nice to meet you lieutenant renolds shall we head to the bridge
1958177 how have you enjoyed being back in civilization captain harold
1958178 i suppose ill be better once ive atoned for betelgeuse
1958179 if nothing else i can assure you i wont be to hung up about that i was still at the uen academy at the time of the battle of betelgeuse but ive read about jialris naturally i regret lauries death but i feel the death of such a tactical genius as jialris makes up for his demise especially considering that laurie popular though he was was not a wartime president president vladimyr has been far more effective
1958180 are you always so detached and calculating about death or just as far as other peoples deaths go
1958181 death is something we all have to expect if it were i on board jialriss ship and not president laurie i still wouldve told you to open fire we have to win
1958182 well i know how you got in i meant why
1958183 i hope to become captain of my own ship one day though hopefully one larger than the answer it was just a nexus you know space born artillery hardly a worthy command for someone of my fathers talents
1958184 but i can assure you i had nothing but respect for nexus operators theyre solid men most of them operating the most bizarre and difficult ships we have it may not be a glorious command but i can assure you its an important one
1958185 but he was worthy of at least a dominator battlecruiser
1958186 my name is captain james harold as you all know
1958187 while i realize that some of you may be upset over my actions four years ago and i assure you i understand ill ask that you not let that get in your way of following my orders to the letter i have been cleared of those charges and im trying to put it behind me i would hope youd all follow suit
1958188 now all of you know my name and probably know quite a bit about me by reputation id enjoy some introductions renolds here i already know the rest of you
1958189 is ensign riialru atul she will be commanding your sensors
1958190 captain i am rendahl i will be your second for this journey i can only assume you have already met renolds riialru and kaltari though they are not on the bridge at this time the human alexandria smith shall command your communication station a member of the neryll race who has volunteered to serve your human navy shall maintain our engines and other systems he is vol both shall serve you with distinction and honor
1958191 rendahl i do not believe i will be needed on the bridge at this time the bridge is yours i shall be in my quarters please inform me if i am required or when we are prepared to depart
1958192 we have taken your president laurie he is ours we shall negotiate his release in return for our lives power down your weapons and we shall negotiate peacefully
1958193 they have the damn president of the une weve confirmed it thats where his shuttle vanished too his ship now his shields are already down so all ships power down your
1958194 sir its a trap hes going to kill the president and then his reinforcements are going to show up and hes going to kill us too
1958195 damn it harold hes the president and you have your orders power down your damn weapons
1958196 sir thats where the president is you heard the admiral
1958197 damn right i heard him but hes wrong jialris is the best damn hivemind theyve got the president is going to die no matter what and im not going down with them target his ship
1958198 captain we cant kill the president its simply not allowed
1958199 im glad you resisted renear it means none of you will be blamed for this
1958200 attention fleet the darkstar and its crew have committed grand treason against the galactic resistance force open fire
1958201 sir my crew had nothing to do with this my actions were my own i transferred all control to my chair and locked them out
1958202 crew i disagree with keldan but i also disagree with the captain
1958203 you are needed on the bridge we are prepared to leave
1958204 but im not your captain im a prisoner arent i
1958205 captain this is commander rendahl are you aware of where you are
1958206 er yes rendahl i know where i am i mustve fallen asleep there ill be right there
1958207 so youre a bridge member im alexandria smith the communications officer i just got here what station do you run
1958208 i was cleared of all charges thank you very much but yes for a time i was wanted for treason
1958209 and the greatest hivemind weve faced under the xoraxi since the legendary yitripdan yes
1958210 plannin on killin anymore elected officials on this trip or are you done for the year
1958211 regrettable though lauries death was it was a necessary sacrifice
1958212 i have checked the roster and inventory myself we are prepared for departure once we have received clearance
1958213 excellent ensign smith open a channel to sirius primes fleet station
1958214 sirius operations this is captain james harold of the uen intrepid requesting clearance for departure
1958215 i see youre cleared for departure and logged feel free to leave at your convenience good luck out there intrepid
1958216 ensign urub feel free to take us out full speed ahead
1958217 everyone im going down to engineering to acquaint myself with the staff rendahl the bridge is yours
1958218 yes human there is work to be done and yet none what do you require
1958219 we are in your species limited vocal capacity known as vol what do you require from our staff
1958220 i was just hoping to get to know you all considering ill be working with you
1958221 we have not all noticed you yet captain we are apologetic
1958222 apology not necessary vol are all systems working as intended
1958223 we are pleased with our systems checks thus far human all seems well with our engines weapons and shields as well as all other non critical systems such as your inferior molecular constructors and teleporters we shall continue watching to ensure they stay well
1958224 thatd be me yes to what do i owe this honor
1958225 if youre bringing me back to earth to face trial id much rather stay here and get extra food from the xoraxi for being a good cooperative prisoner
1958226 though id much like to considering what you did no were here to ask that you reinstate your commission in return for full amnesty
1958227 the uen charter pretty much denies any possible contact with committers of capital treason
1958228 if i had the choice id shoot you right now unfortunately the uen is getting desperate and you were one of the best captains we had before your incarceration this entire operation was set up to get you out and if you dont mind were on a very tight schedule
1958229 captain we cant risk you being shot if you die this entire operation is wasted get out the door head for the closest shuttle
1958230 you seemed to be rather deep in your thoughts serg thought you were thinking we were taking you to a grf prison
1958231 no i was just worried about what mightve become of my crew after the battle of betelgeuse its not like they were handed a medal for that
1958232 actually thats exactly what happened renear was given a commendation for his damage control attempts after you activated the teleporter sent yourself onto the escape pod and fled hes the captain of the darkstar now
1958233 its like if youre a couple you cease to have your own identity you become this monstrous mutant blob thing
1958234 its not even accurate if theyre going to refer to us as a unit where are the kids
1958235 wherever you want to sell them is fine with me
1958236 we need to prepare tomorrows leaders to tackle environmental issues
1958237 im pleased that the government is acting immediately on our groups recommendations
1958238 ontario is taking important steps to help more students understand that their local actions affect the global community today and for generations to come
1958239 it is vital to the future of our great province that our next generation of community leaders and global citizens has a strong understanding of the environment climate change and the importance of conservation
1958240 students teachers our community and our planet will benefit from these changes that this government is making to the ontario curriculum
1958241 we are growing a new generation of environmental leaders in our schools
1958242 im freakin out man this book is freakin me out
1958243 he wondered if she were turning queer women did he knew zeena who had at her fingers end the pathological chart of the whole region had cited many cases of the kind when she nursed his mother and he himself knew of certain lonely farm houses in the neighborhood where stricken creatures pined and of others where sudden tragedy had come of their presence at times looking at zeenas shut face he felt the chill of such forebodings
1958244 within a year of their marriage she developed the sickliness which had since made her notable even in a community rich in pathological instances when she came to take care of his mother she had seemed to ethan like the very genius of health but he soon saw that her skill as a nurse had been acquired by the absorbed observation of her own symptoms

1958246 how many more have a problem with drugs who didnt enter treatment
1958247 the only bad thing about this beer is that its so good and they start selling it early so you drink too much of it and get tired of it before the end of summer
1958248 we were treated very even handedly we were fed and watered and apart from some tough questioning it was okay
1958249 it was nothing compared to the treatment a tibetan or even a chinese citizen would face if they undertook a similar protest
1958250 they were keen to get us out of the country and i was keen to get home
1958251 im happy that we have managed to shine a spotlight on the brutal crackdown in tibet and chinas attempts to whitewash their human rights record but there is still a lot more to achieve
1958252 teens are getting the message about the harms of marijuana and are changing their behavior for the better
1958253 however youth abuse of prescription drugs remains a troubling concern with prescription drug abuse were confronting a different kind of drug threat one that lurks not in dark alleys but in medicine cabinets within our homes parents have been vital to reducing teen use of street drugs and now they must engage to prevent the abuse of prescription drugs
1958254 everyday we encounter mass media so much we dont know were doing it
1958255 the prisoner would feel the guards gaze upon them an regulate their behavior accordingly
1958256 e by means of pressing the seventh button on the left when this is permissible
1958257 hence we can say something about what goes wrong when someone in good conscience does wrong or at least does wrong in this way she fails to achieve what she was trying to achieve
1958258 modern day china has felt it right to militarily and politically force taiwan in to submission under chinas own definition of a separate countrys nationhood or supposed lack thereof

1958714 it the device knows whats in the area and what channels to use and picks out the best channel from our point of view geolocation has to be part of the solution
1958715 absolute solid interference protection the device knew what to avoid
1958716 these devices could knock out wireless communications systems like headsets used by coaches and officials microphones used by referees to announce penalties and calls and microphones used by journalists to conduct interviews with athletes and coaches
1958717 its really ideal spectrum for rural broadband and we see uses in land mobile applications
1958718 we view white spaces as somewhat similar to wi fi when it was first approved for use no one knew all the applications devices and form factors that would evolve
1958719 nab has no quarrel with field tests but based upon multiple failures of unlicensed devices in laboratory testing thus far we remain highly skeptical that this technology will ever work as advertised
1958720 presumably somewhere down the line there will be technology that develops that potentially could use white spaces without interference so we have to be open to that potential and look at what is the appropriate policy
1958721 its certainly our goal to raise problems or issues prior to the trademark being published and a notice of allowance being issued
1958722 what happened in terms of market share was that intel and via grew and amd did not
1958723 the math basically forces the market share to go to the players that grew normally you dont see q2 as a growth quarter typically the second quarter is flat growth or slightly down both intel and via took advantage of this expansion in the bottom end of the market with the intel atom and the via c7
1958724 we believe actual netbook demand has been stronger than expected limited by intel processor availability and within this intel has only seen limited competition via only
1958725 companies need to make their own mind up as to whether they want to allow their users to access web sites like facebook and myspace during office hours
1958726 if workers are allowed to be given access to these sites then its vital that they do not put their personal and corporate data at risk and are protected from web based infections
1958727 nbcs strategy is based on an end to end cisco architecture built on top of cisco routers and video encoding systems as well as our wan wide area network acceleration technology the cisco waas
1958728 this uses some key innovations the first and most important is a single unified network fabric built around the cisco 12000 router its a 450m bps network combining real time high definition broadcast contribution video voice and data from the points of creation into the studios in new york and los angeles
1958729 nbcs custom designed application tracks and documents literally millions of assets down to the individual camera and production equipment piece to coordinate all of the production and logistics around many events
1958730 it has to run flawlessly across various intercontinental links from china to several points in north america
1958731 this requires making low res copies of thousands of hours of competitions that are captured in our storage system in beijing and using a product called procast a video acceleration management product that proxies the images over to another media grid storage server in new york
1958732 we also have 40 at home editors we call them shot pickers using a vpn to either new york or la who make their shot selections using the proxies once they decide which shots they want to make a deliverable piece with then the system sends the proxies back to beijing to nbcs data center headquarters where the high res clips are called up from the main arrays to match the low res mpg4 proxies that have been selected
1958733 wed clog up the cisco data pipes between the at home editors new york and beijing if we didnt use proxies
1958734 theres an educational component where you can come in plug in and theyll tell you whats going on
1958735 theyll give you tools for sniffing teach you how to monitor the network how to look for your computer leaking stuff

1958756 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
1958757 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it

1958771 satu2nya jalan merubah islam adalah membuang quran 90 isi quran harus dibuang kau juga harus membuang sejarah islam dan menyangkal mutlak isi sirat
1958772 di dunia barat orang bertanya apakah islam bisa mengalami reformasi seperti yang dialami kristen ini sungguh perbandingan yang salah
1958773 dalam kristen bukan agamanya yang harus diubah tapi gerejanya hal ini karena ajaran yesus itu sendiri adalah baik
1958774 dalam islam bukannya masyarakat muslimnya yang jelek tapi justru agamanya
1958775 orang2 berusaha menyingkirkanku dengan menghinaku melalui berbagai cara mereka tuduh aku yahudi kristen hindu orang mencoba berbagai cara utk mendiskreditkan diriku
1958776 memang benar bahwa ada satu milyar orang yg percaya pada islam tapi kebenaran tetap kebenaran orang2 bisa melihat hal itu percayalah tidak ada jawaban lain kita akan membayar harga yang sangat besar kecuali kita menyadari bahwa jalan keluarnya adalah menyingkirkan islam menunjukkan pada muslim bahwa agama mereka bukan berasal dari tuhan tapi dari muhammad seorang penipu dan pendusta
1958777 aku yakin bahwa dengan berjalannya waktu aku akan meyakinkan jutaan dan jutaan muslim dan dengan begitu dasar fondasi islam akan runtuh
1958778 di iran forumku ini dilarang juga di berbagai tempat di pakistan daftarnya panjang
1958779 jika aku tidak sukses seperti ini dalam meyakinkan orang maka tentunya aku tidak akan seyakin ini tapi aku lihat bahwa kebenaran memang nyata sekarang banyak sekali orang yang menulis padaku dan membuat film di youtube
1958780 beginilah cara memerangi kejahatan aku tidak mau membunuh musuh aku ingin memenangkan hati mereka sehingga mereka menjadi teman2 dan sekutuku inilah kemenangan sejati dengan cara begini kita menang karena kita memusnahkan musuh kita yakni ketidaktahuan dan rasa benci dalam diri muslim inilah sebabnya aku percaya pada perjuanganku inilah sebabnya aku yakin bahwa diriku adalah alat perdamaian

1958788 we must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people
1958789 i want to get the job done weve identified a problem lets go solve it together
1958790 our emissions are up 33 per cent above kyoto levels and the u s is only up 18 per cent so i dont think were going to get anywhere by lecturing or passing judgment
1958791 you were left looking for a little more here something that would make other countries sit up and take notice and say something is happening here
1958792 he has disappointed before i cant say he hasnt done it again
1958793 despite a few hopeful signs that he had changed his mind the president stuck with the shrinking group of climate change dead enders who are still fighting against a new binding treaty
1958794 why stephen harper is giving cover to a discredited administration is beyond me he is using canadas good name to try to lend some legitimacy to a process which has none
1958795 its absurd to propose to further subsidize electricity which will encourage increased consumption which means your promise to close the coal plants will be impossible and just as empty as dalton mcguintys promise in 2003
1958796 if industries businesses and even household consumers are paying these gargantuan bills they have no money to invest in energy efficiency
1958797 simply driving up hydro rates will mean you have seniors on a pension who cant pay their bill people on a fixed income who cant pay their bills and youll have hundreds of thousands of people out of work
1958798 if electricity is cheaper companies will use more electricity they will automate more and they will not need to hire as many people
1958799 if companies pay they real cost for electricity then there will be more employment and less energy consumption
1958800 any time you get into a discussion with young people about climate change and the environment and issues like energy consumption youre going to get a lot of ideas
1958801 this is going to be a good day for safety
1958802 your 50 year old businessmen in suits driving really expensive vehicles sometimes with their families in them
1958803 if a motorist is coming off the 400 series highway at 100 kilometres an hour and hits an 80 zone and then goes through a small town with a 50 zone they will be 50 over the limit and will get their car impounded
1958804 how can private deregulated electricity be cheaper when you add in profits to generators profits to distributors profits to retailers dividends to investors and commissions to commodities brokers
1958805 the opa is only a transitional entity until a mature competitive electricity market can be installed
1958806 evolution of ontarios electricity sector towards a workably competitive market
1958807 will lead to increased competition among suppliers and lower costs
1958808 saying we need nuclear plants to meet base load demand in ontario is like saying you need a mainframe computer to access the internet
1958809 it may have been the case in the past but the next generation energy system will be leaner greener and a lot more flexible
1958810 we looked at other jurisdictions we looked at ontarios potential and our report shows this can be done
1958811 more conservation and efficiency a distributed mix of smaller renewable power sources a smart grid network and power storage technologies could provide a more robust and less costly method of meeting base load in ontario
1958812 dont let people tell you we cant keep the lights on without nuclear
1958813 we have the know how and clean energy potential to build a modern energy system founded on renewable energy
1958814 we are talking about maximizing the full potential of safe clean energy and energy efficiency first
1958815 this is opposite to the opa plan which maximizes nuclear capacity and then low balls the potential for conservation and renewable energy accordingly
1958816 we must in our actions make sure that we uphold the welfare of mammals birds fish insects and other animals uphold the well being of soils and waters and uphold the interests of the diverse varieties of trees and other plants in our forests the extraction of trees whether for pulp sawlogs or christmas trees must uphold such a land ethic
1958817 nonpartisan patriotism is the common thread tying together these reflections love letters and stories of combat they make for riveting reading
1958818 this collection is an excellent introduction to an emerging form of war reporting
1958819 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
1958820 we share the goal of slowing stopping and reversing the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions over the shortest period of time that is reasonably achievable
1958821 its meant to go on the offensive in a positive way as opposed to being in a defensive position where i think the industry has been for the past few years
1958822 unless we pull together and get a degree of consensus in the country canada will continue to be mired in this highly destructive non productive debate that eventually will lead to i dont know maybe draconian regulations that make no sense whatsoever
1958823 growing menace of climate change is one of the most important public policy challenges of our time

1958828 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
1958829 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
1958830 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
1958831 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
1958832 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
1958833 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
1958834 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
1958835 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them
1958836 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
1958837 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
1958838 you looked good inside the lake i thought you were lovin it
1958839 his hopes were so high he was doomed to disappointment
1958840 why do you feel like you need someone to give you an explanation for your disappointments
1958841 this pain and rejection is not what god intended for you to experience in christian community please forgive us for the times when we have failed to act like the community of jesus followers we claim to be

1958846 while this may seem like any standard security hole other researchers say that the work is a major breakthrough and there is very little that microsoft can do to fix the problems
1958847 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
1958848 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
1958849 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
1958850 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
1958851 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
1958852 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
1958853 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force

1958865 the government of sudan tried to convince the people of darfur that the non muslims in the south were our enemies and used us to oppress the southerners

1958880 that leads in my case and i would think in other cases as well that people say well lets just not reinsulate the roof
1958881 we have no problem with the use of solar energy
1958882 marburg is already a leader when it comes to the use of solar energy but up until now theyve always tried to convince people rather than forcing them
1958883 its unfortunate that they decided to compel people because i think you breed opponents that way rather than friends of solar energy
1958884 we have a serious energy problem with the older homes
1958885 before solar installations were the exception and their absence was the rule
1958886 we want to get to the point where the opposite is the case
1958887 what they are doing in marburg is good and progressive and we and other cities need to move forward with similar initiatives as well
1958888 there have been 185 000 telephone intercepts in this operation and there have been 400 members of the afp deployed to this operation

1958973 do you see any left turns on the trail we wouldnt have made it this way less we were positive it was safe it even has a seat belt
1958974 why would you need any its all downhill all you have to do is rest your feet on those nails sticking out you gotta figure that youd like pedaling as much as youd like running let gravity do the work and when you come to the rise at the edge of the canyon youll sail over without any fuss at all
1958975 if it doesnt have any pedals then how do you stop it
1958976 oooohhh good question that its easy as can be really see that handle by the handlebars
1958977 all ya gotta do is pull that stick back and itll put on the brake

1959007 discovery communications held a passive non controlling shareholder interest in meteor studios an independent company incorporated under the quebec companies act
1959008 all matters related to the management of meteor studios its employees and operations have been handled directly by meteor studios principals since the inception of the company
1959009 we had to design this data center for maximum flexibility
1959010 network design is the key for us i really look at that as the foundation of what we do
1959011 my network manager is always telling me he cant do anything about the speed of light
1959012 we have some systems we thought were redundant until they failed
1959013 and so the quest for more computing capacity never ends
1959014 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical
1959015 what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there
1959016 weve had a couple designs that have kind of gone to that outlandish size but it has never gone through to the building

1959022 the systems themselves in my opinion can handle any creative challenge
1959023 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar
1959024 that is going though facial algorithms and going back into the camera as a real time cg face of the character
1959025 you see it talk you see the eyes move it is pretty phenomenal
1959026 once weve laid down a take the take exists in the digital asset management system
1959027 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual we call it director centric because i can use the camera to block the actors
1959028 when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there as the processing power goes up our models get more sophisticated and our lighting tools get more sophisticated even while we are making this movie im still doing a lot of virtual camera work on the film on stuff that was shot six months ago
1959029 we changed the words and he redid the dialogue we didnt have to recapture his body performance and he didnt have to put the performance capture suit on again we were just creating new words and we were creating a new face
1959030 one movie where the aesthetics of physical production and the aesthetics of virtual production are to the extent that we could do it pretty much it identical
1959031 were taking our virtual production toolset and superimposing it on physical production
1959032 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
1959033 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
1959034 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3 d stereoscopic screens most montors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now
1959035 i think back of our shots at titanic lensed for
1959036 when we look at 3 d display devices in the home which are already becoming available a lot of filmmakers and studios need to be making 3 d right now those production commitments are often based on the here and now instead of thinking about how much value there is to this 3 d product in the future why not master in 3 d now if there is only an incremental expense why not think about that now

1959311 weet u wel dat er ook in belgi een partij is die massaal de migranten wil deporteren
1959312 it is important that politics of multicultural citizenship claims the space opened by european integration before new nationalism gains the ground
1959313 integratie van individuen betekent desintegratie van buitenlandse groeperingen dit werkt discriminatie in de hand omdat de groepering als geheel wordt gemarginaliseerd
1959314 er zijn hogere waarden dan staatsgrenzen als in alle vrede en rust een landsdeel autonomie wenst te verkrijgen dan wel binnen een andere staat wil leven moet daarmee rekening worden gehouden 1k zeg niet dat elk dorp dat autonoom wil zijn wens gehonoreerd moet zien anders zou de wereldorde uit elkaar spatten maar men rekening houden met de wil van de burgers

1959325 iemand die ronduit voor zijn standpunten uitkwam en voorvechter was van het vrije woord
1959326 we kunnen deze moord niet anders zien dan als het voorlopige sluitstuk van een jarenlange haatcampagne door de gevestigde politiek vooral gepraktiseerd door zogenaamde politiek correcte lieden van linkse huize tegen de opvattingen van nationaalgezinde oorspronkelijke nederlanders

1959331 wij uit handen hebben gegeven door de bezetting van binnenuit
1959332 we zijn evolutionair gezien een halve eeuw of langer teruggezet
1959333 wij op weg zijn naar transnationale gemeenschappen westerse waarden zouden helemaal niet strijdig zijn met die van andere culturen toenemende sociaal economische ongelijkheid wordt aanvaard wil nederland geen eiland in de wereld worden want die ongelijkheid bij ons mag niet losgezongen worden van internationaal economische verhoudingen men moet multicultureel onderwijs genieten economische migranten moet een bepaalde ingroeiperiode in ons sociale systeem worden vergund minderheden moeten op hun meerwaarde worden aangesproken
1959334 door de mondiale ontwikkelingen anno 2000 te beschouwen als een unieke ongekende situatie komt ruimte om met energie en inzet van oude en nieuwe burgers te werken aan de maatschappij van morgen niet met blind idealisme maar zeker niet met de oogkleppen van regressief nationalisme want die weg leidt onherroepelijk naar een groot oostenrijk
1959335 we hebben niet voor niets al die eeuwen de moslims afgeslagen
1959336 ruimte om met vrijmoedigheid de spanningen die de multi etnische samenleving oproept publiekelijk te bespreken
1959337 nederlandse families voelen zich bedreigd door immigranten die hen overvleugelen ze gaan zich zelf zien als vreemdeling in eigen land en als slachtoffers van ghettos die zij niet cre erden natuurlijk zijn er goede buitenlanders die bijdragen aan de samenleving maar anderen geven niks om onze fundamentele waarden nooit zal het nederlandse rijk multi etnisch worden want we moeten de samenhang in de maatschappij behouden
1959338 een zekere nationale trots om een gemeenschappelijk project tot stand te brengen en eraan een bijdrage te leveren
1959339 want mensen hebben behoefte aan geborgenheid in de ge nternationaliseerde harde wereld van het kapitaal
1959340 dat het tijd wordt van elkaar te leren chinezen weten niet veel over allah sowieso niet over god maar jullie moslims weten niet veel van politiek kijk eens de vsa voeren een wereldwijde oorlog tegen de islam weest nu maar blij dat u onder bescherming van de volksrepubliek woont we gaan bij elkaar op cursus wat voor cursus een cursus politiek bewustzijn is dat nou wel nodig ja want zonder cursus haalt u geen diploma en zonder diploma kunt u geen lid worden van de communistische partij en zonder zon lidmaatschap mag u geen moskee runnen
1959341 vele machthebbers zich niet meer bekommeren om rechtsfilosofische normen de geschiedenis heeft ze niets te vertellen ze beginnen als t ware elke dag opnieuw recht is wat multicultuur bevordert waar ook ter wereld verschil in godsdienst en levensstijl worden niet serieus genomen
1959342 studies van hen die zich reeds vanaf de reformatie en de renaissance bezighielden met het volkenrecht het recht van oorlog en vrede het recht van verzet het recht de onderdrukker te doden enzovoorts als het ware bij het oud papier kwamen te staan

1959346 a participatory notion of spectatorship whose political potential shouldnt be ignored if a viewer is free to draw upon her own reserves of memory as she participates in the creation of the object on screen her private and unofficial histories and memories will be granted as much legitimation as the official histories that make up the realm of the clich if not more

1959526 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1959527 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1959528 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip

1959538 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him

1959592 we do the same with our minorities in the difference is we do it under martial law and you do it under parliamentary democracy
1959593 election year in is always boisterous and you have a very high decibel levels and ultimately i think the electorate always gives a good result right now our economy is doing very well growth rate is 7 per cent plus stock market is very high foreign investments are coming in at a level that was unthinkable seven years ago so i think the economic growth has weathered the political decibels
1959594 we believe that whoever comes into power would have to follow our policies we have a very independent media we have an independent judiciary and we have i think very well informed people
1959595 so any mismanagement of the economy will not be tolerated for the simple reason that the bench marks that have been established in in terms of fiscal management in terms of monetary policy in terms of exchange rate policies would brook no lowering of the bar
1959596 and the level of the growth and the level of the investment if it is not better than before if any government will not be able to maintain it will have a very tough time surviving

1959607 y l os dio vida a vosotros cuando estabais muertos en vuestros delitos y pecados en los cuales anduvisteis en otro tiempo siguiendo la corriente de este mundo conforme al pr ncipe de la potestad del aire el esp ritu que ahora opera en los hijos de desobediencia entre los cuales tambi n todos nosotros vivimos en otro tiempo en los deseos de nuestra carne haciendo la voluntad de la carne y de los pensamientos y ramos por naturaleza hijos de ira lo mismo que los dem s
1959608 mudar el et ope su piel y el leopardo sus manchas as tambi n podr is vosotros hacer bien estando habituados a hacer mal
1959609 recibiendo el galard n de su injusticia ya que tienen por delicia el gozar de deleites cada d a estos son inmundicias y manchas quienes aun mientras comen con vosotros se recrean en sus errores tienen los ojos llenos de adulterio no se sacian de pecar seducen a las almas inconstantes tienen el coraz n habituado a la codicia y son hijos de maldici n pero les ha acontecido lo del verdadero proverbio el perro vuelve a su v mito y la puerca lavada a revolcarse en el cieno
1959610 porque el ocuparse de la carne es muerte pero el ocuparse del esp ritu es vida y paz por cuanto los designios de la carne son enemistad contra dios porque no se sujetan a la ley de dios ni tampoco pueden y los que viven seg n la carne no pueden agradar a dios
1959611 jehov mir desde los cielos sobre los hijos de los hombres para ver si hab a alg n entendido que buscara a dios todos se desviaron a una se han corrompido no hay quien haga lo bueno no hay ni siquiera uno
1959612 no hay quien entienda no hay quien busque a dios
1959613 respondi jes s y le dijo de cierto de cierto te digo que el que no naciere de nuevo no puede ver comprender percibir el reino de dios
1959614 pero el hombre natural no percibe las cosas que son del esp ritu de dios porque para l son locura y no las puede entender porque se han de discernir espiritualmente
1959615 pero si nuestro evangelio est a n encubierto entre los que se pierden est encubierto en los cuales el dios de este siglo ceg el entendimiento de los incr dulos para que no les resplandezca la luz del evangelio de la gloria de cristo el cual es la imagen de dios
1959616 libr ndote de tu pueblo y de los gentiles a quienes ahora te env o para que abras sus ojos para que se conviertan de las tinieblas a la luz y de la potestad de satan s a dios para que reciban por la fe que es en m perd n de pecados y herencia entre los santificados
1959617 en l estaba la vida y la vida era la luz de los hombres la luz en las tinieblas resplandece y las tinieblas no prevalecieron contra ella
1959618 y esta es la condenaci n que la luz vino al mundo y los hombres amaron m s las tinieblas que la luz porque sus obras eran malas porque todo aquel que hace lo malo aborrece la luz y no viene a la luz para que sus obras no sean reprendidas
1959619 y dijo anda y di a este pueblo o d bien y no entend is ved por cierto mas no comprend is engruesa el coraz n de este pueblo y agrava sus o dos y ciega sus ojos para que no vea con sus ojos ni oiga con sus o dos ni su coraz n entienda ni se convierta y haya para l sanidad
1959620 por qu no entend is mi lenguaje porque no pod is escuchar mi palabra vosotros sois de vuestro padre el diablo y los deseos de vuestro padre quer is hacer el ha sido homicida desde el principio y no ha permanecido en la verdad porque no hay verdad en l cuando habla mentira de suyo habla porque es mentiroso y padre de mentira el que es de dios las palabras de dios oye por esto no las o s vosotros porque no sois de dios
1959621 pero dec a que lo que del hombre sale eso contamina al hombre porque de dentro del coraz n de los hombres salen los malos pensamientos los adulterios las fornicaciones los homicidios los hurtos las avaricias las maldades el enga o la lascivia la envidia la maledicencia la soberbia la insensatez todas estas maldades de dentro salen y contaminan al hombre
1959622 qui n podr decir yo he limpiado mi coraz n limpio estoy de mi pecado

1959633 the office of the high commissioner for human rights notes that the icj orders remain valid for another 50 mexican nationals on death row in the united states whose situation is similar to that of mr medellin
1959634 the finality of the death penalty makes it essential that it is applied with scrupulous attention to safeguards set down in international law
1959635 one of those safeguards is that foreign nationals should have access to consular services that is crucial for the protection of all individuals who travel abroad
1959636 international law cannot bind a state against its will simply because we dont have a world government a world legislature or a world judicial system
1959637 the will of the international community cannot be imposed on states just like that
1959638 the court cannot order a state to change its systems
1959639 if for no other reason governments need to respect the judgments of the icj out of long term self interest
1959640 even if a state does not like a ruling of the icj it is in everybodys long term interest that we have an international system governed by the rule of law

1959674 i do think electronic publishing is likely to further subvert the print media in the next few years but ive no doubt that the medium isnt altogether the message simply because theres another way of making views known it doesnt mean that good style research or engaging opinions arent required theres an aspect of the internet forums that presupposes and enacts that old canard that everyone has a novel in him i dont think everyone does at all and the net is a medium which unfortunately makes it easier for those who have bad novels and miscellaneous other screeds to get them out

1959738 want ik zal hem aan de hand recht naar uw bed voeren en hij zal wanen dat ik koningin gweniveres boodschapper ben
1959739 want er is niets in de wereld waarvan ik zo veel houd als van sir lancelot
1959740 sir lancelot du lac slaapt u mijn vrouwe koningin gwenivere ligt en wacht op u
1959741 ik ben gereed om met u te gaan waarheen u wilt
1959742 oh gij valse verraderlijke ridder zorg dat u nooit meer aan mijn hof komt en verdwijn snel uit mijn kamer en heb niet de moed gij valse verraderlijke ridder mij ooit nog onder ogen te komen
1959743 mevrouw u bent zeer te laken om sir lancelot want ik hoorde en zag aan zijn gelaat dat hij voor altijd waanzinnig is en daarom mevrouw heeft u helaas een grote zonde begaan en uzelf grote schande berokkend want u hebt een vorstelijke heer voor uzelf en daarom betaamde het u niet hem te beminnen want er is geen koningin ter wereld die zo een koning heeft als u en als u er niet geweest was had ik wellicht de liefde van mijn heer sir lancelot gekregen en ik heb alle reden om van hem te houden want hij kreeg mijn maagdelijkheid en hem heb ik een mooie zoon geschonken wiens naam sir galahad is en op zijn tijd zal hij de beste ridder van de wereld zijn
1959744 ik beveel u zo snel het dag is mijn hof te verlaten en bij uw liefde voor sir lancelot onthul zijn daden niet want als u dat doet zal het zijn dood zijn
1959745 ik durf te zeggen dat hij voor altijd verminkt is en dat heeft u gedaan en waarschijnlijk zullen noch gij noch ik hem nu nog ooit bezitten want hij slaakte de deerniswekkendste kreten die ik ooit een man hoorde slaken toen hij uit het gindse venster sprong ach
1959746 nu begrijp ik dat we hem voor altijd verloren hebben
1959747 ik heb nooit iets gezegd of gedaan dat hem op enige wijze zou kunnen misnoegen maar door het verwijt sir dat koningin gwenivere hem maakte zag ik hem in een zwijm op de grond vallen en toen hij bijkwam nam hij zijn zwaard in de hand en sprong uit het venster naakt behalve zijn hemd en slaakte de akeligste kreet die ik ooit een man hoorde slaken
1959748 en houd mijn heer koning arthur met een verhaal op zo lang u kunt want ik zal terugkeren naar koningin gwenivere en haar de waarheid zeggen en ik verzoek u als u ooit mijn dienst wilt hebben kijk goed uit of u bij toeval sir lancelot niet ziet
1959749 ik zal alles doen wat ik kan want ik wil net zo graag als u of wie ook van zijn verwanten of koningin gwenivere weten waar hij gebleven is en weet wel
1959750 ik zou liever mijn leven voor hem geven dan dat hij bezeerd zou worden
1959751 laat sir bors vertrekken en zich reppen wat hij kan om sir lancelot te zoeken want ik zeg u dat hij zijn verstand volkomen kwijt is maar toch zal hij geholpen kunnen worden en wel door een mirakel
1959752 want u weent nooit behalve als het geen zin heeft helaas dat ooit sir lancelot of iemand van zijn geslacht u zag want door u is de beste ridder van ons geslacht verloren hij die onze leider en onze toeverlaat was en ik durf zeggen en goedmaken dat alle koningen christenen noch heidenen nooit zulk een ridder zullen vinden zo edel en zo hoffelijk zo schoon en zo vriendelijk ach
1959753 en spaar geen middelen om hem te vinden want ik weet dat hij buiten zinnen is

1959806 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem he must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it it would seem that it would be in everyones best interest to come to terms with the situation and do whatever is necessary to fix it there is so much at risk during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences
