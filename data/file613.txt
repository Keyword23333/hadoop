6130000 i have not heard a dickie bird from middlesbrough they have gone nowhere near him
6130001 i couldnt say if anyone else will come in for my players before the transfer deadline there are still nearly two weeks to go and it may be that if a couple of premier league clubs have one or two bad results then they may decide on something but realistically i cant see it
6130002 we do need another left sided player and we do have a list of targets that we are working on there is nothing imminent but the search goes on but its not a desperate one because we have to find the right player
6130003 weve got to make sure we get support to the front men and get some really good balls up to them weve got to play to their strengths
6130004 if defoe likes the ball down the side lets get it down the side if crouch likes it up in the air or to his feet then lets do exactly that we have to learn what type of balls they like and make sure we provide them
6130005 its about getting the relationship right with the defenders and midfielders so whoever plays up front has the best opportunity to score
6130006 chelsea and manchester are going to be right up there again come the end of the season he said
6130007 im sure there will be a few other teams around making a nuisance of themselves and hopefully pompey will be one of those

6130009 i dont ask the experts in washington anymore i ask my neighbors
6130010 we aim to get as much out of this match as we can the under 21 game is more important on the night but we start our world cup qualifiers next month so we need to make the most of every opportunity to play together
6130011 we now feel everything is in place squad wise and player wise now we have to deliver we can now field an under 21 side that is not far short of 100 senior caps wales have never been able to do something like that in the past
6130012 but for the senior game we are missing five important players james collins danny gabbidon joe ledley craig bellamy and lewin nyatanga and once again we are suffering major injury bows
6130013 with every new manager it takes time but i feel we have the nucleus of a very good squad weve worked on things in training trying to get a shape in the way we want to play said the former southampton boss
6130014 it does take time and there arent many games to prepare so this is an important match unfortunately scotland havent qualified for ten years so ive told the players to make a bit of history and take their country to the world cup finals
6130015 its not going to be easy but they are certainly going to give it their best shot
6130016 i dont think anyone before has made excuses it just hasnt been good enough its as simple as that as players you take responsibility as individuals you take responsibility and as a team you have to do that
6130017 football is a team game and we have to look after each other and if we dont do that we have no chance its a tough group theres no question but we have as much chance as anyone else

6130042 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6130043 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6130044 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6130045 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6130046 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6130047 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6130048 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6130049 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6130050 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6130051 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6130052 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6130053 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6130054 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle

6130057 dat is een ander aspect waar we in de voorbereiding veel aandacht aan hebben besteed we hebben geleerd geen angst te hebben voor de spanning of ons te focussen op het resultaat onze grootste focus ligt bij het spel

6130074 we are unable to take your call and hang up on you
6130075 i never thought anything like that would happen unless id given up a memorable home run to barry bonds or something like that
6130076 they didnt want my blood pressure and heart rate to increase and possibly cause more swelling in my brain
6130077 but they told me after it was over that there were a couple of nights when they didnt know if i was going to make it through the night
6130078 its like an upside down sinker i call it a slinker
6130079 have you ever seen one of those slinkies thats kind of what his fastball does its a low to high release point similar to womens fast pitch softball
6130080 hes got a difficult angle and the ball moves a lot
6130081 the ball comes in at 80 something which makes him a little more difficult than other submariners
6130082 you know hes going to get righties out with his delivery but the way he can get lefties out is the thing thats impressed me the most

6130089 the more energy dense a food is the more a person with ear infections likes it you can see what that would do to weight gain
6130090 this finding gives a new environmental component to the obesity problem that allows a possibility of intervention
6130091 we need to study larger numbers of people and do taste testing on them to find out more about this possible connection
6130092 from what i have been able to see and without disrespecting my former team mates i have noticed that today sevilla have improved massively
6130093 im part of an impressive squad and i think its the best team we have had in four years

6130114 but cyclists are worse they go fast they have no respect for pedestrians and they are silent
6130115 do the buses really need to go down northbrook street we should get buses down park way thats the way forward to make newbury safer
6130116 its a very difficult that road because it all looks like its pedestrianised it is very unclear where the road stops and starts
6130117 there are no road markings or curbs but they let motor vehicles down it and cyclists as and when they like they weave in and out of the pedestrians
6130118 if it had been an old lady it could have been a lot worse
6130119 some blame is on some pedestrians they are just not switched on
6130120 they need to be aware of other things going on
6130121 until we can work out somewhere else for them to go we are a bit stuck we are hoping park way might solve that

6130127 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6130128 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 of the blame rests with us
6130129 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6130130 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6130131 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6130190 i have not just come here to play and then leave again
6130191 it is my hope that i do well enough for rangers that they want to sign me and keep me here on a permanent deal
6130192 my first target is to simply play good football in training and get into the team as i have come here to be successful
6130193 i am not even thinking about a life beyond rangers
6130194 it was a hard close game ballyholland put on a bit of a spurt after halftime but our boys battled back and i think the better team won

6130201 you drag and drop your files in to humyo and arrange them in files as you wish just like a normal desktop filing system humyo allows you to store 30gb of files for free the equivalent of approximately 7500 music files
6130202 we keep your files extra safe using the most advanced software and by guarding our servers behind former bullion vault doors so you have no need to worry about anyone else seeing them
6130203 i started my first business donhost at the age of 18 during the dotcom boom as one of the uks most successful web hosting companies it was sold to pipex in september 2004 in a multi million pound deal in which i was appointed managing director of pipex hosting after spending two years at pipex hosting i left to pursue other business opportunities which led to humyo com in january 2007

6130208 overcoming peoples initial reaction that storing their data online is a bad thing online data storage often conjures up images in peoples minds of the whole world having access to their private data or of losing their files when a web site disappears
6130209 when they think it through and consider the chances of someone overcoming our encryption systems or breaking into the former bullion vault where we keep our servers versus the chance of someone stealing their laptop their hard disk failing or a virus destroying it their trust in online data storage quickly builds it is still a challenge getting people to ignore their initial reaction think things through and take time to understand how we protect their data from every eventuality
6130210 as in 2000 many start ups have too great an emphasis on getting users with no real thought about how to generate revenue to support the service either banking on advertising revenue or that a conglomerate will place a value on the access to their user base and buy them out
6130211 what is different is that there are now a sufficient number of internet users and wide enough bandwidth to support many models that werent viable in 2000 2 0 startups that deliver genuine value through their service and have a solid revenue model will succeed
6130212 there are many new businesses and web thinkers that are slowly changing the way we use the internet however without a doubt apple is always the business to watch as it makes new technologies mainstream overnight the iphone has been revolutionary and shown consumers just how much how you can do from a mobile the mobile element of our offering has certainly been welcomed so you can see how demand for mobile applications is just going to grow and grow

6130214 joe is one of the reasons behind matt lockwood being allowed to leave we have to give joe a chance
6130215 he did well enough last season to make us believe he will do all right for us it is one of those situations we need to give him first team experience but anything we do will be with an eye on him having a better future with nottingham forest
6130216 we want him to put julian under threat but the only way to get to that is to get a loan spell under his belt somewhere
6130217 he has shown his worth against morecambe now and people will realise that he can handle it
6130218 the adverse weather conditions made it dangerous for the players so i had to call it off
6130219 the referee was right to call it off conditions were getting worse and it was dangerous

6130222 it was a hard one atticall battled to the end
6130223 they are a division two team and had really nothing to lose but were happy to get past them
6130224 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6130225 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6130226 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6130227 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6130228 just like good wine im maturing with age and i know plenty about good wine
6130229 my achievements are due to the generosity of my donors family they havent just changed my life they have given me life
6130230 i didnt expect to get anything because i wasnt well a few weeks ago and i was thinking to myself i might not do anything
6130231 but once i got there i felt so competitive and thought that i really want to win
6130232 a lot of people at the games think that it is great to take part but i want to win
6130233 i must have about 40 medals and they are all in a shoebox
6130234 i look forward to it every year and it is great to get away for the weekend but it is exhausting
6130235 i was getting up at 6am every day and because i didnt get a lot of training in this year i am quite sore
6130236 i always had a lot of belief in myself i suppose some people say too much belief but i have worked with different sports physiologists over the years and a friend of mine des jennings has been very good to me and did a lot of work with me and i suppose that came out of me that day
6130237 it was built into me that no matter what happens we were going to play to the end
6130238 but it wasnt just me that day and i suppose that was one of the more pleasing aspects of a long career
6130239 i said at the start of the season i would give it another year and i stuck to my word
6130240 i feel as if i have a bit left and i would like to give everything to the club so hopefully i can try and get more success with them
6130241 i had a good time playing county football but it is time to move on
6130242 obviously another all ireland would have be good but it just wasnt there for us and that is something i suppose a lot of players like kieran mcgeeney the macs john and tony mcentee and francie bellew would say that we should have won another all ireland
6130243 at the end of the day we still won the all ireland and that was something that armagh craved for so long so that makes the players i played with such a special bunch
6130244 i would be happy with the fact that we took armagh back to where we feel it belongs
6130245 when i first joined the armagh county panel it was nearly customary to go out on the first round of the championship every year i think we changed the thinking which is a lot about what we wanted to do
6130246 i have done a few things that i wanted to do and gambling was a major issue for me through the years
6130247 in that respect i suppose what i have done has been a success but at the same time i have to look after myself and concentrate on myself and i have a few more years of playing football
6130248 i start a two year counselling course in october in kildare and i am looking forward to that
6130249 we want to give companies tax breaks that do things right here in martinsville
6130250 i dont want those cars built in japan i want them built here
6130251 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6130252 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar
6130253 you can pick you friends but you cant pick your family

6130256 do flippant posturing oversimplifications exist and should they be negotiated with confronted or destroyed
6130257 they dont need five minutes to answer yes or no questions about the surge or russias invasion of a democratic neighbor

6130259 why dont you step up to the ledge my friend
6130260 dumping bureau chief aaron chambers who is generally considered one of the best reporters under the dome
6130261 frankly i made a choice between the bureau in springfield and local news in the rock river valley
6130262 its a loss but losing another local reporter would have been worse
6130263 the champaign news gazette closed its bureau earlier this year putting kate clements cohorst out of a job the chicago tribune eliminated one of its statehouse positions on friday laying off the incredibly hard working jeff meitrodt who was recruited from new orleans not long ago and as of yet the ap has not filled the vacancy created when ryan keith was hired by the state journal register so thats two bureaus and four reporting slots gone from the statehouse this year alone and its only august
6130264 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks

6130270 we are very close kilinochchi is not very far from our sight
6130271 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment
6130272 they are doing a great job a great job i would say even though there are ups and downs the achievements are great
6130273 they did not have defenses in that area so they could not prepare themselves to face the military threat
6130274 theres some more to go other areas to get kilinochchi mullaitivu
6130275 the troops are confident the soldiers are confident the army commander is confident
6130276 this silence is not good for the troops at all

6130279 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
6130280 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6130281 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6130282 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it mindarus ebayi
6130283 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days
6130284 its not uncommon to find insects in amber but im not sure that one has turned up on ebay that has been undiscovered before its a rather unusual route to come by a new species
6130285 use their phone to scan barcodes on ads in magazines and even in store windows
6130286 would either be a common expletive amongst recruits or an exhortation by an annoyed inspecting officer nco some however believe itdates back to an old practice amongst boys to catch spiders in the undergrowth house them in small boxes and make them fight

6130307 totesport are delighted to sponsor the replacement race for the totesport ebor now scheduled to be run at newbury
6130308 of course there is only one ebor and that race can only ever be run at york but the totesport newburgh handicap the original norman name for newbury will give the owners and trainers another opportunity to win a valuable staying handicap over the same trip
6130309 we are obviously disappointed to lose this weeks ebor meeting at york but look forward to renewing our association with this prestigious and historic race again next season
6130310 ruth quinn director of racing has performed minor miracles in getting this done at such short notice
6130311 a lot of the sponsors have been fantastic and the owners and trainers she has spoken to have in the main been incredibly helpful
6130312 out of the loss of a four day meeting like this there are some wonderful positives to racing in terms of what people can do in a crisis and this is a crisis

6130317 weve definitely been excited about the growth and embrace of technology by both voters and candidates
6130318 its been explosive its light years from 2004 youtube didnt exist four years ago and now it is being heavily used for politics
6130319 google is attempting to expand its influence over the political process to help it achieve its commercial goals
6130320 google likes to bask in self congratulatory rhetoric claiming it has the publics interests at heart its all about accessing peoples data for targeted marketing
6130321 in this us election year what information could be more important than the candidates own words to describe their views actions and platforms
6130322 as idealistic as that sounds is as idealistic as we are it is exciting all around not just for google

6130335 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6130336 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6130337 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6130338 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6130339 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6130340 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record

6130432 still it is amazing even for chicago standards that a group of political operators and university professors could loot over 100 million in 6 years that is a level of corruption id expect from the un
6130433 to put a mans mind into a fog so that he will mistake what is true for what is untrue what is right for what is wrong and come to believe what did not happen actually had happened
6130434 before i let this guy put his finger on the button i would have to give considerable pause
6130435 increased cumulative incidence rates of chronic disorders of the peripheral nervous system joints and back and an increased hazard rate of peptic ulcer

6130437 in the past senator mccain has conducted activities that had a positive impact in bringing the two nations vietnam united states closer that is a point that vietnamese people who follow the current affairs do recognize
6130438 demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i mccain did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant
6130439 have developed brain perversion techniques some of which are so subtle and so abhorrent to our way of life that we have recoiled from facing up to them

6130441 70 percent of the 7 190 u s prisoners held in china had either made confessions or signed petitions calling for an end to the american war effort in asia fifteen percent collaborated fully with the chinese and only 5 percent steadfastly resisted

6130443 none of the returned u s prisoners of war released by vietnam were ever interrogated by the soviets
6130444 the signs are all there im afraid senator john mccain has been brainwashed

6130446 we stuck to our game plan early and often and were doing the little things correctly
6130447 but for whatever reason were kind of almost scared out there to play confident and stick to the system and we turned the puck over and missed assignments and then the puck is in the net a few times
6130448 h p continues to execute in core disciplines amid somewhat challenging market conditions
6130449 deposit pricing pressure has intensified while asset margin expansion has been muted as banks are all chasing the same low risk borrowers

6130455 we applaud assembly speaker sheldon silver and other assembly members who clearly understand the need to deliver real relief to senior citizens middle class homeowners and other new yorkers burdened by high property taxes
6130456 by rejecting a destructive tax cap and choosing to push a circuit breaker and a more progressive income tax structure the assembly is delivering real tax relief over a gimmick that panders to the lowest common denominator and political expediency
6130457 the assembly plan would deliver tax deductions in the thousands of dollars to those new yorkers who need and deserve relief from high property taxes and would do it in a fair way based on their ability to pay
6130458 under the speakers leadership the assembly is ensuring public schools will have the resources to continue providing opportunity and hope to children especially those who live in poverty
6130459 millionaires tax supported by nearly 9 in 10 new yorkers would raise a projected 2 6 billion annually for the state treasury lubin said a more progressive income tax structure would more than compensate the state budget for the estimated 1 6 billion cost of the circuit breaker
6130460 its time for those who reaped the lions share of tax cuts in the past to now pay their fair share to protect essential public services like education and health care
6130461 many of nysuts 600 000 members are property taxpayers and they want relief from high property taxes too
6130462 but not at the expense of their students and their schools

6130466 the law says it is an offence for a person in a position of authority over another to sexually touch someone if they are under 18
6130467 sufficient to taint the subsequent statement and to cry out for its exclusion to hold otherwise is to invite the perception that the police are legally entitled to reap the benefit of their own infringements of a suspects constitutional rights and this in my view would bring the administration of justice into disrepute
6130468 the concept of recovered memory by victims of abuse has been accepted by both the scientific and legal communities as well as the jury who convicted mr shanley after hearing the full evidence in this case
6130469 we literally generated whole tubes in the lab from scratch
6130470 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
6130471 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
6130472 cream city ribbon is about much more than just creating a pretty package its ribbon that expresses our shared commitment to the environment
6130473 our manufacturing processes date back to the 1920s but our use of organic materials and soy based inks are about making a product that is good for the world today
6130474 the uses for ribbon are endless and with 29 available colors and unlimited patterns from cream city ribbon its easy to be both style savvy and eco conscious

6130480 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months
6130481 were going to see a whopper were going to see a failure of a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
6130482 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6130483 is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
6130484 it is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way
6130485 that may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see
6130486 i certainly dont think the federal funds rate should be any lower given where we are now
6130487 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6130488 once again the majority of our negative estimate revisions are being driven by higher than estimated write downs on mortgage assets
6130489 also seeing results being negatively impacted by slower levels of client activity and expenses and fines from auction rate securities
6130490 with this as a backdrop a lower level of corporate and institutional activity is likely to ensue until the financial markets stabilize
6130491 give me a call weve still got shirts with odom on the back
6130492 this is never easy especially since all of these players worked hard during their tenure here
6130493 in particular in the case of each of the veterans its especially difficult to release players who have been productive and valued members of the organization however we feel these decisions are in the best interest of the team
6130494 i want to thank all of them for their contributions to the dolphins and wish them good luck
6130495 these people need a new ouija board all these big smart guys forecast there would be an increase of 800 000 barrels its an increase of crude oil of 9 4 million barrels
6130496 my guess is that there is till some suspicion that with at least a partial relationship with u s financials canadian banks are going to have to show some kind of stress some kind of writedown on some of their assets which they havent done so far
6130497 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record

6130505 the five leases that have made up the shell perdido project off galveston since 1996 are not classified as producing only when it starts pumping the equivalent of an estimated 130 000 barrels of oil per day at the end of the decade will it be deemed active since 1996 shell has paid rent on the leases filed and had approved numerous reports with the mss minerals management service including an environmentally sensitive resource development plan and an oil spill recovery plan that is subject to unannounced practice runs by the mms drilled several wells to explore the area at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars and started constructing the necessary infrastructure to bring the oil to market
6130506 the notion that oil companies are just sitting on oil leases is a myth

6130510 you know selling china in 2008 is like selling america in 1908 sure lets say the market goes down another 40 so what you look back over 100 years you look back from the beauty of 1928 or even 1938 in the depths of the great depression and there is somebody who bought shares in 1908 he was still a lot better off having not sold in 1908
6130511 a mixed public and private practice can be a positive if it contributes to improved access to health care
6130512 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing 5 to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6130513 shutting the door on private health care is the same as shutting the door on our patients

6130522 i wanted something that i had in my other house that i could say was mine and these are the two things i have nothing else
6130523 this was portrayed as though there was some big bomb there and there wasnt
6130524 these chemicals had been there for some time and nothing dangerous happened the record in this case speaks for itself
6130525 we had no evidence so there was no way we could have prevailed at that point
6130526 state pensions are strictly for employees of state and local governments

6130535 in this situation we feel that the child does qualify for services and were ready to provide that

6130544 gathering comprehensive data about the dead from civilians is a time consuming task
6130545 we have to cross check data and check that people are not misidentified or miscounted
6130546 we have to make sure there is no double counting if a body is moved we have to be careful not to count it twice maybe it is counted once in the village itself and then it could be counted again in the city morgue
6130547 to get really accurate figures you would really have to go to every single village
6130548 we do take allegations of arrests of people missing or reported dead we can also offer our services to the authorities for the transfer of mortal remains
6130549 all the work we do is gathering confidential information which we share with the authorities with the aim of finding out the location of loved ones for the civilian population
6130550 there has been a lot of controversy about the russian figures
6130551 when that figure came out of 1 500 dead it wasnt very helpful it didnt provide any sourcing or methodology there were no details about how the figure was calculated we certainly cant confirm it
6130552 the problem here is that when russia puts out a figure like that it does two things it distracts attention from where there are violations and from the real scale of what is happening
6130553 if you have a military objective then the grad rocket is not a targeted weapon civilians are going to get hit and that is exactly what happened and happened on a significant scale the proximity was such that it was indiscriminate
6130554 a basic rule of the geneva convention is that whenever there is a shadow of a doubt that a civilian target might be hit then you dont fire

6130560 the only important factor was the oral contraceptive pill clotting is a well known risk of using the contraceptive pill there is no other medication that has such a big risk as the oral contraceptive pill

6130571 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
6130572 health care costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6130573 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
6130574 you have to see the circuit map and try to see more or less the difficult corners and easier corners but then until you are racing there you really dont know for example where the braking points are ferrari 430gt there a few weeks ago so i now have a basic understanding of the circuit however for my first visit there with gp2 i think it will be very important to do the full 30 minutes of free practice not to lose any time and to do as many laps as we can
6130575 before you were a wife before you were a mother before you were even a human being you were an artist

6130580 so all applications running on our platforms will be able to use it
6130581 looked at lots of different companies and instranet won the gold for their technology and their solutions
6130582 can be deployed in a matter of two to 12 weeks depending on the size of the company and the number of agents it has because its all point and click
6130583 a lot of people were asking me does having a baby make you want to do more commercial type stuff
6130584 i guess my answer was and still is if that means compromising something artistically no it doesnt make me want to do that yes i want to make a living and i want to be able to help provide for my family but i also feel like i want my child to grow up and be proud of what her father is doing
6130585 i was pretty young when i wrote a lot of those songs
6130586 it was really personal kind of memoir ish if you can have something thats memoir ish at 25
6130587 i decided i really just want to make music that reflects the kind of music that i love
6130588 i didnt want to get stuck in the guy with a guitar singer songwriter thing
6130589 i felt like if youre thinking too much about what youre saying you can impose ideals on a song that dont belong there whereas an emotion just needs to be conveyed somehow and there are certain words or certain sounds that go along with that
6130590 i like it really big and grandiose in a lot of ways and neilson is quite the opposite a lot of times
6130591 he is the king of subtlety and wanting to strip things down quite a bit and having a lot of space so i felt like there was a balance that was struck there
6130592 i loved it but we had other people listen to it and theyre like thats too much to ask
6130593 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6130594 when i first saw it i just thought that you really really enjoyed programming in java
6130595 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
6130596 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector
6130597 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6130598 if we had the territorial integrity of serbia in the case of kosovo then we would have the territorial integrity of georgia with regard to south ossetia and abkhazia

6130600 i dont think you can control all the world from one center what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge

6130606 it would be dangerous for anyone to write off microsoft
6130607 microsoft believes its found a way to gain an edge against googles dominant search engine a deeper understanding of what people are searching for and whats on web pages specifically the company believes examining a full sequence of user queries can lead to more useful results today the company only keeps track of the immediately prior search but often users use search engines to explore subject areas broadly said satya nadella senior vice president of microsofts search portal and advertising platform group at the search engine strategies conference here
6130608 im spending most of this week at the intel developers forum but also wanted to give some time to another show happening in the bay area this week search engine strategies being held at the san jose convention center in silicon valley monday was one of those unofficial days of the show a handful of sessions and an opening keynote but no expo yet so it was hard to gauge the sort of impact the show will have but based on a few hours of hanging around and popping in and out of sessions its clear that search remains a hot sector with a lot of moving parts
6130609 unlike eight years ago paid search campaigns are no longer a hard sell still search marketers say they are havent reached the equivalent of marketing nirvana ensuring that search is always part of an integrated campaign however search marketers and others speaking at the search engine strategies conference this week in san jose ca pointed to inroads being made
6130610 delivering the best results is the key to growing microsofts search marketing business said satya nadella svp of microsofts search portal and advertising group

6130627 for obama faith is not simply political garb something a focus group told him he ought to try instead religion to him is transforming lifelong and real
6130628 heres a democratic candidate whos saying i think faith ought to come into play in the public square in an age when we know what kind of underwear a presidential candidate wears and what his dogs name is we certainly ought to know what he believes in religiously especially if hes saying hes going to carry it into the oval office

6130643 there is a real difference between the audibility of hybrid vehicles and those with traditional internal combustion engines that could have effects on the safety of pedestrians which needs to be studied
6130644 our findings could mean that there is an added danger with hybrid cars particularly at intersections and in parking lots
6130645 subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about 28 feet away
6130646 but they could only judge the hybrids approach direction when it was seven feet away
6130647 this research provides evidence that hybrid cars when operating in silent mode pose a substantial risk to blind people and other pedestrians we hope that regulators and car manufacturers will take notice of these results and take steps to eliminate this risk
6130648 i really do feel this is an issue for more than those who are blind

6130718 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6130719 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6130720 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6130721 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6130722 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6130723 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6130724 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure

6130730 its great i have a great feeling this is a dream come true really
6130731 you come out here every day as an athlete to be a champion and this is just more than i can handle really im just happy for myself
6130732 to tell you the truth i was worried because after the semi finals i was kind of feeling a bit tired and i was saying coach its going to be rough
6130733 but i just told myself and i told everyone i was going to run hard here and leave everything on the track and i did just that
6130734 i feel great i cant explain how i feel i just proved to the world that im a true champion and that with hard work you can do anything possible

6130748 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6130749 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6130750 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6130751 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6130752 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6130753 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6130754 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6130755 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6130756 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6130757 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6130758 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6130759 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6130760 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6130761 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6130762 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6130763 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6130764 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6130765 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6130766 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

6130771 if she didnt like you she wouldnt allow you to give somebody a higher mark
6130772 with this in mind how does that encourage people to excel if they know in the end theyll get a 3 needless to say the payout from nsps was well below what i would have gotten had i still been a general schedule employee receiving a step increase
6130773 low level supervisors were allowed only to offer recommendations about employee ratings to pay pool managers rather than make final judgments
6130774 this system is a return to the days of the good ole boys club and graft and corruption are the cornerstone
6130775 as a career federal employee im disgusted the level of deceit lack of ethics and integrity that is surfacing under the nsps is appalling
6130776 i could not stand what they were doing at dtra and there were about four people in my division that left
6130777 man on the street approach ive heard rumors about nsps going by the wayside next year if funding isnt extended past the current date i believe funding expires end of fy09 what in the world would that mean for those of us already under nsps
6130778 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6130779 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6130780 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6130781 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6130782 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6130783 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6130784 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6130785 who are open to doing something on the production side
6130786 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6130787 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6130788 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6130789 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6130790 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6130791 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6130792 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6130793 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6130794 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6130795 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6130796 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6130797 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6130798 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6130799 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6130800 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6130801 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6130802 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6130803 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6130804 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6130805 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6130806 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6130807 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6130808 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6130809 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6130810 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6130811 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6130812 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6130813 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6130814 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6130815 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6130816 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6130817 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6130818 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6130819 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6130820 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6130821 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6130822 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6130823 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6130824 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6130825 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6130826 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6130827 les m decins peuvent aller maintenant plus loin que la th rapie bas e sur des crit res ethniques et entrer dans la pr cision de la g nomique personnalis e
6130828 i dont know if im staying im just leaning that way
6130829 ive been here for three years and thats what id like to do well talk about some things this afternoon between my dad and my mom and coach friedgen
6130830 to be honest im not sure right now i have a lot of support from my family it doesnt matter if people say i should stay or if i should go or this or that i want to stay i would never want to leave but given the circumstances its something i had to consider im leaning toward staying
6130831 as the backup my role is to prepare as the starter in case the starter goes down if thats my role so be it like i said last year i knew at some point i was going to go in it would be wrong for me to sit here and say im staying because i think someone will get hurt or someone is going play poorly but the chances of a backup playing in a 13 game season are pretty high
6130832 its been up and down mostly up i havent been too bummed out i was bummed when i heard the news but like i said ive had a lot of support from my family friends and teammates
6130833 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good
6130834 sources have revealed exclusively to me that ryan and rachel are definitely together again they are on holiday in toronto and are both very happy
6130835 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6130836 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6130837 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6130838 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6130839 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6130840 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6130841 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6130842 unless some kind of miracle happens i dont see it
6130843 its not just for me but for the people you drive
6130844 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
6130845 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6130846 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6130847 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
6130848 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6130849 everything in our life is kind of potential right now
6130850 michael and i are definitely going to go into some business ventures together what those are we have some ideas but we dont have any specifics
6130851 in the long term there will be other facilities and theyll be nice ones
6130852 were going to go back kind of assess where we are and what we want to do and take it from there
6130853 michaels vision is to increase swimming in the united states and the world
6130854 im sure well be working with kids teaching them how to swim and maybe expanding our swim school operations
6130855 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6130856 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6130857 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6130858 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6130859 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6130860 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6130861 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6130862 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6130863 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6130864 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6130865 he was like seven seven and a half when he started playing with me hes never had any instructor
6130866 he just learned it just playing with me im an average golfer
6130867 hopefully he keeps playing and practicing hopefully he can play for some college
6130868 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6130869 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6130870 i think that in back of my mind i was hoping that one day i would feel well enough to see if the place was here
6130871 i dont know if im staying im just leaning that way
6130872 it is amazing how similar the image scores appear to be for both barack obama and john mccain if obama is this agent of change that america has been waiting for why is his image no better than the nominee from the other party a political party whose brand is supposed to be so badly damaged
6130873 the most technically advanced container port in the world integrated with europes largest logistics park
6130874 will see the construction of the first phase of the ports quay providing three berths and over 1 2 kilometres of quay
6130875 will eventually handle 3 5 million teu twenty foot equivalent units providing a much needed increase in capacity for the uks container terminals
6130876 the big three broadcast networks have showered obama with positive even glowing news coverage protected the candidates from the attacks of his rivals and shown little interest in investigating past associations or exploring the controversies that could have threatened his campaign
6130877 congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press
6130878 force them to be more unfair with obama than they already are
6130879 of course its impossible to assess how obama stacked up against the other candidates since he is the only one examined
6130880 i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
6130881 he wants to move on from the race debate but his campaign manager rick davis aggressively attacked obama for allegedly playing the race card just today
6130882 nous avons lintime conviction de donner une chance des gens qui sont dispos s se prendre en main
6130883 nous ne voulions pas entrer dans une logique du chat et de la souris
6130884 passengers will experience speeds similar to the mobile broadband experience on the ground
6130885 way more than what the market was looking for and as a result we have come off our highs
6130886 you are just picking up some extra cargos that are just getting counted
6130887 we generally do work off inventories at this time of year a draw is not unusual
6130888 report is not showing that demand is picking up any
6130889 what we are seeing is a global slowdown in the economy and that is contributing to the weaker demand numbers that we have seen
6130890 that concept is starting to change these high prices are having an effect on global growth and it will slow down demand going forward
6130891 now people are looking at the market with more reality
6130892 has stabilized and she is receiving the best care available
6130893 i wanted to stay i wanted to play i wanted to love you
6130894 if i die before im old oh brother of mine please dont forget me if i go if i die before my time oh sweet sister of mine please dont regret me if i die
6130895 celebrate we will for life is short but sweet for certain
6130896 will work with our allies to assure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6130897 my rehabilitation program has been progressing very well and i am thrilled that i will be able to participate in these youth soccer clinics
6130898 and while i am disappointed that i was not able to be a part of the u s national teams olympic medal efforts i am so very proud of the teams performance it is great that they will be playing for the gold medal tomorrow i wish i could be with them i will be watching and cheering for them and for a win i look forward to being with my upstate new york fans in early september
6130899 abby wambach is proving once again what a great role model she is for youth in this case a role model for how to deal with adversity
6130900 we are thrilled that her rehabilitation is going so well and that she will be able to be with us this fall
6130901 it is the objective of mvp health care and preferred care to include as many young people as possible at these abby wambach soccer clinics
6130902 so we are asking that those who are requesting tickets limit their requests to the number of young people in their family who are certain to be able to attend
6130903 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
6130904 union a union between man and woman between one man and one woman thats my definition of marriage
6130905 are we going to get back to the importance of supreme court justices
6130906 i believe marriage is the union between a man and a woman
6130907 for me as a christian its also a sacred in the mix
6130908 i strongly support preserving the unique status of marriage between man and woman
6130909 im a federalist i believe that the state should make those decisions
6130910 that doesnt mean that they dont have the rights of all citizens im not saying that i am saying that we should preserve the unique status of marriage between one man and one woman and if a federal court decided that my state of arizona had to observe what the state of massachusetts decided then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the state should make the decisions within their own states
6130911 because historically we have not defined marriage in our constitution its been a matter of state law that has been our tradition
6130912 the reason people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment is some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions i do believe that for gay partners to want to visit each other in the hospital for state to say you know what thats alright i dont think in any way inhibits my core beliefs about what marriage is i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or different view
6130913 strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
6130914 proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution of the united states of america and not legislating from the bench
6130915 but when it comes to the programs that are federally funded
6130916 we do have to be careful to make sure we are not creating a situation where people are being discriminated against using federal money
6130917 obama said he believes local laws in some states prohibiting discrimination against gays would apply to faith based social programs funded with federal money in those states
6130918 experts estimate that if we keep on the current course 75 percent of americans will be overweight or obese by 2015
6130919 but it is clear now that while personal responsibility is an important part of the equation there are many factors beyond individual control
6130920 employees should be encouraged to engage in physical activity on their lunch hours and breaks employers have long allowed smokers to step outside for 10 minutes for a cigarette break
6130921 they get sorted male female speciated and then the culex will be sent to uc davis for virus testing
6130922 the virus is probably here its just probably not had the days of high temperatures in needs to amplify in the mosquito to pass along to humans
6130923 im reminded of the book and the movie sophies choice where a woman has to decide which child she is going to allow to die and thats the kind of decision it feels like to me
6130924 i think that it would be up to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
6130925 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
6130926 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
6130927 needs to give the pro life and the values voters a reason to be enthusiastic
6130928 people who are not necessarily hard core republicans but who vote republican because of life and marriage they may vote or they may not but they may not bring anybody with them to the polls
6130929 my church teaches and i do believe that human rights begin early in life at conception or shortly thereafter and that is my personal belief
6130930 i dont believe the force of criminal law should compel others to necessarily follow that to the greatest degree
6130931 we shouldnt criminalize the health care decisions of doctors and women to fight abortion
6130932 carmen muri en lo que ella siempre hac a una actividad pol tica baj ndose de un avi n con 87 a os hasta el ltimo momento y permanente ah y yo s que es la fuerza y el valor en nuestros adultos mayores

6130936 es una p rdida dura e irremplazable y el desaf o del ps es sintonizar con la juventud para encontrar m s juanes bustos y carmenes lazo
6130937 fue una figura emblem tica de la pol tica chilena una mujer vital y comprometida hasta el ltimo y al mismo tiempo con una capacidad de di logo con todo el mundo yo creo que deja una huella muy imborrable
6130938 ella fue una gran compa era de allende yo creo que m s all de banderas pol ticas mucha gente la va a recordar como la quer amos mucho la negra lazo fue concejala pol tica y en definitiva una gran mujer chilena

6130943 renewing americas promise starts with leaders who put the needs of the american people first the women of the united states senate serve as an inspiration to us all
6130944 the 2008 convention is excited to honor these leaders and to highlight their checklist for change
6130945 american families want change and the women of the united states senate are committed to helping deliver it for them
6130946 from pay equity to protecting the family checkbook making health care affordable and taking care of our military families there is a clear difference between the two parties and the two candidates voters have a clear choice this year if they want to move the country forward the women of the united states senate stand ready to deliver our checklist for change

6130953 i pray that god himself will come and drown the president if the levees break again
6130954 i feel comfortable now playing not only the creepy dark acoustic songs but also cranking it up on the electric
6130955 well you know being the half kenyan harvard graduate from illinois in his early forties not running for president this years election gives me a unique perspective
6130956 ive always felt more comfortable on the other side of the barbed wire fence you know lobbing musical molotov cocktails at the party
6130957 if america elects a black president it will be a different country than the one ive seen my entire life and that would be a step definitely in the right direction
6130958 hmmm lookie here at this hole in the wall wonder what thats all about

6130963 i got out good i ran the corner as hard as possible and once i entered the straight told myself to keep it up dont die on me now
6130964 this morning it did rekindle up in the attic space so weve been here for about an hour and a half putting out hot spots
6130965 we have lacked ruthlessness in tight heineken cup games and how many times have we failed to get a bonus point try in the magners league
6130966 you can relate some of this back to the age of our squad
6130967 every year they are learning we scraped through from our heineken cup pool last season and then we were unbelievably disappointing in the quarter final at saracens
6130968 hopefully this season well learn from that experience but generally we have failed to really be ruthless in these games
6130969 thats something we really want to change and focus on
6130970 but you can talk about being ruthless and it becomes pretty wishy washy but its about how you become ruthless in terms of what we do as forwards how we complement what our backs are doing in attack
6130971 under pressure do we deliver the skills are our core skills good enough to be able to be ruthless these are all the things weve been working on
6130972 we intend to go out there and be true to ourselves these are the things weve worked on and hopefully thats what people will see from us this season
6130973 i think seeing what went on behind the scenes with the all blacks coaches will help in dealing with the pressures of being part of the ospreys management
6130974 we want to create the same sort of environment we want to create an environment or values that we can go back to and to ask ourselves if we are living them
6130975 you win you lose thats fine but you have to know why you won and why you lost
6130976 thats difficult and sometimes its not about what you do on the field its about what happens off it and hopefully the experience in new zealand will stand us in good stead
6130977 we are very excited to be the first doubles team to qualify for the sony ericsson championships
6130978 weve had a great year so far and look forward to finishing the season in doha and defending our championships title
6130979 we are of course very happy to be the first to qualify for the sony ericsson championships
6130980 the championships are a perfect ending to a hard fought season and we are excited to play this year in doha
6130981 both cara and liezel have repeatedly demonstrated that they are on great form this season so it came as no surprise that they are the first doubles team to qualify for the 2008 sony ericsson championships in doha
6130982 we are delighted to have these top players compete at this end of season tournament and are sure that their considerable talent will mean that the audience are going to be treated to a truly exciting event
6130983 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6130984 richie played outstandingly and his presence on the field was a huge positive but overall the guys had the guts to hang in there and do the business at the finish i have huge pride in what they did they showed tremendous courage
6130985 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
6130986 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
6130987 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
6130988 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
6130989 the contest is to get as many votes as we can to not support the two major candidates
6130990 our atom processor is off to a very rapid start and has exceeded our expectations by far
6130991 it is possible that is may be just a coincidence having two cases at nearly the same time but we want to investigate to determine for sure the cause and to make sure whatever the cause that it does not occur again

6131012 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states

6131016 duponts vision is to be the worlds most dynamic science company creating sustainable solutions essential to a better safer healthier life for people everywhere
6131017 sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
6131018 sustainability in the chemical industry grand challenges amp research needs
6131019 since 1850 there has been an evolution of both energy resources as well as the source of feedstocks for the commodity chemical industry in 1850 the predominant fuels were wood or other biomass depending upon location during the time period the chemical enterprise was relatively small
6131020 however as the industrial revolution gained momentum the need for new chemicals and new materials to meet the growing demands of industry and consumers increased at the turn of the twentieth century carbon based chemical feedstocks were already primarily derived from coal over the course of the twentieth century global political and economic forces initiated significant change during that time the united states and subsequently the global chemical enterprise moved farther away from renewable sources of carbon based feedstock and became heavily dependent on fossil fuels crude oil and natural gas both as a feedstock for commodity chemicals and as a primary energy source
6131021 the chemical process industry cpi consumes about 7 7 percent of all the energy fossil fuels electricity etc resources used in the united states of this about 50 percent of the energy resources are used as chemical feedstocks rather than consumed as energy
6131022 humanitys collective fate will ultimately come down to our ability to shift the way we produce and consume energy and fuels and the way we design develop produce and use chemicals and chemical products the multiple technological pathways that will be needed will have to come from improving the efficiencies of current technologies creating myriad new parallel technologies to choose from and recycling like never before

6131051 ook de mogelijkheid om door te schuiven naar nieuwbouw wordt kleiner omdat de bouw van betaalbare woningen hapert
6131052 het is voor deze nigerianen goed toeven in nederland voor het ontvangen van hun buit maken zij echter het liefst gebruik van bankrekeningen in andere landen dan waar zij zich zelf bevinden op die manier wordt de opsporing bemoeilijkt het meest populair zijn momenteel vooral chinese spaanse en britse banken
6131053 wij stellen precies dezelfde eisen als andere banken in nederland om een rekening te kunnen openen
6131054 after 9 11 a lot of customers were not able to recover not the ibm ones but the customers are now more and more demanding to be sure they will be able to recover
6131055 vermoedelijk omdat beleggen in vastrentende waarden minder aantrekkelijk is geworden vanwege de stijgende inflatie
6131056 ze merken het effect van de ontwikkelingen van de internationale onroerendgoedmarkten
6131057 we willen graag een mooi rendement op ons pensioen maar liever niet te veel risicos nemen op de beurs nu de koersen dalen en het vertrouwen zoek is tegelijkertijd moeten met name jongeren oppassen dat hun pensioen niet te veel inteert door de oplopende inflatie
6131058 dat betekent dat je als twintiger of dertiger zult moeten proberen je rendement te maken met aandelen en als je ouder wordt moet je defensiever handelen door bijvoorbeeld in obligaties te gaan
6131059 het risico nemen en beleggen zit ons wat dat betreft iets minder in het bloed dan de amerikanen
6131060 mijn advies aan iemand in de twintig die ons target date fonds overweegt zou zijn stap eerst 10 tot 15 jaar in een van onze gewone aandelenfondsen en kom daarna nog eens terug
6131061 wij moedigen mensen daarom juist wel aan om vanaf hun dertigste in ons target date fonds te stappen mocht je immers verliezen maken in de aanvangsfase dan biedt een verre horizon voldoende mogelijkheden die verliezen goed te maken naarmate je ouder wordt zorgt het glijpad voor voldoende zekerheid omdat de laatste jaren grotendeels wordt belegd in depositos staatsobligaties en inflatiegerelateerde obligaties we vinden extra garantie niet nodig omdat die garanties zoals bij de targetclickfondsen van dws geld kunnen kosten door lager opwaarts potentieel bij stijgende aandelenkoersen je profiteert minder mee van stijgende koersen omdat het risico ergens van bekostigd moet worden
6131062 willen nederlanders steeds meer zelf voor hun pensioen zorgen omdat ze niet alleen afhankelijk willen zijn van de aow uitkering

6131066 its kind of breaking the ice first before asking him to change his mind
6131067 while there was a small month on month increase in activity it represented a notable decline from a year ago
6131068 it was a typical 1500 especially for the conditions i think milers are a little finicky about the weather particularly wind we were just tip toeing around at first there was a lot of jostling throughout i was boxed in much of the time
6131069 i had an opportunity in the home straight i felt great but i blew it because of my bad positioning i felt i could have been in the top three today i should have gotten myself up closer to lagat and manzano
6131070 the way lomong and manzano have been running in recent years its certainly no surprise to see them on the team im surprised there werent more guys without a times who went with gabe he was the one who took up the challenge the rest of us got to go along for the ride
6131071 i felt comfortable the whole way even following gabe i was more confident today than any other day of the trials
6131072 with 500 to go i knew it was time to go to the front i thought alan or someone might surprise me at some point the third lap i ran wide the whole way to make sure no one could box me into the rail
6131073 the race suited me fine i didnt worry about the pace i was very confident if fast i have the strength if it came down to a mad kick i was still confident i could pull it out
6131074 its very special honestly to be on this american olympic team with two other runners who came to the country for their own reasons and now were all united together on this team
6131075 i dont have a lot to learn about 5k racing but in the 1500 it took me a long time to learn how to run off a slow pace now i feel that i can respond however the race develops
6131076 my coach and i had many plans plan a b through d one for a slow pace one for a fast pace when the pace started to settle i just sat back and relaxed i moved outside to run my own race
6131077 at the beginning of the meet i ran the 800s to work on my speed confidence and so i would be able to run faster at the end of the 1500 so when the pace was slow that was fine with me
6131078 each step of the way i needed to focus on each round i would visualize it like it was a final today i was really excited to race i knew i needed to be up front when racing these kind of guys you have to be ready for it
6131079 for people that saw what happened out there its a testament that anything is possible we all come from very poor backgrounds its a big honor for us to go out there and run for the us
6131080 from 200m in i could tell we werent going to get the a standard im disappointed i didnt get third but were sending a great team i just tried to pick off as many guys as i could i was trying to be a good competitor and it was great experience in championship racing on the starting line i think about how everyone is writing me off as oh hes just that d3 kid hes not going anywhere me and nick both are excited to be representing d3 this meet was very successful for me it has catapulted me to a new level as far as my career goes
6131081 3 45 3 41 3 36 how did this happen it was the right coaching i was through a lot of coaching situations that were just not right for me today the problem the last 300m was my lungs i still 10 min after the race cant breathe right
6131082 the time was out the window on a day like today i was hoping someone would take it out im not in shape to do 3 36 myself right now but the pollen or something caught up with me ill be ready for it next time ive had exercise induced asthma before and allergies ill get it checked out and get something for it
6131083 i wanted it real bad we werent on pace so i went to the front its tough to win from the front when youve got 10 guys behind you who can run 3 33
6131084 forces were trying to put obstacles in front of me the whole way it was hard to lead but i didnt have a choice i felt trapped i cant retire on a race like that i need revenge i cant go hide id never forgive myself i need redemption i still have a lot to prove
6131085 i give all props to lagat im proud to be part of the u s resurgence in distance running i guess ill have to stick around and do this again in another four years if its going to be london itll be london
6131086 im in my best shape ever i just couldnt put it together i got boxed and i tried to pull a nick symmonds but it took too long and the guys just got away from me its been a stressful year having to chase the a standard but im just 24 and i hope ill have two more shots at this at age 28 with another 16 000 miles behind me i think ill be a force to be reckoned with im still growing and maturing im quite confident that i have my best years ahead of me
6131087 beat the pants of the world champion in three different races in 2007
6131088 does not have the mental toughness to compete at a world class level
6131089 thats okay im fine i can wait until three to go
6131090 i should have done this i should have done that
6131091 no i cant do that thats not the way the rules work
6131092 torri edwards agent danny escamilla reports that edwards has decided to focus on the 100 meters and didnt want to risk injury by running the 200m out of lane 1
6131093 i felt confident in my strength i was very focused on myself on the time we had a hurricane behind us so it was not that impressive on the beijing olympics everyone is going to be more prepared the jamaicans are going to be phenomenal
6131094 im just really happy i dont know how else to explain it
6131095 i felt myself falling but i had to keep pushing forward i was falling but i was able to control it on the 100 meters lauryn is a great competitor and im really happy for her i had to block it all out and focus on the making the team in the 200 weve had a tough trials here i knew i was going to work hard in the 200
6131096 me ine sehr geehrten damen und he rren liebe neger
6131097 making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
6131098 i saw walter out of the corner of my eyes man i felt like i won it but you never really know with the photo finishes when i saw it i said dang he got me
6131099 im 30 my legs are pretty beat up ive done this before in championships but at 30 its even tougher
6131100 anybody including usain bolt can be beaten on any given day im not excited that ill be competing against bolt in beijing im excited to represent myself and my country against everyone at the olympics on any given day me or the two guys beside me can run fast and win
6131101 these past four years have been difficult but i stayed in mentally and physically i could have gone to the ground but with patience and diligence i came back up on tyson gay hes the fastest guy on the planet and we are sharing this moment with him all of us are making history we hate to see him hurt but at the same time with him out it took a lot of pressure off the field im just keeping it real
6131102 when i came toward the finish i knew i had to relax all the way through
6131103 my dad was my high school coach but he always drilled me to get my grades first and then to worry about athletics
6131104 i just tried to keep my head in the race and stick to the plan once we got going the pacce was slow so i pushed it a little early once i went i wanted to just keep driving to the finish since my injury last year ive just tried to make each month and each day better than the last i naver expected to be the favorite when we got to the trials but i was very confident in myself and my training i knew i had done everything i could to prepare
6131105 every day since i started training with coach cook it just felt like we were doing everything we could as well as we could and its just good to be sitting here having done it and just move on
6131106 i felt great until i got onto the track today then i dont know if it was nerves or what but my legs felt tired but you know you have those days and third place gets you on the team
6131107 coach didnt say too much to me before the race because he was trying to keep me calm and i think the nerves did get me a bit today but i made it anyhow im ready for the olympics amp lets try to make the finals
6131108 i think ill do a 3k maybe a 5 but the 1500 is a priority this year its what ive been training for
6131109 it was really windy out there so the pace was really slow i had to make two big moves to stay in place and that took a lot out of me
6131110 im in the best shape of my life ive taken good care of my body and am hoping for a long career now im going to focus on getting the world championships a standard for next year im hoping to run 4 05 this summer
6131111 im just relieved ive been chasing 4 06 all year and each time i hit 4 07 i get really disappointed so now im relieved to be done with this
6131112 i was the only one without an a standard to actually put it on the line im going to go to europe now to get a standard for next year so i dont have to put up with this crap again im sure it played out the way the a girls wanted they didnt have to do any of the early work im proud that i went for it i dont have any regrets i think i could have been up there if i didnt have to do all the work i wanted to go to the olympics not finish third and stay home
6131113 i really wanted to go out and set an honest pace but i kind of got boxed the whole time i didnt want to drop back but even when i did i didnt hold position i had a lot at the end which bodes well for the future getting fourth doesnt mean anything when you get fourth in 4 10 it was bad in that it went out so fast and then slowed down immediately it was inconsistent the plan was for lindsey and i to go out and try to make the a standard but it didnt work out that way

6131116 our proposed research will address some of the deepest questions in computer science
6131117 most people dont realize that ecommerce rests upon cryptosystems which in turn rest upon problems that we assume are intractable and cannot be decrypted
6131118 but is this true every time you do an ecommerce transaction how do you know that that hasnt been exposed to everybody else in the world understanding intractability will help better guide computer security efforts
6131119 in quantum computing and in other areas our model of nature seems to suggest that nature is solving intractable problems
6131120 we dont know whether or not this is a problem with our model or whether nature is doing something which we do not understand
6131121 there is a big open question as to whether the problems that we believe are intractable actually are if we discover that actually all these problems that we think are hard are not hard that would be an earth shattering discovery its hard to think of any other scientific breakthrough that would have more impact today
6131122 im speechless at getting these results i didnt expect to do so well in general studies as i didnt get as good a mark in the as levels in that subject as i did in the others
6131123 the predictability of the national media in questioning the validity of these results over the last few days is depressing
6131124 these students have worked exceptionally hard over the last two years for these results and they should be congratulated on them
6131125 this group of students are the first set to graduate from ormskirk school who have been right through the school since year 7 we are proud of them and wish them every future success
6131126 the studying was hard and it was tough motivating myself to do the revision but it was worth it in the end
6131127 we dont fight as there is no competition between us
6131128 we were happy for each other when we got the good grades and were going to do the same course at college
6131129 i am quite interested in stocks and shares and would like to dabble a bit at the moment but i cant really afford it
6131130 ive spoken to my mum and dad and they are really pleased about my results
6131131 i was giving blood the same afternoon as i got my results so going on the lash was probably not a good idea but i went out to socialise with my friends
6131132 i expected to get a couple of bs and i am normally quite negative when i go into exams i was suprised to get so many and im really happy i got into university
6131133 ive had these allergic reactions before and ive no idea what bit me i had to go to the hospital and now im on lots of pills so i wont be able to drink tonight but i am really pleased with the results
6131134 i was bored doing the same studies as other children of that age so my mum christine asked if i could move up a year
6131135 i was surprised i did so well in the exams i didnt get straight as in my as levels because my mum got married in australia so i had to take some time off to go with her
6131136 i got rejected to do veterinary science at university so im planning to work this year and re apply to do the course at the university of liverpool next year
6131137 ive always been interested in american culture and history and the course will give me the chance to spend a year in the united states
6131138 revising for the exams was hard but i am really pleased about the results
6131139 i was quite surprised by the results particularly as i had the tendonitis through too much typing and writing
6131140 it was really painful and the exams were really challenging as well so i was very pleased to get as
6131141 being in the bank has really interesting as i got to see how the business accounts worked
6131142 i was particularly pleased to have done so well in the french extension award as im studying french at university its nice to know im starting at a high level
6131143 ucl was the place i wanted to go and im really pleased i have got the grades to go there it has hit me as a bit of a shock now i am going from such a small town to a big city but im really looking forward to it
6131144 im absolutely over the moon with the results and it hasnt really sunk in yet that i am going to st andrews
6131145 i play some golf and i would like to play on the course but ive not really thought very much about what i will do once i get to st andrews
6131146 st andrews was my first choice because it was one of the best universities in the country and its a really nice place im really looking forward to starting
6131147 working out here has taken my mind off of waiting for the results and given me the chance to work on my spanish
6131148 i may not have been partying with my friends at home but i went out with some friends i have met out here who have been doing their a levels
6131149 i was particularly pleased to have passed maths as i seemed to struggle with that at the last minute and the spanish as i that is the subject i worked hardest on
6131150 i hope to specalise in mechanical engneering as i would love to work in formula one ideally with the mclaren racing team
6131151 i am an avid follower of grand prix racing and have also been to watch formula three racing at oulton park in cheshire
6131152 weve been going out together about 18 months and we have been able to help each other during the course
6131153 it was a bit stressful during the exams but we bounce off each other and have been able to work together quite well

6131232 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it

6131262 do you think the councils should accept this offer from government or not

6131267 i was only 11 when dad used to run to and from work and you dont take much notice at that age but to look back on all he has and is still achieving is absolutely overwhelming hes an inspiration to all of us
6131268 the findings of this report are unbelievable as well as being utterly wrong they are also insulting and show what london based tories really think of the north they seem to think we all live in terraced houses and breed whippets the laissez faire politics of the 80s ripped the guts out of oldham and it has taken 10 years to put it right

6131278 but you can talk about being ruthless and it becomes pretty wishy washy but its about how you become ruthless in terms of what we do as forwards how we complement what our backs are doing in attack

6131312 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings
6131313 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers

6131367 people are very upset when they realise they have harmed wildlife and in many cases it can be avoided
6131368 people should try not to trim hedges until late into the summer as many birds are late nesters and are still raising their young even now
6131369 when you do need to cut your lawn or bushes just be careful and check overgrown areas for any signs of wildlife
6131370 sadly there are many cheap and nasty bird feeders available now and people dont realise the damage they can do
6131371 buying them from reputable organisations such as the rspb and lots of other alternatives means the feeders have been tried and tested and accidents will be avoided

6131382 with its website hacked the georgian foreign ministry was forced to get a free blogger account to enable it to get information out we hope that this attacks will stop and it is extremely shameful that it is individuals who are perpetrating this actions
6131383 the attacks against georgias internet infrastructure began nearly two months before the first shots were fired according to security researchers who track internet traffic into and out of the countries

6131386 i do not think the russians are taking any notice in their current frame of mind they are likely to harden their position towards nato
6131387 if this is another factor which russia takes into account in making its decision to withdraw then ill be satisfied
6131388 it depends on what comes out because as we know russia controls the situation on the ground
6131389 natos impact is limited but it is not inefficient one reason is due to the fact that russian foreign policy is in a shambles at the moment

6131436 this is not an industry issue so far this is a games specific and company specific issue
6131437 in every industry there are winners and losers and right now the losers are getting smaller and the big guys are getting bigger
6131438 retaining those franchises and titles that are a strong fit with our long term product strategy
6131439 i think the risk of making a bad game is too great to justify pursuing some
6131440 the economics of making these games means that somethings got to give and the publishers dont want their profits to give
6131441 the size of projects is making independent developers who create large games more of a risky proposition especially if youre only working on one game
6131442 indies are tending to get more nimble in order to survive
6131443 with smaller budgets you get smaller teams but a smaller team is more efficient it can change directions faster and theres less waste
6131444 you can hide an awful lot of slacking in 100 million
6131445 i wouldnt say that were ever having it easy and not worrying about cost control and risk
6131446 that being said the game industry traditionally has been very boom and bust proof
6131447 for every studio that trims theres a hundred studios hungry to hire talent generally what were seeing is that one studio trims a bunch of staff and those people quickly get snapped up and absorbed into the rest of the ecosystem
6131448 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6131449 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6131450 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6131451 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6131452 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6131453 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively
6131454 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6131455 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6131456 it is unfortunate that ms blutcher viewed this visit as some form of retribution for my response to her misstatement in last nights planning council meeting ms blutcher stated that she had not received payment from the city of new orleans in five months i asked that she refrain from making inaccurate statements because i know that she received payments in late may as always these payments were made as reimbursements for fees expended and are based upon accurate timely invoicing from the vendor
6131457 when i made the statement at the planning meeting about not being reimbursed it was for this fiscal year 2008 2009

6131464 im not exactly all excited about the democrats but theyve got my vote this time
6131465 in the last few months notably the state has really been sort of going counter to the rest of the country
6131466 its just making it tougher and more expensive for me
6131467 im sure there are other places like this but its almost a part of me
6131468 but the economics are such that im almost certain that i will have to look elsewhere for work
6131469 its not enough to provide jobs and full time good jobs for everybody

6131482 the deployment of arab troops would only serve to consolidate the split between the west bank and gaza strip
6131483 you know that once the protection of the zionists is over people will enter your headquarters and kick you out
6131484 you must know we are not acting against you now in the west bank because we know the zionists will immediately back you
6131485 if the israelis dont resolve the palestinian prisoners issue soon and contemplate attacking gaza the palestinian resistance is prepared to not only defend the strip but also take the initiative and kidnap more soldiers who will never see the light of day unless a prisoner exchange deal is signed
6131486 the right of lebanon its people its army and the resistance hizbullah to liberate its land

6131505 we support the creation of this ufo trail because experts say that it is a hot zone for watchers
6131506 in no way can we guarantee that a tourist coming to san clemente will see a ufo
6131507 it was an orange object located about 400 meters 1 312 feet in the distance with oscillating movements
6131508 there sightings have been made of shining spheres going into the water and into wooded zones without any human explanation

6131519 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6131520 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6131521 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
6131522 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings
6131523 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6131524 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6131525 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6131526 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6131527 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6131528 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

6131533 it is a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before

6131535 weve finished our journey for the olympic games its a shame we were going to break the record for china at the olympics to take seventh or sixth place but we didnt make it

6131558 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home last year
6131559 you can be sure that were not stopping here the quest is not over until that bottom line number is zero
6131560 the statistics from this most recent study show that the efforts of law enforcement agencies to focus on the most likely causes of crashes such as speeding and impaired driving are making our highways safer
6131561 while we are pleased that overall fatalities have decreased we still have room to improve safe driving habits of truck drivers and passenger vehicle drivers
6131562 as these new statistics show we are making progress but far too many of our friends neighbors and family members are still getting killed or seriously injured
6131563 if you are wondering why the safety person is talking about mpg miles per gallon based upon our analysis our best drivers for mpg are also our safest drivers
6131564 slowing down from 65 mph to 62 mph is just not going to add significantly to your trip time

6131572 i believe that that is 1 800 people who would not have come forward otherwise
6131573 those 1 800 people got counseling medical care and assistance
6131574 i would go as far to say that the program is only as good as the sexual assault response coordinator
6131575 this is a command program and we have to have command support for this program to work

6131595 there are hundreds of thousands who have the option to buy coverage in the private market now that have failed to do so
6131596 he said theres no incentive for healthy young adults to sign up for coverage through a parents insurance plan when they can buy individual coverage much cheaper
6131597 regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn biological imperatives trump laws american government cannot fight against marriage and hope to endure if the constitution is defined in such a way as to destroy the privileged position of marriage it is that insane constitution not marriage that will die

6131605 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6131606 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6131607 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6131608 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6131609 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6131610 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6131611 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6131612 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6131613 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6131614 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6131615 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us

6131619 lalu prasad yadav had called me and was asking about the reported statement i told him that the statement was not anti bihari and was misunderstood by the media
6131620 after not winning the all around it hit me pretty hard not that i got the silver but just all my emotions came out i was training to win gold im just proud of myself that i kept my head up

6131626 earlier we had guidelines on how trials need to be conducted
6131627 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6131628 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6131629 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6131630 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6131631 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6131632 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6131633 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6131634 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6131635 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6131636 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6131637 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6131638 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6131639 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6131640 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6131641 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate
6131642 those terms are not the same as in the western world

6131644 the median waiting time for elective eye surgery in a public hospital was 69 days which was the longest of any specialty
6131645 we werent able to see why but it might be that there is a shortage of eye surgeons or that other types of surgery are seen to be more urgent
6131646 cataract surgery was less common among indigenous australians but eye related injuries were higher
6131647 only on my way here dolle phoned me to say this athlete tested positive the process is under way
6131648 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics
6131649 the ioc was very clear in the lead up we would work in concert with all the anti doping bodies
6131650 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see here the athletes know the ioc means business
6131651 i would love to see even more athletes involved in speaking out about not only what i believe in but what they believe in as well
6131652 i think that the games have run with amazing efficiency i believe that the chinese people are warm and have been generally wonderful hosts to the games

6131656 when you are defending 142 you try to stop runs and pick up wickets we tried different things and picked up wickets when we needed them
6131657 we were just one wicket away from making inroads into their tail but the partnership between dhoni and badrinath took the game away from us
6131658 the 60 runs they put together was the difference they batted really well in a situation like that you cant do too many things you have to stop the runs and attack as well but it didnt work for us today
6131659 that was our target anything above would have been a great score
6131660 we had to make sure we didnt lose too many wickets upfront keep wickets in hand and drag the game as much as possible
6131661 at the start of the series i said batting was the most important thing for us weve got to put runs on the board
6131662 we have good bowlers who can create opportunities but to do that we need to be consistent with the bat on a wicket like this you have to really struggle for your runs and work hard but we didnt dig in deep and fight really hard
6131663 the wickets are very fresh here because you dont play that much cricket throughout the year
6131664 whenever we play an international game the pitches always have something in it for the bowlers you cant complain its a good challenge for the cricketers theres no point playing on really flat tracks and scoring 300 runs we need to play on these kinds of wickets its just that it does a little bit with the new ball and then settles in once you get in its a very good wicket to bat on the ball comes nicely onto the bat and its got a bit of bounce
6131665 after the first game he had a tight hamstring so we gave him a day off on tuesday we wanted to have a fitness test today morning but he still had the stiffness so we didnt risk playing him in back to back games we have the champions trophy coming up and we didnt want him to pick up a serious injury

6131718 its been a long day today but weve found some important improvements in a few different areas so its been worthwhile and i am leaving here feeling very happy weve worked on electronics and it seems weve found some improvements under acceleration then of course weve worked a lot with bridgestone on both front and rear tires weve definitely found some good things in this area as well helping our agility and stability in the corners and we are faster with these new tires its been a good test and now we are looking forward to the final six battles
6131719 weve had a full couple of days testing and everyone has worked very hard with great results this is probably our last test of the season so its been very important for us to have this chance to check many small things especially tires electronics and setting we have had a long week here in brno but both the race and the test have been very successful and now were looking forward to misano
6131720 these have been two positive days because weve improved our performance a lot in comparison to the race at the weekend however we can not forget that we are still far from where we want to be so we can not give up we have tried a lot of new things but mainly tyres with michelin and we have been able to find some tenths now we have to work with san marino in mind because we really need to change our situation there and have a good race finally
6131721 as planned yesterday we have concentrated on testing rear tyres today following our work on the front yesterday from all of the michelin material we tested today we have been able to find some improvements and now we hope that they can provide us with these tyres for misano we still have work to do but motivation in the team is still high for the final six races and everyone still has the same goal to finish with some good races we know that jorge and the team deserve much better results than we had here in brno so we hope that we can turn things around in misano

6131731 this is a chance for something thats been a competition to actually be an ally if you will
6131732 if youve ever played air guitar more than likely you werent doing it to a michael jackson song you were doing it to an aerosmith song
6131733 all i can tell you about him is were going to get him in the game i dont know when but well get him in the game
6131734 he threw a couple of nice strikes into the end zone today and both of them were dropped
6131735 one of them by our senior receiver and one by a junior receiver
6131736 we see guys doing some good things and were also going to play some good things and were also going to play some three down players on the line but thats one issue thats yet to be resolved
6131737 i think hes going to be better than ok this year
6131738 in spring practice i was terrible to be honest with you flat out terrible i had no technique i wasnt used to lineman climbing up on me that fast
6131739 that zone defense require you having to know your job and trust the guy next to you to do his job
6131740 because if you try and do his job and you get beat deep its on you and not them communication is a huge key
6131741 theyll do that little swing route well be covering these petrino route systems crossing routes switch routes and then these backs will slip out a yard behind the line of scrimmage and get the ball
6131742 it wasnt the fans or the media that led to his demise
6131743 he wanted to go but we wanted to make sure he was fresh when we start preparation for appalachian state
6131744 the freshman quarterback continues to get better continues to compete and boy thats awfully important as you go forward if he continues that progress hes a guy that we can actually look to play at times
6131745 i felt effort was extremely good the teams in very good shape we ran extremely hard after and knocked it out we turned to a small number of mental errors weve got to get fixed
6131746 the longer this thing progresses the more it becomes such a wonderful problem
6131747 all those rankings and all those stars are nice but when it comes down to it they dont mean anything
6131748 my mom shes a warrior i admire her just for sticking with me throughout this whole thing my family too i definitely owe this to them
6131749 may they have opened something up its going to be a fun game this year i know coach urban meyer wants it bad
6131750 oh man it seemed to take so long but the great thing is that everything is all cool now and i can head that way i got the call and told my mom and we were both just very very thankful
6131751 no earthly idea what is going to happen in pap johns cardinal stadium on aug 31
6131752 it is a bad time for anybody to miss right now
6131753 defense you dont have to be too smart just see ball tackle ball
6131754 there is no simplified theres nothing simple we some technicians over there
6131755 everybody on the left side has great feet and great hands thats definitely why they have us on the left side with speed rushers and stuff
6131756 like i said these guys are awesome we have the best left tackles ive been around ever out here we have four of them its competition like none other
6131757 thats a minor thing fights during practice happen every once in a while
6131758 we had a good tempo everybody was concentrating very well i was very pleased
6131759 that group linebackers is playing with good energy and working hard
6131760 thats not the issue its just technique things and a little focus on tackling better secondary wise played pretty well for the scrimmage didnt give up anything huge but again the tackling situation showed up on the secondary on a few too many plays
6131761 im going to see how good a coach i am again ive got to go back to work now i told woody hes got to hurry up and get back this coaching is killing me
6131762 when theyre healthy and playing well things are a little bit different on both sides of the ball when theyre not its a struggle
6131763 were thankful a ligament was not involved and were glad peria will be back this season
6131764 weve had a bad injury bug to our defensive line this preseason fortunately we fell none of the injuries have been season ending and were looking forward to getting everyone back
6131765 if you have a great quarterback thats a blessing if you have one whos young and inexperienced like we do he just needs to go back there stay patient and play his game make the reads and make the best decisions we have talented players all around the quarterback and whoever it is all he has to do is go back and pick his poison
6131766 theyre battling theyre doing as much as they can learning on the job
6131767 i think it will take a little bit more recovery i thought they came out with pretty good effort and tried to practice hard
6131768 when hes in there at quarterback you know youd better get deeper
6131769 the best thing about ryan is his personality is such hell go do whatever it is you ask him to do hes got a great attitude and because of that hell have a good redshirt year
6131770 real real smart he kind of sees a lot of plays even before they happen hes big for jp i see he and john parker talking together a lot and they talk a lot about things mcelroy sees hes been great for jp and hes been good for us
6131771 a little uncertain in some regards about reading and getting the ball out of his hand but hes really a talented guy were working with him a lot and we want to continue to see him develop throughout the course of the year
6131772 i just really have admired his toughness his work ethic and he know those three freshmen coming in were very tough ive been proud of the way hes been pretty steady and hes got to keep going for us
6131773 im a nice guy off the field but when im on the field im angry receiver lionel breaux believes he got a new lease on life when ed orgeron was fired and nutt hired in oxford not to rain on the kids parade but did he ever see nutts passing offense at arkansas hed better hope kent austin has complete autonomy with the offense this spring linebacker tony fein was booted off of the rebels team for having a bad attitude and not going to class but a few days after said booting and after a one on one meeting nutt decided to give fein one more chance we wanted his mouth closed and his helmet to do the talking his attitude wasnt right and it carried over to the field
6131774 woody informed me last thursday of his physicians recommendation to have this surgery done at this time
6131775 i think both quarterbacks played well and i think both quarterbacks ran the team well
6131776 ive heard a lot of people say im in the doghouse or ive fallen out of coach miles good graces but nothing has really changed at all if something changed i think i would have noticed im still getting the same reps i always have and im running the ball in the same situations
6131777 it had nothing to do with academics an what happened went over the coaches heads
6131778 no team in the sec will ever go undefeated again
6131779 if petrino were to win five or six games this year i think that would be outstanding if he were to win seven games id probably vote him coach of the year in the conference
6131780 thats one guy ill tell you who did well hes not a big target but quarterbacks have a lot of confidence in him and confidence that he can make plays after the catch he caught passes and made 15 yard runs after that
6131781 at this point the offense as a whole is going to be extremely good one game it might be some guy making big plays and the next game itll be another we have so many different people to go to in this offense itll be a lot of fun
6131782 the good news is we made some big plays on offense today and john parker wilson was pretty precise with the ball he didnt throw any interceptions he didnt turn it over
6131783 terrence cody is a new guy that has made an impact in the middle he is a presence he can push the pocket hes difficult to block hes making a contribution in the middle no question about that especially on run downs
6131784 sometimes those ankles take a while we need to be careful he doesnt re aggravate it
6131785 we were very fast on defense looked like we were confident and knew what we were doing on offense we did not look the same way
6131786 we just keep piling on the information and he keeps eating it up hes a student of the game he loves to play it and im realy satisfied with his effort
6131787 he has the ability to put his foot in the ground and make a vertical cut tauren is really good at seeing leverage on a block and hitting the thing north and south and not bouncing things laterally and losing yards or running out of room

6131849 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6131850 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6131851 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site

6131946 everyone is confident about our quest for titles this season
6131947 i think the premiership will be decided between us and arsenal chelsea and liverpool
6131948 when we first heard about the opportunity to develop a game based on the original carrier command we were instantly hooked
6131949 for us carrier command was not only one of the most innovative games we had ever played but it is also one of the very few games that truly influenced our gaming tastes and motivated us in our own home grown game development which later materialized in the form of operation flashpoint with similar open ended gameplay and emphasis on a deeply simulated game world
6131950 having the opportunity to create an actual carrier command game is not only a great honor for us but it also allows us to take the legendary title we all love and do it justice with a truly next gen rendition
6131951 the gaea universe offers a realism and depth beyond the usual gaming conventions
6131952 gaea explores harsh consequences in our future from dwindling natural resources to the all too human talent for war and how those aggressive instincts can impact our first forays in space colonization

6131965 we have a full time marketing coordinator whose job is to communicate with friends its business to person marketing i think its almost disrespectful to e mail blast your marketing message wed rather go one on one with them its more relationship marketing thats what social networking sites are about
6131966 i think its just so new its hard to tell where the value is and how to leverage it i think most chains are taking a wait and see approach
6131967 most brands have social groups but its very difficult to engage them there is resistance among these groups to being advertised to they dont want to be seen as part of the marketing department
6131968 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever

6131980 the greatest treat in my opinion which can be offered to a human being
6131981 pigeons ensured themselves a healthy food supply wherever people were pigeons found fields of grains nearby a nicer situation than picking up berries and seeds from scrub bushes on windswept cliffs
6131982 we can call pigeons superdoves because of their outstanding success a superhero is simply a person who acquires special powers through some transformative event domestication gave pigeons the ability to become the superpower they are today

6131997 although extreme gamers are heavily involved with the industry they represent a small portion of the potential market for any new game that comes to market
6131998 in order to promote continued growth we must better understand all of the gaming segments
6131999 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

6132004 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6132005 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6132006 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6132007 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6132008 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6132009 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6132010 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe

6132012 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6132013 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6132020 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
6132021 health care costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6132022 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale

6132024 but less so to consumers given its likely high price
6132025 its been easily one of the worst seasons of my life and one of the best at the same time
6132026 training was going brilliantly and then i got an achilles problem in may that rendered me unable to run even 50m
6132027 ten days before the european cup i pulled my hamstring the doctor said it should be fine but in the race we got to 150m to go and i just could not respond i said this is not normal but they said dont worry its just a lack of training
6132028 i then ran at the trials got beaten and the same thing happened my body felt it was shutting down with 150m to go we did a blood test and found out my white blood cell count was 3 6 with the range being 3 5 10 and 3 5 being really low
6132029 that was the reason why i was running so bad and ive had two more hamstring strains since then but i was watching that colin jackson show about nature or nurture and i noticed how strong he was mentally no matter what happened and i thought do not give up on yourself mentally

6132066 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6132067 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6132068 shes doing ok the thing thats really been hard about it is being away from her with all the traveling we have to do
6132069 its tough but at least racing gives me something i can deal with something im having some effect on i feel blessed to have racing
6132070 those guys have made a good transition and when you think about it somebody who qualified fifth or sixth at a certain race last year well theyre probably 10th or 11th now with the same time
6132071 ryan only ran six races last year so this is really his first full year in the indycar series and he is adapting and progressing pretty much as we had hoped
6132072 his win at watkins glen gave him the confidence in his ability that he needed to run up front with these guys and he has certainly been every bit as competitive as we expected he would be
6132073 at the same time he continues to learn every week about the tracks and the guys he is running with so i expect he will keep progressing and become a title contender
6132074 the best thing about having a one car team is that as a driver you can make the team your own
6132075 we challenged ryan to do that at the beginning of the year and he has stepped up and done it
6132076 he has had to make some adjustments in his mind set to tailor his approach to racing on ovals and he has made huge improvements in that area he has consistently shown his ability to run with the top guys in the series and can be considered a threat at every track we go to which is something that is very hard to do week in and week out in indycar after the unification
6132077 i guess i could have gone home and sat on the couch eating twinkies or something
6132078 but theres no certainty in racing even when youre doing a good job after that i just got into anything i could drive a1gp nascar testing daytona prototypes i think i did pretty well in all of them
6132079 ive always had 100 percent confidence in myself that i could win given the right race car and indycar racings where i want to be im only getting started is how i feel
6132080 were not necessarily happy with those results just because theyre top 10s
6132081 something happened in every one of those races that kept us from getting a better finish and weve got to get past that

6132120 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6132121 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
6132122 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
6132123 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
6132124 that room was totally free with no monitors a flat out lie

6132126 a motorist survey this year by the rubber manufacturers association found that 85 percent of american drivers do not properly check tire inflation pressure this is an alarming statistic since tires are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road and a critical vehicle safety component
6132127 drivers across the u s can battle rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation
6132128 current statistics indicate that 82 million vehicles have under inflated tires which means more rubber is hitting the road and accordingly miles per gallon is lessened in fact tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas is wasted by u s drivers each year simply because theyre driving on under inflated tires
6132129 the chps traffic safety commitment extends to safety campaigns like these which aim to reduce needless fatalities and injuries on california highways
6132130 our research shows that this improper inflation issue has been prevalent for years
6132131 that andreas excuse for leveling accusation against mac you buy into that prfsr
6132132 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
6132133 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops

6132155 a few years ago one of my brothers left his position as a craneo facial plastic surgeon at a major hospital to devote the rest of his life to making a real difference in the world
6132156 he was here in the usa for a grand total of 26 days last year
6132157 there is an opportunity for the consumer to enjoy a great pair of premium denim jeans while making a substantial donation to this worthy cause with their purchase there is my opportunity to do what i love and provide a significant benefit in the process and the opportunity exists for the retailers to carry a brand in their stores that has a real story to tell to their customers
6132158 there are many worthy charities out there that are in need of funds to do good in the world
6132159 but this is one that i have first hand knowledge of and i am impressed with what my brother has given up to do what he is doing
6132160 in the future i will begin adding fits to the offering but i wanted to keep it simple the first time around
6132161 finish treatments bring out the real beauty of a great piece of cloth
6132162 ring spun multi dip denim is essential to making a great pair of premium denim jeans
6132163 i prefer finishes that have the look and feel of a great vintage jean that has had a life of its own real and natural
6132164 i am really thankful for this opportunity to do something that can help make a real difference in peoples lives
6132165 the sales of goods act covers products which are not fit for purpose for up to a year after purchase but this is handled by the retailer
6132166 and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains saith the lord god every mans sword shall be against his brother and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and i will rain upon him and upon his bands and upon the many people that are with him an overflowing rain and great hailstones fire and brimstone thus will i magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the lord

6132168 our position is that we are ready to cooperate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6132169 in principle yes we have not yet thought about it
6132170 on this issue we fully support russia the war which was unleashed by georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6132171 we oppose all these attempts as we think that this is a continuation of u s cold war era policy what russia has done is to defend its legitimate interests
6132172 georgia started the crisis but the west is blaming russia everywhere there is total disinformation distortion of facts and international attempts to isolate russia
6132173 the resolution of the important problems in central asia the caucasus and europe is impossible without russia i think that after the crisis with georgia russia has become only stronger
6132174 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6132175 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6132176 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6132177 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6132178 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
6132179 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
6132180 there is no point in signing an agreement at this point in time
6132181 we will review the agreement in light of the comments given by the supreme court justices and in the light of what is happening in mindanao
6132182 watering down the agreement will mean going back to zero
6132183 this could be a beginning of war if not properly handled

6132189 how come a whole building caught fire in an hour where are the fire alarms and where are the sprinklers
6132190 but in 1998 we managed to control the fire in the room it erupted in
6132191 we heard air conditioners blowing up and wooden shutters caught fire and flew in the air
6132192 we brought our extinguishers to be ready in case of the fire reached our building
6132193 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6132194 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
6132195 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
6132196 we need to quickly take those 600 idp internally displaced person centers and reduce that to a number that is more managable
6132197 the local government delivers food here they are bringing in bread and sausages
6132198 we are sick of it already but it is enough

6132203 we have a problem when a law abiding combat veteran is about to lose his job because the government has placed him on a terrorist watch list but refuses to tell him why
6132204 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6132205 we dont know how to live on and nobody talks about it
6132206 norway has noted that russia has decided for the time being to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6132207 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6132208 military naval exercises in the far east the mediterranean in the baltic
6132209 we wish to continue the cooperation with russia as far as possible but now the conflict with russia has escalated further its a quite demanding security policy landscape thats developing

6132217 i am not even thinking about a life beyond rangers you never know what will happen in your career over time but i want to be here
6132218 joe is one of the reasons behind matt lockwood being allowed to leave we have to give joe a chance
6132219 he did well enough last season to make us believe he will do all right for us it is one of those situations we need to give him first team experience but anything we do will be with an eye on him having a better future with nottingham forest
6132220 we want him to put julian under threat but the only way to get to that is to get a loan spell under his belt somewhere
6132221 he has shown his worth against morecambe now and people will realise that he can handle it
6132222 at this point were focused on building our organic strategy
6132223 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
6132224 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
6132225 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
6132226 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
6132227 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on google
6132228 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential
6132229 so sold out that microsoft japan actually put out an official statement about the situation in the land of the rising sun apologizing for the lack of consoles since demand has eclipsed supply microsofts supply has gone totally dry the company is ramping up production and the console will not be shipped to stores until next month

6132233 we need to educate people so they make the right decisions
6132234 keep your tires inflated to the factory recommended levels to get slightly better fuel economy
6132235 unless its a magic bullet that solves everything why bother
6132236 two weeks ago the presumptive democratic candidate for president of the united states barack obama had the gall to suggest that proper tire inflation could actually reduce national gasoline consumption thereby lowering our carbon emissions and reducing our demand for oil

6132244 boyd tinsley if memory serves wrote dave matthews band on this flyer for the show there was no time when we said lets call this band the dave matthews band it just became that and it sort of was too late to change when we started thinking that this could focus unfairly on me people sort of made that association but its really not like that
6132245 as a matter of fact thats one of the things about this band that everybody likes there isnt a leader each one of us can express ourselves musically without being choked by a leader everybody can offer what they feel is gonna enhance the music so yeah thats the main thing that all the guys especially me feel make this band happen its the freedom that we have to speak with our instruments
6132246 wanted to work on garnering a grassroots following and allow word of mouth to advertise the band and then build upon that

6132265 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6132266 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6132267 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment

6132387 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

6132473 dovrei stare con mio padre ma dopo unaggressione che ho subito ho deciso di andare da mia madre
6132474 lui non fa altro che associare i comunisti detto in tono dispregiativo sempre con droga spinelli alcol insomma una vita sbandata sregolata da non seguire mentre invece io mi trovo bene con il mio gruppo le nostre idee da quando io sono cresciuto sono cambiate io frequento un liceo che ha idee di sinistra invece lui detesta i comunisti

6132498 operaismo workerism has a paradoxical relation to traditional marxism and to the official labor movement because it refuses to consider work as the defining factor of human life marxist analysis assumes that what makes work alienating is capitalist exploitation but oepraists realized that it is rather the reduction of life to work paradoxically workerists are against work against the socialist ethics that used to exalt its dignity they dont want to re appropriate work but reduce it

6132507 first we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6132508 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6132509 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6132510 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6132511 on behalf of everyone at joe gibbs racing we apologize again for this most unfortunate situation

6132536 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6132537 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
6132538 its very important to realize there are a number of criteria that you use in tree selection and planting design what works for our soil types and climate on the delmarva peninsula may not be suitable for other locations
6132539 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
6132540 planting trees demonstrates that the poultry grower is being proactive to address potential concerns of neighbors gives the poultry farm a landscape appearance and increases property values adding the vegetative buffers also helps to reduce noise associated with farm operations

6132549 we studied the properties of disease causing viruses that evolved to infect mucosal surfaces to engineer a coating that enables our drug delivery particles to penetrate mucus layers in minutes in our new work we have improved the coatings considerably to allow faster penetration for a wider array of particle sizes
6132550 for example we constantly inhale particles into our lungs but they typically stick to mucus rather than penetrate it particles that stick are removed rapidly from the lungs on a mucus conveyor belt and are swallowed and sterilized in the gut mucus barriers protect us from constant infection as well as everyday things like the millions of particles in the black cloud emitted from a bus when it takes off from a stop
6132551 if a particle is small enough and not adhesive then it can get through the mucus net thats how some viruses penetrate mucus barriers
6132552 peg is one of the most widely used polymers for therapeutic applications
6132553 for example cervical cancer patients could locally apply chemo drugs inside mucus penetrating particles which would then deliver the drug locally in the female reproductive tract at efficient concentrations over prolonged periods of time instead of delivering it everywhere else in the body that could drastically reduce the side effects as well as prolong the presence of drugs at the target site
6132554 eventually we seek to engineer systems where a drug could be delivered to a specific tissue or set of cells anywhere in the body we want to make that possible

6132669 i got hit in the right temple by a line drive during a game i was in the icu for six nights and there were a couple of times the doctors were really concerned about whether i was going to make it
6132670 it took some time but it was mostly physical stuff the everyday repetition trying to get the mechanics down so i didnt have to think about what my body was doing when i was on the mound and i could just think about what pitch i was throwing
6132671 i started out with that streak and my goal is to have that not be the one thing im remembered for in baseball
6132672 i want to make this a lasting career and be known as a solid reliever not someone who just started out hot

6132681 alcoholism is understood as more of a disease now than it was back in my grandfathers day
6132682 the professionalization of the literary world has led to a less romantic view of writers in general
6132683 i suspect that a lot of writers today drink as much as their heroes and heroines but just dont advertise it since we live in a more politically correct time
6132684 when you dont have anything else to write about you write about being drunk
6132685 but now that the world is moving so fast there are a lot more things to write about so drinking excessively is not as popular or necessary as it once was

6132720 federal and state clean water mandates require both wastewater plants and farmers to reduce nutrient pollution running into pennsylvanias rivers and streams
6132721 while we were pleased the fair share coalition was able to secure funds for infrastructure upgrades we were disappointed the governor and general assembly did not provide any new conservation funding for pennsylvanias family farmers especially given the fact that agriculture is one of the largest sources of impairment to local rivers and streams
6132722 farmers have been hard at work reducing nutrient runoff over the last 25 years
6132723 when it comes to agriculture were dealing with thousands of small businesses with limited resources but we cannot afford to let other priorities continue to overshadow the needs of the farm community that faces a daunting challenge
6132724 for many farm families the problem is not that they dont know what needs to be done to make environmental improvements on their farms
6132725 the problem is having the technical and financial resources to implement the environmental improvements that are needed
6132726 conservation districts deliver not just state conservation programs but federal programs as well
6132727 the federal government has expanded the new farm bill to help farmers in the chesapeake bay watershed meet water quality mandates it would be a shame if the higher conservation funding levels within the new farm bill are underutilized because there are too few technical people in the field to help farmers qualify for the very programs the federal government has expanded
6132728 while we are pleased that additional funding was approved for wastewater plant upgrades that will begin to address pennsylvanias 20 billion in water infrastructure needs however agricultural operations must also be given the technical and financial resources necessary to allow them to achieve compliance with clean water mandates
6132729 pmaa is a strong supporter of the reap tax credit program and other farm conservation funding which provides incentives to farmers to implement best management practices and produce nutrient reduction credits
6132730 state government must use the limited funds available for chesapeake bay cleanup efforts in a manner that delivers the largest possible environmental improvements at the lowest possible cost
6132731 for those efforts to reach their full potential while at the same time protecting future economic growth increased agricultural conservation funding and reform of the nutrient credit trading program developed by the state department of environmental protection must also be approved by the general assembly and the governor these two initiatives in tandem will also increase the effectiveness of the new state funding available for sewage treatment plant upgrades

6132815 but its important to make sure when youre doing it that youre writing a story thats unique to yourself

6132820 the record industry is in a very different place than it was years ago
6132821 i admire people who have done interesting things radiohead created their own way to market their music its very important as an indie artist to be aware that you created this project you own your own publishing and you can figure out the best way to approach things so you end up benefiting without losing what youve created

6132835 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
6132836 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
6132837 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
6132838 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
6132839 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
6132840 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution

6132901 no es el momento no va de acuerdo con el buen esp ritu del d a nacional de la independencia si sigui ramos adelante con el concierto estar amos haciendo lo contrario a lo que deseamos para esta fiesta
6132902 the point of the 4 day work week is about doing less work its not about 4 10 hour days for the magical 40 hour work week its about 4 normalish 8 hour days for the new and improved 32 hour work week the numbers are just used to illustrate a point results not hours are what matter but working longer hours doesnt translate to better results
6132903 abba when we were in the desert you did not torment yourself like this
6132904 my son there we had solitude and quiet and poverty so i wanted to discipline my body in such a way that i should not fall sick for if i had fallen sick i would have needed assistance which i could not have upon mount sinai but now we are in the world where there are many opportunities of sin and if i fall ill there are friends who will help me and prevent me from falling away from a monks aim
6132905 near term demand for hot roles in it will be driven by the need for local and cross discipline knowledge changes in technology greater emphasis on managing risk and the enterprise and a limited supply of key roles
6132906 it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
6132907 you know lulu until i met you once i started talking quantum physics to anyone else the conversation shut down but you
6132908 sam i am going to put you in a car and send you back to drive through oklahoma again if that is where this song came to you
6132909 sam i think you should change this word to that in this song we at first thought he was serious until he started laughing and said
6132910 yup i bought 10 000 marbles on e bay and that is what happens when you have too much time on your hands
6132911 roi was one of the best human beings in the world and a buddy forever
6132912 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6132913 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6132914 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6132915 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6132916 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6132917 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6132918 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6132919 they want to know what were going to do about it
6132920 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6132921 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6132922 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6132923 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6132924 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6132925 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6132926 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6132927 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6132928 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6132929 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6132930 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6132931 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6132932 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked

6132950 dear annie i miss you and blah blah blah love bennie
6132951 i dont honestly believe that i can rehabilitate you gentlemen
6132952 you have an unshaken belief and i have heard not one word of repentance from any of you to imprison you would not deter others but would make you martyrs
6132953 that would set everybody in the community apart from society
6132954 the short creek raid sabotaged the trust women had in the outside world
6132955 theyd seen their terrified babies ripped from their arms uncle roy stood up to the state of arizona and won he credited the victory in part to the faithfulness of the women who believed they must be even more obedient to the prophet in the future
6132956 you get killed quicker in government doing your duty than turning your back
6132957 its an exact repeat right down to the way its playing out
6132958 if they fear us more than they do their abusers theyre never going to seek help
6132959 its this fear of government theyve been taught from the cradle see what happened in 53 if you seek help theyll come and take everybody we keep telling them no no no if someone needs help well handle that one case there wont be a raid
6132960 and now the polygamists are saying see we told you we told you it would happen again
6132961 the outside pressure from the government only reinforces their convictions
6132962 reinforces the belief that we are gods chosen people and we are going to be persecuted for living gods laws

6132964 the remaining 4 5 percent of the wheat area is still awaiting combine harvesters so total production will still grow

6132971 but when theyre in this virtual world this gets them to spend more time viewing your product its a little bit more sticky
6132972 its really a way to get shoppers to test drive your product
6132973 it casts a very modern current light on the brand with teens
6132974 some of these younger kids those younger than 8 and even kids up to 12 cant make the distinction between whats advertising and whats not
6132975 its fairly transparent kids are not very na ve these days
6132976 turned off by direct advertising were not giving away our product for free most of these items they have to purchase
6132977 they think that were right to try to encourage companies to focus on marketing healthier foods but they also believe they have the right to eat whatever they want
6132978 goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6132979 the world is supported by four elephants standing on a giant turtle
6132980 of course there is an endless pile of turtles one on top of another
6132981 the fire alarms were going off and i ignored it

6132988 the leading provider of entertainment that compels and inspires social change
6132989 my one concern before agreeing to accept their money and admittedly that came down to a decision on how to finance the movie was that they would try to put the message first i said look this has to be a character movie and not an issue film audiences want to see a good story and they dont want to be taught something
6132990 they couldnt invest money but they allowed us to take some pieces out of the museum to use in the film and shoot in the museum at a reduced rate

6133005 awal bulan hijriyah ditentukan melalui proses rukyatul hilal bil fili atau dengan melihat bulan sabit secara langsung pada setiap tanggal 29 penanggalan hijriyah bila bulan terlihat maka awal bulan akan jatuh esok harinya bila tidak maka jumlah hari dalam sebulan kemudian digenapkan menjadi 30 hari meski memang menurut metode hisab umur bulan ditetapkan hanya 29 hari saja
6133006 oleh karena itu kita akan menunggu sidang isbat di departemen agama nu akan menerima hasil sidang itsbat jika berdasar pada metode rukyatul hilal baik itu dilakukan oleh tim lajnah falakiyah atau tim rukyat departemen agama sendiri adapun hisab hanyalah pemandu pelaksanaan rukyat setelah pemerintah mengumumkan barulah pbnu akan mengumumkan juga setelah melalui empat tahapan sebelumnya

6133014 the guns style of musical expression features a core of early rocksteady reggae and pays tribute to old school ska
6133015 the band which has toured extensively through the midwest and will soon launch its first national tour showed great energy throughout its set featuring complex drumming often not found in typical three chord punk
6133016 this technology makes it possible to predict individuals responses to drugs and their risk of developing disease
6133017 our results conclusively prove there is a causal relationship between immunization schedules and diabetes
6133018 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes
6133019 parents of a child with a strong family history of insulin dependent diabetes should know that the administration of a full series of vaccines may have a greater than 5 percent chance of causing their child to develop diabetes

6133028 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6133029 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6133030 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa the commission risks delaying
6133031 comprehensive report into the market power of the baa monopoly and fully endorses its findings
6133032 competition works monopolies dont baas monopoly control over the london airports has been highly detrimental to competition and consumers
6133033 baa has long ignored the needs of its airline users and the travelling public and provided inefficient gold plated facilities encouraged by an ineffectual regulator the civil aviation authority
6133034 focus must be on ensuring that the current regulation of baas london airports is strengthened
6133035 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
6133036 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
6133037 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
6133038 i have a ton of stuff in my car and this is the second time ive come here and been turned away im going to have to go home and unload all this stuff again because i cant leave it in my car on whitelock overnight

6133042 in a world where conferences of hackers convene to share findings corporations and public agencies are always making security related changes and enhancements
6133043 the system is not flawed nor is the charlieticket the charliecard isnt at issue at all
6133044 we are changing the combination and adding more security enhancements
6133045 the first changes will be implemented before the end of next month with additional security enhancements to follow in the subsequent weeks and months
6133046 we are puzzled and disappointed by the mbta in trying to silence the messengers that there were these problems and vulnerabilities with the pay fare system
6133047 it would have been smarter for the mbta to embrace the research the students had done instead of clamping down on it they should have hired them instead of putting a gag order on them

6133058 we are very close kilinochchi is not very far from our sight
6133059 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment
6133060 they are doing a great job a great job i would say even though there are ups and downs the achievements are great
6133061 they did not have defenses in that area so they could not prepare themselves to face the military threat
6133062 theres some more to go other areas to get kilinochchi mullaitivu

6133067 prior to this change retirees had to have 20 years of active duty service or be retired at age 60 from the guard or reserve
6133068 if you didnt have 20 years you werent eligible however with the ndaa expansion if you are medically retired either permanently or temporarily and you have va payments that reduce your retirement pay you are eligible to apply for crsc
6133069 that way if you do not qualify and something in the law or department of defense crsc policy changes in the future that could affect the prior decision like the 2008 ndaa we will already have a claim and documentation and can reassess a claim based on the new eligibility factors
6133070 if you answered yes to those questions and have not submitted your crsc claim you should do so
6133071 the money is tax free and could help pay medical expenses or improve your quality of life
6133072 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6133073 its the job ive always talked about wanting after my playing career inside the nfl has been a staple of television for a long time the show digs deeper into the games and the issues surrounding the league more than any other football show out there i think this new approach will be fresh for my part i just came off the field and ive got 13 years of experience in the trenches to bring to the table
6133074 with his defensive perspective sapp is the perfect complement to simms and collinsworth
6133075 and having just come off the field his energy will help push the boundaries of the show to new limits we are thrilled to have him on showtime
6133076 warren sapp never held back on the field and we dont expect him to hold back in his commentary
6133077 football fans tuned in to watch him play each week we expect them to do the same each week to hear what he has to say
6133078 an administrative law judge has dismissed a complaint in which the dfl party claimed that the sponsors of two ads critical of senate candidate al franken were making false statements about a federal bill to organize unions
6133079 the federal legislation offers unions the option of being certified upon receipt of signed cards from a majority of workers in addition to the standard method of a secret ballot once 30 percent of workers petition for it

6133091 the central bank uses u s dollars to purchase afghan currency on the open market
6133092 this allows the central bank access to foreign currency reserves which are necessary to the legitimacy of the central bank in the eyes of the international monetary fund and the world bank organization
6133093 the more confidence we can build in afghan banks the more vendors will utilize them for payment via electronic funds transfers
6133094 this new process paves the way for u s forces to utilize private banks in afghanistan for commercial services this is vital because previously the central bank provided commercial services to our forces

6133097 the object was a few hundred meters up it was heading se and we just crossed paths
6133098 ha sido un trabajo muy bueno que convierte la f sica en algo divertido
6133099 i had a few bone fragments floating around in my elbow joint causing inflammation there were also bone spurs that needed to be removed it has been ongoing for a while it reduced my flexibility in the right arm and if it was extended too much it would swell up and be useless for a few days until the inflammation went down
6133100 so it was a priority to get it fixed as soon as this last fight was over which is what we did dr sanders and young operated on it in las vegas on july 10 and removed the bone fragments and bone spurs
6133101 mostly because i am training on it so much but should be completely healed within the next few weeks i have been doing cardio and some grappling but havent been able to spar for some time i am trying to be ready by november but its a safer bet to say i will be fighting in december
6133102 i want to fight top contenders i have already fought burkman and davis so i want to move up from there and continue to test my abilities against the best
6133103 i am extremely motivated and excited to get back in the octagon mentally and physically i will be where i need to be to return to the aggressive explosive fighter that i used to be
6133104 after the okami fight i was immature professionally and let pressure and other issues cloud my mind i know i could have fought better but didnt and it handed me my greatest loss
6133105 after this instead of making up for it with a better fight against burkman i let issues effect that fight as well and again was disappointed in my performance it was a tough lesson to have to swallow but it matured me as a fighter
6133106 the people of this village have been wary of the coalition forces for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
6133107 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
6133108 one of our main goals at this point is to put control of all future developments into the hands of the iraqi people
6133109 we want iraqi people in charge of iraqi projects using iraqi money and iraqi workers as soon as possible which will further stabilize the country and allow our forces to withdraw
6133110 no matter how big or small our operations might be we remain dedicated in our efforts to help the iraqi people gain a new life
6133111 despite the best of intentions it is impossible to change the minds of everyone but every little bit helps each new gesture that makes a difference is another step closer to permanent change
6133112 when i talk to my family and friends back home they want to know what its really like over here and if we are truly making a difference
6133113 each time i have explained to them the kind of change they have not witnessed yet battles and lethal operations have long ago ceased to be priorities our focus now is a return to normalcy living and working and interacting with the iraqi people positive changes are happening every day they might not be big or flashy but they are making lasting improvements that have already put victory for the iraqi people within their reach
6133114 the iraqi army is providing security with assistance from the coalition
6133115 people have been happy with the way we have been doing the security
6133116 for many customers the change will reduce the number of licenses they need to support their it systems increase agility and simplify the tracking of application instances or processors because customers now can count licenses by server farm instead of by server
6133117 conceptually the no time limit policy would be a boon to enterprises managing server farms and using virtualization as tool for server consolidation
6133118 but contrary to microsofts pro customer positioning the first benefit is to the company
6133119 opening the door for hosting providers to reinvent themselves as true clouds by lifting licensing restrictions microsoft lets hosting providers provision and decommission servers far more frequently allowing them to build true utility offerings around microsoft s servers and painting themselves with cloud stripes
6133120 this is a really big deal and both vendors should be congratulated on the work it took to make this happen
6133121 once the news is made official microsoft applications and operating systems will be fully supported on vmware based virtualization environments
6133122 cisco doesn t have any hypervisor so there s no reason to adhere this program
6133123 we are very close kilinochchi is not very far from our sight
6133124 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment

6133159 home buyers seem to gravitate to the kitchen first when theyre looking at a house
6133160 in a neighborhood where most homes have an updated kitchen remodeling a kitchen may well increase the resale value of the home beyond the cost of construction
6133161 if the goal of your project is to increase the value of your home for resale your project needs to reflect the neighborhood

6133178 i am pleased that vecs was able to provide both the buyer and the seller with the accurate information that they both needed to close such a large and complicated transaction

6133181 our second quarter results in the midst of the real estate market downturn demonstrate unique value
6133182 due to a combination of tight monetary policy and the earthquake in sichuan province real estate transaction volumes in most major cities were down substantially compared to the same period last year our ability to generate growth in transaction volume and value in this market condition further demonstrates our increasing market share and stronger leadership position at the same time our real estate consulting and information service revenue continued its strong growth which helped to deliver impressive performance in our revenues and profits
6133183 looking ahead to the third quarter of 2008 we expect conditions within chinas real estate market to remain challenging compared to the second quarter real estate transaction volumes for july and august in most leading cities will likely show bigger year on year decline this is because july and august of 2007 saw unusually strong transaction activities at the peak of the real estate market boom the 2008 beijing olympic games may have also caused a temporary slowdown in real estate transactions however we are seeing that many developers have adjusted their sales strategy in preparation for the peak season that traditionally begins in september by placing a sharp focus on increasing sales volumes and cash flows this trend combined with our continued belief that the long term fundamental demand for real estate in china remains strong provides compelling reasons for transaction volumes to rebound starting in september
6133184 during the second quarter we achieved strong revenue growth and stable profit margins despite difficult market conditions for the third quarter we expect to continue solid growth in revenue as a result of a larger number of projects sold by us and strong growth in our consulting and information service segment our asset light service oriented business model insulates us from the cash flow problems that many developers face during periods of slow transaction volume moreover a challenging market presents an ideal opportunity for us to expand our market presence and secure additional projects to support future growth
6133185 i was nervous about talking about the idea at first because it seemed so elementary a concept
6133186 it was very difficult to believe that nobody had thought of it before and i presumed that either it had been done already or there was some sort of snag
6133187 as i discussed the idea with colleagues however i began to realise that it hadnt been done and it was possible to achieve this trade off to improve vehicle suspension the next question was can it be done and once i had worked out what it should look like that was a fairly simple matter its very pleasing that what began as a theoretical idea is now being used in motor sport and hopefully it will gradually be incorporated into other types of vehicle as well
6133188 urban indian spending has risen by 35 per cent in the past two three years which is spent on entertainment and personal grooming given these trends it was imperative for reebok to provide greater choice to the consumer in the lifestyle space reebok classics is a sport and style fusion wear alternative terms to describe it could be sports fashion or sports inspired style

6133201 most high density condominium projects dont have a courtyard with the amenities found at the mark
6133202 this allows an uninterrupted frontage for the ground level commercial spaces along market street a design feature that further integrates the mark into its urban surroundings
6133203 many if not most people take vacations to other cities in order to experience their restaurants theatres parks and other amenities

6133310 i talked to a clinton delegate here in maryland he told me they have been instructed to vote for hillary for president on the first ballot to make things more interesting there is a movement to swing 160 delegates from obama to clinton if that happens clinton could re establish her campaign and face john mccain in the fall
6133311 the group p u m a for public unity my a claims that 15 delegates have switched from obama to clinton in july there is still the possibility of a floor convention vote to fully seat the delegations from michigan and florida which would benefit senator clinton
6133312 the question is will it be an easy nomination for obama or one of the grandest political ambushes ever pulled off on the voting floor of the convention
6133313 that depends on how the nsg exemption is worded and so we will have to see how that is worked out

6133319 children require a higher duty of care because they do not have an understanding of some of the dangers adults can watch out for making them more vulnerable to injury generally it is very important that adults properly supervise play when they invite children into their homes following some simple guidelines could prevent a huge number of accidents from occurring and help keep children safe

6133393 its pretty special to be swimming in an era where clearly the worlds greatest male swimmer is swimming and to be able to watch what hes been doing over the past week is absolutely amazing
6133394 sometimes he absolutely blew his opponents apart and sometimes he won by point 01 1 100th of a second it was absolutely thrilling to watch every single moment
6133395 i was very lucky to see his 200 freestyle world record i remember watching the same event at the worlds last year and i really thought that thorpeys ian thorpe world record would not be touched for a very long time until he swum sub 1 44 and at this meet to go sub 1 43 is absolutely amazing
6133396 it definitely stretches out the barriers it makes the impossible possible and decreases the limitations that we put on ourselves
6133397 i think that i have a lot more in me and i want to find that extra mile just like he has and he keeps on improving and progressing its absolutely amazing to watch

6133408 should people really be paying for something thats benefiting society
6133409 theyd jump on the bus raise holy hell then jump off two blocks later they got a big kick out of that
6133410 it has something to do with the question of value
6133411 when people pay nothing for something they just dont think it has value and they treat it as such
6133412 i have pretty significant concerns about transit vehicles becoming shelters for homeless people
6133413 i think we need to be most concerned about the quality of public transit not the cheapness
6133414 in terms of having a fare free bus system i think its important to have that vision but we also have to do the work to stop the attacks that are happening right now
6133415 it seems as though everything we put out there gets used
6133416 so while i am sympathetic to people saying that higher fares make it difficult for people who have low incomes were not seeing a big drop in ridership
6133417 vancouver has this terrible problem that all kinds of cities throughout the world would love to have which is people want to ride transit and youre simply not providing enough service
6133418 we dont have the capacity to expand our transit systems
6133419 we dont even have the money to keep them going
6133420 boy i rode in it just a week ago and it was a shambles
6133421 they may have discounted the fact that it was going to result in a lot more vandalism now theyre going to be paying tons to fix it up
6133422 allows metro buses to move more quickly but costs the city 370 000 a year the difference between the lost fares and the savings in bus speed
6133423 they dont seem to care about that because theyre getting away with it
6133424 this team has never faced this kind of pressure before theyve never been in a situation where you have to bring your a game every time you step on the floor

6133429 potential of the internet and other elearning methods to radically reduce energy consumption and emissions
6133430 the manufacture distribution and use of it equipment is responsible for around 2 of total global carbon emissions thats on a par with the airline industry
6133431 as an it company cobweb believes it has a responsibility to lead the way by reducing our own environmental impact and by working with our customers we can achieve even more that is what our new green community is about collective action that makes a difference
6133432 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too
6133433 as a hosted it services provider cobweb works hard to keep our environmental impact to a minimum we also help our customers to reduce their own environmental footprint by reducing the need to maintain energy hungry servers on their premises
6133434 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives
6133435 hoewel het dit jaar ingezette beleid van verticale integratie in de bedrijfskolom en de integratie van dico benelux in dico mobel gmbh in bremen tot een structurele verbetering van de resultaten leidt zal dit vanwege de vertraagde start pas in 2009 zichtbaar worden in de resultaten
6133436 in de definitieve cijfers is echter ten behoeve van de transparantie de verliescompensatie van circa euro 2 mln niet als actief opgenomen daarnaast werden vanwege het faillissement van een toeleverancier de vorderingen op deze vennootschap van circa euro 1 mln als voorziening opgenomen

6133449 the right to dignity does not necessarily extend to the right not to be named as a suspect once there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed
6133450 that mr zuma is suspected of alleged corruption is the truth it does not signify his guilt his right to be presumed innocent remains untrammeled
6133451 but there is no right not to be named as a suspect
6133452 the applicant has admitted that he had conversations with two judges of the constitutional court about the zuma thint cases his attempt to portray these discussions as a collegial interchange is unsustainable
6133453 elementary principles of judicial ethics preclude a judge of one division to discuss the merits of a matter with judges of the highest court in circumstances where judgment is still pending
6133454 on his own version this is precisely what the applicant did that with respect amounts to gross misconduct
6133455 with a view to the constitutional values of openness and accountability it was considered that the independence of the constitutional court and its deliberative processes would be best protected by a public disclosure of what occurred
6133456 it was felt it was particularly important to reassure the public that the public judges of the court are committed to protecting the integrity of the judicial process and will not even when circumstances may be difficult or hostile shrink from that commitment
6133457 given the sensitivities that have developed around this matter a court would not like any party to be uncomfortable
6133458 let me make it quite clear that i do not crib or plagiarise from mr trengove
6133459 you would be tying the hands of the jsc if your lordships grant it the declaration
6133460 there is nothing that can ever justify the conduct of the constitutional court judges he hlophe had a right to be heard

6133479 the mdc has not consented to the convening of parliament
6133480 a clear repudiation of the memorandum of understanding and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6133481 we believe that this will establish the psp as a viablecommunication device
6133482 foreclosure on wheels long beachs truck program puts drivers at high risk for default
6133483 the current sub prime mortgage debacle illustrates how many institutions profit by enticing minority and low income borrowers with schemes using too easy credit to finance purchases with loans they are unable to repay we ask daimlers corporate officials to show their commitment to socially responsible business practices by abandoning this risky dangerous venture if not for the sake of daimler shareholders and their companys image then for the sake of the truck drivers and their communities
6133484 instead of trying to help residents and workers a public government entity has outrageously teamed up with daimler mercedes to hoodwink the hard working drivers who haul cargo from our shores to americas stores
6133485 we believe that there is an undeniable link between clean air efficient port operations and fairly paid employee drivers achieving the environmental goals requires shifting the responsibility to where it rightfully belongs to a stable accountable and asset based trucking industry
6133486 these kinds of discriminatory loans wont just affect the thousands of californias port drivers as individual borrowers but entire families and their futures as well the companies that profit from global trade are in a financially more stable position to invest in the new clean technology we need to keep our communities healthy low wage workers arent

6133511 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6133512 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us

6133525 we need to educate people so they make the right decisions
6133526 keep your tires inflated to the factory recommended levels to get slightly better fuel economy
6133527 unless its a magic bullet that solves everything why bother
6133528 two weeks ago the presumptive democratic candidate for president of the united states barack obama had the gall to suggest that proper tire inflation could actually reduce national gasoline consumption thereby lowering our carbon emissions and reducing our demand for oil
6133529 the rules are simple dont die and go as fast as you can in that order as dying is an automatic disqualification

6133581 filing this ind marks a major milestone in development of delsites drug and vaccine delivery technologies it also represents the significant growth of our development team working from the basic research to pilot cgmp manufacturing and regulatory filing this also enhances delsites capability of drug vaccine delivery technology services by enabling a streamlined path to clinical studies for development of product candidates that delsite may provide to potential partners we believe that gelvac tm nasal powder represents a significant technological improvement in vaccine technologies and can bring significant advantages to the vaccine products
6133582 i believe the vaccine industry is undergoing a transition to a safer more user friendly delivery platform the needle platform system which has served mankind well and saved many lives has also created controversy over the perceived or real effects caused by heavy metal preservatives and adjuvants additionally the requirements for shipping vaccines cold or frozen as well as maintaining those conditions until administering have added expense and limited distribution particularly to those most needy in the developing areas of the world
6133583 i believe the gelvac tm platform facilitates the beginning of a true paradigm shift away from needles for the delivery of vaccines gelvac tm is a powder formula that can be self administered nasally using a unit dose device the nasal powder formulation needs no preservatives no adjuvants no needles and cold storage is not required since one kilogram of the gelsite r polymer in the gelvac tm formula can make more than 8 million doses the cost per vaccine dose can be significantly reduced delsite has one influenza vaccine that has been stable for over 3 years at room temperature naturally we are excited about the possibilities of our platform providing stable vaccines that can enhance distribution open up new markets and help prevent human suffering

6133831 let it not happen that the teachings and publications of jesuits contain anything to cause confusion among the faithful

6133895 foreclosure on wheels long beachs truck program puts drivers at high risk for default
6133896 the current sub prime mortgage debacle illustrates how many institutions profit by enticing minority and low income borrowers with schemes using too easy credit to finance purchases with loans they are unable to repay we ask daimlers corporate officials to show their commitment to socially responsible business practices by abandoning this risky dangerous venture if not for the sake of daimler shareholders and their companys image then for the sake of the truck drivers and their communities
6133897 instead of trying to help residents and workers a public government entity has outrageously teamed up with daimler mercedes to hoodwink the hard working drivers who haul cargo from our shores to americas stores

6133906 this issue is not just about how to cover the uninsured
6133907 it is much more about how do we hold down on health care costs for every american
6133908 our countrys ability to solve its health care crisis depends to no small extent on whether our political and private sector leaders can articulate a shared vision of the kind of health care system that will meet the needs of americans in the 21st century
6133909 there are indications that the elements of such a vision may be finally emerging
6133910 such a shared vision would have powerful potential to drive enactment and implementation of the health care reform americans need and deserve

6133915 training was going brilliantly and then i got an achilles problem in may that rendered me unable to run even 50m
6133916 ten days before the european cup i pulled my hamstring the doctor said it should be fine but in the race we got to 150m to go and i just could not respond i said this is not normal but they said dont worry its just a lack of training
6133917 i then ran at the trials got beaten and the same thing happened my body felt it was shutting down with 150m to go we did a blood test and found out my white blood cell count was 3 6 with the range being 3 5 10 and 3 5 being really low
6133918 that was the reason why i was running so bad and ive had two more hamstring strains since then but i was watching that colin jackson show about nature or nurture and i noticed how strong he was mentally no matter what happened and i thought do not give up on yourself mentally

6133930 i think what we see here confirms my observation that there is widespread disenchantment with the two major party nominees something that has simply not been adequately measured before this poll
6133931 there is a leaderless grass roots movement out there to boycott both mccain and obama in 2008 to make a statement to demand better candidates in the future from better parties this could be a historic election for non participation in a year with no high profile third party alternatives
6133932 progress with the constancia feasibility study has been very encouraging this has been complimented by the successful infill drilling at constancia which will be completed after a 25 tonne bulk metallurgical sample has been taken by drilling based on our latest projections we believe the potential exists for a material increase in the constancia resource which will contribute to an extension of the projected mine life beyond fifteen years
6133933 in addition to the impressive progress with the definitive feasibility study norsemont has completed the acquisition of the surface rights over four commercial farms at constancia this is of significant strategic benefit to the company as it provides us flexibility in relation to the location of the surface infrastructure although we enjoy good relations with the two communities in the vicinity of constancia ownership of the private surface rights enables us to minimize the impact on these communities
6133934 we have also been successful in increasing our mineral property position at constancia from the original 5 140 hectares to over 20 000 hectares as we have completed infill drilling at constancia we have now relocated a number of our drill rigs to a newly discovered anomaly to the south east of constancia where drilling is currently underway based on recent exploration success we believe the potential exists to increase the constancia copper resource to between 600 million and 800 million tonnes which would significantly increase the constancia mine life

6133964 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed

6133966 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia

6134078 in general asian americans are not likely to talk about their psychological problems
6134079 community practitioners notice that asian americans are less likely to self disclose their personal problems
6134080 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6134081 we can only speculate that it may be that a lot of these women are dedicated to family and they live long lives
6134082 without that kind of extended family older women may be more likely to commit suicide

6134121 in 2006 and early 2007 the industry many analysts and market observers were generally not predicting a downturn in the housing and credit markets to the magnitude of what has since emerged and outlooks for particular market segments at that time varied significantly
6134122 distracted by an accounting scandal and its fallout for much of 2006 the company was focused on a continuing effort to correct years of false financial reports a massive project that cost more than 1 billion and ultimately revealed that fannie mae had overstated past profits by 6 3 billion
6134123 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
6134124 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6134125 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything because im a federalist and believe in the rights of states
6134126 but at the same time theres already been discussion amongst the states and i believe that more discussion amongst the governors is probably something that everybody wants us to do
6134127 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
6134128 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
6134129 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
6134130 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
6134131 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
6134132 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
6134133 let me make one thing perfectly clear i would never advocate any course of action that would damage the state of colorados rights over the water or any other water resources that is going to be one of the most precious commodities for colorado and the entire west
6134134 i would never support any policy or any federal role that would impair the state of colorado or others states rights to their resources but i know there have been discussions amongst the governors i encourage those discussions as to how we best use a scarcer and scarcer resource in the west
6134135 the governor of california is advocating more storage but thats a decision that i think the state of colorado has to make and if the state of colorado wants it then i think we should see how best to finance it
6134136 in arizona weve had federal joint financing if its in the best of everybody certainly thats an option that needs to be explored but id like to see the state of colorado say that they need it first
6134137 nuclear has got to be a vital part of any solution clean coal technology is vital and i think we should invest a couple billion dollars a year in developing clean coal we have to pursue literally every alternative to our dependence on foreign oil

6134142 brazil certainly will assume all of the responsibilities for preservation of the amazon because we want to assume sovereignty over our territory there are a lot of people abroad that speak about the amazon as if they are its owner we are conscious of what the amazon represents for humanity and for brazil and that destroying it would be against our country and our products

6134146 ultimately we said wait a minute developers make money on the home and they sell their homes based on the fact that theyre in a certain school district
6134147 it changes their price point if buyers see it as a great school versus an average school many of us then began approaching developers and asking them for a donation
6134148 we try to remind the developers that they typically use our schools for marketing so its in their interest to keep our schools strong
6134149 this certainly is not going to meet the need but it keeps the need out in front of people because everyone knows this program

6134375 right now its very difficult to talk about collective projects of any kind whether its for the environment or big project like sovereignty
6134376 isnt that also including commercial use should pay a fee

6134380 the re animator crossover probably looks like a bit of a for the sake of sales kind of event but really this is a storyline thats really been worked up to for a bit and fully involves a lot of members of the h s cast
6134381 weve been sorta diddlin around with casss dad for a few years even so all of casss issues feelings and problems come to a head in these three issues
6134382 jack is a flawed guy very flawed and well see what makes him strike a deal with a guy like herbert
6134383 one of the things i always liked about herbert west was that hes never the hero of the re animator movies but hes not the bad guy either he exists in an interesting grey area an area that well see jack hack is pretty familiar with
6134384 west is a scientist first and foremost and ultimately his goal of defeating death is a noble endeavor
6134385 wests evil comes in his blind pursuit of his goal herbert would never outright hurt an innocent
6134386 in the h s crossover west will play the role hes played in the films anti hero villain protagonist and all around great character
6134387 though its fairly unnecessary to have seen that movie or really any of the movies if you choose to enjoy the crossover
6134388 personally though i recommend any h s reader treats themselves at least to the first film and the second one bride of re animator for sure
6134389 cass searching for her father after discovering a list of his new identities in issue 10 finds jack hack just as hes about to partner with herbert west in an experiment that cass and vlad will find personally interesting
6134390 threads we began at the very beginning of the ongoing all come to head here
6134391 poor pooch he knows the lords of nef aint gonna be happy that he didnt do his job
6134392 pooch is going to get his own issue coming up pretty quick where well see that pooch is more than just a creepy ugly dog thing
6134393 or maybe its right hell maybe thats what really happened and cass is the crazy one
6134394 i met alison when she was 14 right after ken irwin from
6134395 i ended up not producing the first record but playing on it and being kind of the floor director in the band trying to direct produce whatever it was
6134396 then i produced a couple of records for her and she learned so fast so much and refined her art of what she thought her voice could do how she should treat her voice and the material she should sing there was one song on the first record that we always gave her the business about something about whiskey on ice were like youre 15 years old you dont know what youre talking about i think that got her thinking like yeah i shouldnt sing songs like that i really dont know what im talking about so anything she sings she can relate to
6134397 its movies that are about more the domestic sphere more about relationships between characters family relationships and less about the whole political sweep of whats going on in the world

6134416 insights from artificial life could soon be helping run bts networks

6134449 stoppen op mijn hoogtepunt is altijd mijn doel geweest en ik denk niet dat ik nog hoger kan
6134450 es ist schwer nachvollziehbar was momentan am markt passiert deswegen investieren viele nicht und die niedrigen ums tze sorgen dann erst recht f r unverst ndliche kursbewegungen

6134461 these events are opportunities for students to become more thoughtful in the world arts and humanities are our teachers they illumine our way
6134462 they have emotional impacts that allow us to see and experience the world in different ways ways we cannot learn only through the news or in classrooms
6134463 students sometimes neglect one aspect of their total well being
6134464 its important to incorporate a balance between the mind body and spirit
6134465 there are plenty of healthy choices and opportunities in the restaurants on campus
6134466 most people dont and dont want to read about it everyday and unfortunately many americans have their own debt problem
6134467 basically our view was there is a need to state the facts and speak the truth to the american people
6134468 we learned so much from him im going to miss sam a lot
6134469 with will and mike mcdonald you knew the ball was going to be there every single time
6134470 i was a specialist in college and one of my closest friends is andy lee all pro punter for the san francisco 49ers ive been around special teams forever
6134471 you cant just kick to kick each kick has to have a purpose like the first kick at virginia or the first snap backed up
6134472 i have heard about people who come back from this in a short period of time and others in a long period
6134473 those three games last year really put me over the top confidence wise
6134474 if i ever doubt myself i can go back to the film and see the throws already
6134475 a couple of companies have expressed interest especially local companies
6134476 i think if there wasnt pressure they definitely would not have made gains in this area
6134477 its very clear that this progress at usc is very much related to the actions this entire community has put on usc over the last 10 years
6134478 no matter where theyre going representatives will have to meet requirements before moving in to clinical environments
6134479 our physicians feel that samples have a positive place in the treatment of patients
6134480 its a bummer because when i came in commons used to be the happening spot
6134481 i have to go way out of my way now
6134482 the building should allow activities to come back to campus that had previously been taken off because of the lack of facilities
6134483 we want being in our apartments to be like being on campus
6134484 students are eager to have more options more restaurants more stores more variety
6134485 we dont have any sit down restaurants or anywhere to shop and gateway will be able to provide that for us
6134486 if we want to learn each others traditions studying folklore is a good way to learn about the worldview of other people folklore ties into the direction of university tying to promote international understanding and give undergraduates experience with data collection
6134487 i would also see him in the tradition of emerson like emerson he uses his poetry to tell stories about things we believe
6134488 im from working class new england these stories speak pretty clearly to white males in the northeast
6134489 which makes the authors wonder if they listened to the words
6134490 unless you listen closely all you get is that anthem feel and the line born in the u s a its not exactly a happy tale and theres a lot of anger in it
6134491 i actually wrote a piece about that in the book
6134492 everyone can get co opted but i dont think he is when hes interviewed when he talks with fans he can be very down to earth he recognizes the money can be a problem and he uses it to good ends
6134493 the mayor wants to put them by schools and universities and places where there are congested intersections
6134494 the biggest schools with congested traffic are usc and ucla
6134495 there are many paths up the mountain but they all lead to the same place
6134496 as dean of religious life my duty is to serve the entire usc community not just uscs hindu students
6134497 i think the students will warm to him very quickly
6134498 the fact that i am hindu doesnt change the nature of my job but rather it is symbolic of an evolving georeligious diversity in the united states that is increasingly apparent on university campuses
6134499 the big thing for me was figuring out exactly how we were organized and who contributes to get things done
6134500 we really wanted to get the best people possible from the whole university so we really wanted to get this application out to as many people as possible
6134501 we really got a good mix of both experience from within student government and outside student government
6134502 i really scoured the campus for someone who i thought would fit in well with what i wanted to do and with the kind of quality id like to see in a vice president
6134503 its fun for me to be the go to guy and have people look to me to lead the practice
6134504 its a great opportunity for our high school guys to be able to have mark come back and teach them a thing or two
6134505 i totally trust him and believe he can be a really good player in our program
6134506 its nothing that he cant handle and hes already shown that to us
6134507 hes taken over that offensive leadership role in a really impressive way
6134508 we were only ever an indie rock band in the sense that we were a rock band on an indie label
6134509 thats something that people used to say to us in the early days even with scott pickering and chris burgess original bassist
6134510 its just lots of listening over and over in my head
6134511 i cant describe it its just like puzzle pieces finally fitting into place
6134512 those incidents emphasized the need to lock down buildings in emergency situations
6134513 under the new system we can lock a building down with the push of a button
6134514 previously it was an administrative burden to track down who had the keys to each building
6134515 card access makes the campus a lot safer if a member of the faculty or a student leaves the keck school of medicine we can deactivate their card rather than track down their key
6134516 because of the scope of the project we started at the hsc because it is a much smaller project
6134517 we need to be able to tackle one piece at a time
6134518 we know we have to take it game by game
6134519 our main goal is to win the pac 10 and go to the rose bowl every year since thats all we can control
6134520 what theyve done over the past six or seven years is remarkable
6134521 we had a terrific run with the kids who won championships but they left us
6134522 seeing the change of leadership we sensed a whole new excitement about our program
6134523 we envisioned all of these guys taking over and being stars when we recruited them
6134524 now we get to see these guys come into their own
6134525 its games like this that take us to the level that we need to be at every week
6134526 try and take something every day to get better at
6134527 you can never not get better at something theres always an area that you can improve on so thats just something that we try to focus on
6134528 secondary coach rocky setos got these guys understanding our system our principles our style of play
6134529 theyre physical theyre fast theyre big we have no reason to hold back on our expectations for what theyre capable of doing
6134530 theyre so committed to learning the game and theyre both on the same page how much they seek the knowledge to learn the game is what allows them to play in unison together
6134531 its not just the look its the walk the movements
6134532 non mlb post this might be going a little far
6134533 primitive man with his knuckles brushing the earth and his other hand stretched toward god
6134534 of course its hard to replace all those all americans
6134535 but were not really worried about it were looking forward not back
6134536 me and kyle are taking the reins and leading these guys by example
6134537 im very confident in our group and were doing one hell of a job
6134538 we have to love to be miserable thats coach holts favorite saying
6134539 once we teach the younger players that theyre going to carry that same thing and show the other guys after we leave
6134540 youve got to learn to love to be miserable and excel while being miserable and learn to play at an optimum level when you really dont feel like it
6134541 id like to play eight to 10 guys this year
6134542 i want 10 guys acting like they are number ones so i can play all 10
6134543 he just needs some quality reps when he comes back hopefully we can get him rocking for virginia
6134544 when jeff is out there it just adds another rock out there and keeps things in check
6134545 his communication level has gone up two fold hes barking out calls and directing traffic
6134546 last year he was a little tentative in that which most freshmen would be hes really taken ownership of the position
6134547 its a very very difficult statement for that family that they have to deal with
6134548 we feel very sorry for what they have to go through right now
6134549 he was found guilty on three charges and hes gotta deal with that and theres no way he can be a student right now
6134550 not even thinking about that right now hes got something hes got to deal with
6134551 its funny because i was reading lily allens comments about emi delaying her album and it made me laugh because were in a very similar situation
6134552 were waiting for emi to give us a release date as well but its looking like january for the single and february for the album
6134553 the band are just doing some mixing and then release dates will be confirmed
6134554 our manager ruth orabka went to school with phil and was in same music program at siu edwardsville
6134555 came in a couple of times during the first month and a half we were open
6134556 i thought it would be a win win to help us promote the night and get people out on a tuesday
6134557 phil passed on my idea to gene dobbs bradford executive director of jazz st louis and we all sat down and talked about how the situation might work
6134558 its a way for us to get our name out into the community to people that might not come down to jazz at the bistro
6134559 we feel that supporting and helping the local music scene grow is important to what we do at the bistro
6134560 weve talked about doing some special events with some of our residency artists
6134561 the thing that i love the most is when a trio comes in and then other musicians who know those guys come in and it turns into an open jam session you end up having music thats being created on the fly
6134562 wed really like to foster that community aspect if the tuesday night thing turns out to be a musicians hang then i know ive done my job
6134563 i thought for sure it would pass and then someone on the metrolink campaign made the decision to advertise that the train would connect mid rivers mall with east st louis
6134564 that pretty much killed it right there soon you had people saying metrolink riders would come to st charles by train and leave by car stolen car
6134565 i know its not politically correct but how else do you explain it
6134566 anyone can see all these people crossing brentwood boulevard from the metrolink station
6134567 most of them arent here to shop theyre here to hang out and cause trouble
6134568 its not as bad as it used to be on the weekends
6134569 but come here any weekday while school is in session it looks like theres an entire high school class here for a field trip instead of going to school they come to the galleria
6134570 what we do for the galleria is take them their employees and shoppers
6134571 with the loop incidents we and our passengers were the victims these kids arent traveling there by metro theyre coming by car or walking theyre not coming by metro
6134572 having the opportunity to swim that race was great for me and i swam well so there was definitely a big confidence boost
6134573 how are you going to keep all those tailbacks happy
6134574 they all have their own unique style which is pretty cool
6134575 as a team i want to go all the way thats my main objective
6134576 hes really just matured in the system it makes it so we can have a lot of fun in the offense with him
6134577 to not let the ball touch the grass thats the number one thing
6134578 im way more confident im not hesitant in my blocking or running ability
6134579 i know im the power back im not real shifty but i can make you miss
6134580 i might have to wait longer in line which will be a big issue especially since i have back to back classes
6134581 im concerned it might be too small to hold people
6134582 because i was in summer school there was nothing to eat on campus
6134583 i dont like to bring my own lunch to school
6134584 students are busy and active and this building has greater accessibility for that
6134585 continue to enhance and redefine usc hospitality so that we create the best usc experience as possible
6134586 people will be coming in from all different directions and its as close to the campus center
6134587 the lot will be an outstanding place to be before and during usc sporting events
6134588 students can study eat hang out and watch usc football
6134589 after losing or surrendering a license the animals became private collections which we have no control over
6134590 the usda does not have oversight of animals including big cats kept as personal pets it is up to the state to impose restrictions
6134591 any way you look at it from ensuring the well being of animals to public safety all agencies involved are failing miserably
6134592 we just keep list of caged predators and wild animals in the county as far as regulating we dont do that
6134593 were not prepared for private citizens owning tigers ive never understood what wed do if we had a major escape our officers arent going to get out there and use a taser to deal with a 400 pound tiger thatll just make him mad
6134594 these federal agencies do not know at any given time how many tigers actually exist in the united states
6134595 i know that our wide receiver position is vastly improved from last year to this year
6134596 i think the guys that are returning have gotten a lot better
6134597 we could have done a better job just making plays last season
6134598 i feel like we had an ok year but this year coming up we should have a big year
6134599 i think we were real young me and turner being starters i think we were both new to the field
6134600 last year we just took it in as a learning experience and took it game by game but this year there are no excuses

6134618 delegate service day grew out of a desire to give back to the denver community in a meaningful way and to highlight an issue thats important to our party national service
6134619 the response weve received has been impressive and im confident delegates who are strong leaders in their own right will return home to their communities and help to inspire millions of americans to lives of service
6134620 i am so pleased that not only denver is hosting the 2008 democratic national convention but am thrilled that we are holding the first ever delegate service day
6134621 denver and the west has a wonderful commitment to service and we hope that people from across the country will continue this commitment in their own home towns after the convention

6134855 he loved me i loved him and id give anything to have him back
6134856 during the 2007 nebraska state fair we had about a dozen military families schedule appointments to visit our mobile technology lab
6134857 psalm 69 the way to succeed and the way to suck eggs
6134858 i do not want a friend who smiles when i smile who weeps when i weep for my shadow in the pool can do better than that
6134859 no distance of place or lapse of time can lessen the friendship of those who are thoroughly persuaded of each others worth
6134860 true friendship multiplies the good in life and divides its evils strive to have friends for life without friends is like life on a desert island to find one real friend in a lifetime is good fortune to keep him is a blessing
6134861 friendship is unnecessary like philosophy like art it has no survival value rather it is one of those things that give value to survival
6134862 friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another what
6134863 i have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged their feathers are just too bright and when they fly away the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice still the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone i guess i just miss my friend
6134864 i have lost my seven best friends which is to say god has had mercy on me seven times without realizing it he lent a friendship took it from me sent me another
6134865 its wrenching enough to lose the man who is your lover your companion your best friend the father of your children without losing yourself as well
6134866 do not lose your best friend over your own stupidity
6134867 since there is nothing so well worth having as friends never lose a chance to make them
6134868 a good friend would bail you out of jail but a true friend would be sitting next to you saying
6134869 though we drifted apart in distance i still think of you as being right here and although we have many new friends it is our friendship that means the most to me
6134870 every human being must find his own way to cope with severe loss and the only job of a true friend is to facilitate whatever method he chooses
6134871 we do not so much need the help of our friends as the confidence of their help in need
6134872 if i had a rose for every time i think of you i would walk in my garden forever
6134873 every human being must find his own way to cope with severe loss and the only job of a true friend is to facilitate whatever method he chooses
6134874 yesterday brought the beginning tomorrow brings the end and somewhere in the middle we became the best of friends

6134938 this is a moment in history when it is vital for the worlds democracies to stand in solidarity
6134939 we had to play tough to up the ante there were some tough things said and we went through some tough times
6134940 this is the beginning of a whole new era for us were now partners at the table
6134941 it is with the greatest sadness that snc lavalin learned of a terrorist attack earlier today on a bus carrying its algerian employees to work on the koudiat acerdoune water treatment plant and distribution project in algeria
6134942 snc lavalin is proud of its longstanding relationship with the people of algeria and of the many projects we have carried out together over more than 30 years
6134943 we would like all our employees to know that we strongly deplore this act of terrorism and that their health and safety remains a top priority for the company
6134944 gathering comprehensive data about the dead from civilians is a time consuming task
6134945 we have to cross check data and check that people are not misidentified or miscounted
6134946 we have to make sure there is no double counting if a body is moved we have to be careful not to count it twice maybe it is counted once in the village itself and then it could be counted again in the city morgue
6134947 to get really accurate figures you would really have to go to every single village
6134948 we do take allegations of arrests of people missing or reported dead we can also offer our services to the authorities for the transfer of mortal remains
6134949 all the work we do is gathering confidential information which we share with the authorities with the aim of finding out the location of loved ones for the civilian population
6134950 there has been a lot of controversy about the russian figures
6134951 when that figure came out of 1 500 dead it wasnt very helpful it didnt provide any sourcing or methodology there were no details about how the figure was calculated we certainly cant confirm it
6134952 the problem here is that when russia puts out a figure like that it does two things it distracts attention from where there are violations and from the real scale of what is happening
6134953 if you have a military objective then the grad rocket is not a targeted weapon civilians are going to get hit and that is exactly what happened and happened on a significant scale the proximity was such that it was indiscriminate
6134954 a basic rule of the geneva convention is that whenever there is a shadow of a doubt that a civilian target might be hit then you dont fire
6134955 we have numerous stories of ossetian forces roving around ethnic georgian villages running around looting homes torching them

6134984 i don t know if it s going to be for these last two preseason games or for sept 7th the date of the regular season opener against the cincinnati bengals but i do know that when i m truly healthy i will be back on the field the ravens have compensated for gaithers absence by primarily using chad slaughter at left tackle with mike kracalik also getting a few reps on the left side the youthful but inexperienced offensive line could use a boost from gaithers return but the tackle said he is not pressing the issue i ve been pushing myself the whole time
6134985 there s added pressure anyway with a new playbook a new system just a whole new philosophy so i don t want to put any pressure on myself or my ankle

6134992 throughout the game i was trying to make adjustments to her japanese starter yukiko ueno pitches and try to hit what she was throwing instead of waiting for my pitch and stepping into the box that time she came with that first ball i took hard down the middle
6134993 then i knew she wasnt going to throw anything that was going to try to dance by me i knew she was going to throw at me hard and try to beat me with her speed knowing the last at bat she jammed me up and in so i knew she was going to go there again
6134994 well if i said it was a great ballgame it would be an understatement
6134995 there were two very good teams and you saw great pitching saw great defense great adjustments at the plate international tie breaker 20 second clock you really saw everything that the sport has to offer it was a tremendous effort on monicas part i thought she threw exceptionally well and gave us an opportunity to win the game

6135004 an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public
6135005 1 a public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public 2 circumstances that may sustain a holding that an interference with a public right is unreasonable include the following a whether the conduct involves a significant interference with the public health the public safety the public peace the public comfort or the public convenience
6135006 first a public nuisance by definition is related to conduct performed in a location within the actors control which has an adverse effect on a common right second a private party who has suffered special injury may seek to recover damages to the extent of the special injury and by extension may also seek to abate third a public entity which proceeds against the one in control of the nuisance may only seek to abate at the expense of the one in control of the nuisance these time honored elements of the tort of public nuisance must be our guide in our consideration of whether these complaints have stated such a claim
6135007 a corporation can bury their toxic waste in your backyard and when it winds up injuring and killing you and your neighbors sometime in the future that corporation is off the hook because they no longer control the hazard
6135008 under these circumstances we cannot say that the trial justice clearly erred when he found that the citizens group had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to show that the noise from the trucks constituted a nuisance
6135009 primed for lead paint litigation key rhode island case may color the future of the tort of public nuisance
6135010 in addition to trying to figure out a correct application of the common law an appellate court dealing with an issue such as the one in this case has to deal with many competing considerations including the impact of such a decision on future litigation how such a decision impacts those for whom such a development in the law is not predictable and many other related matters
6135011 i f a defendants conduct in interfering with a public right does not come within one of the traditional categories of the common law crime of public nuisance or is not prohibited by a legislative act the court is acting without an established and recognized standard
6135012 what is the most desirable resolution of this case and how can any impediments to the achievement of that result be evaded
6135013 it was the conservatives who applauded and the liberals who rent their garments
6135014 because there is nothing in the constitution on either issue
6135015 an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public
6135016 theres no question about it that the supreme court of rhode island has stopped any progress nationally to get justice for lead poisoned kids
6135017 we would reach a different conclusion but this is what the law has been and absent some very compelling circumstance were going to leave things as they are
6135018 stare decisis in reality protects all decisions except those that are obviously correct to all reasonable people over all time
6135019 stare decisis is usually the wise policy because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right

6135054 this type of a program is designed to be an antidote to the risky mortgages that have contributed greatly to the foreclosure problems seen in denver and throughout the country
6135055 the below market fixed rate mortgages and companion down payment assistance grants are meant to help address the needs of first time homebuyers who often find their only alternative to be loan products that subject the buyer to a greater likelihood of foreclosure
6135056 the largest barrier to home ownership many families face is lack of a down payment
6135057 the metro mayors caucus is pleased to continue our long standing support and encouragement of home ownership by providing a way for families to achieve and afford the american dream of owning their own home
6135058 of course this is a regional effort that wouldnt have such a broad impact without the involvement of the metro mayors caucus and the 16 participating cities
6135059 we are so fortunate to have so many lenders participating in the metro mortgage assistance program without the efforts of these lenders there would not be a program

6135275 for all of the above reasons the seven page document the court grants the injunction and prohibits agri cycle from receiving waste for processing at its facility until the defendants appeal of an administrative order issued to it by the director is ruled on by an administrative law judge or until agri cycle can demonstrate to the director or to the court that it can operate in accordance with the law and without posing a threat to human health safety and welfare whichever even occurs first

6135352 this richer view is particularly important because it clearly shows how blacks and african americans are not all the same just because they may be in the same age group or might be the same gender or live in the same part of the county

6135354 the most stressed by straddling the needs of family and work they are most likely to say they have been racially discriminated against in the past three months
6135355 network news exposure increased the endorsement of african american stereotypes particularly the view that african americans were poor and intimidating and was positively associated with higher racism scores
6135356 no matter which angle we use to view black people in america today we find them to be a complex and multifaceted people who defy easy categorisation we challenge culturally and politically an old group narrative that fails at the beginning of this new century to capture even a fraction of our rich diversity and heterogeneity

6135365 when we get to the point where the banks are selling more than they acquire then and only then will we be in a recovery mode
6135366 the banks dont have market share so they are going out and buying it to show that they have done something
6135367 the fact is every bank has finite resources and like any sensible entity would want to deploy its resources where it can make the most impact in terms of returns to the shareholders of the bank
6135368 i think anyone who would have expected a massive splash in the market upon entry is mistaken

6135386 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
6135387 are not and have never been after just small pieces of georgian territory
6135388 they want to demoralize my people and put them into panic

6135414 we had some hiccups in the no 4 with larry mcclure
6135415 im not sure there was enough due diligence when it came to knowing for sure if mr mcclure was going to have a car for next year we spoke with nascar and nascar said that that number was available and im not sure that all the way around that enough due diligence was done
6135416 weve been told that hes going to run some races next year and to us especially me as a car owner we know how much car numbers mean to teams and organizations even though nascar has given us that number for next year if mr mcclure is going to run a car were excited to have him back in the series and were glad to see him come back so we wanted him to have his number
6135417 this was a great opportunity to give ryan and his wife krissie a gift that we know would mean something and mean a lot to him

6135419 i know records are made to be broken but i dont think anyone will ever win 200 races again
6135420 thats one record in a league of its own someone would have to win 10 races a season for 20 years straight i just dont see that happening richard petty is going to have a long reign as king of that achievement
6135421 its going to take an outstanding driver and a phenomenal team and a few lucky breaks along the way but its not impossible
6135422 racing is more competitive than ever before but there are a few drivers coming up through the ranks that stand a real chance of winning multiple championships
6135423 it would take a career of near perfect seasons to win seven championships but a young driver who gets drafted into a top tier team could be a threat
6135424 i dont think it was my dream as much as it was my familys dream
6135425 i swam for 10 years every single day i would practice for hours at a time i would go racing all around italy i even had a picture made with mark spitz when he was at one of my swimming meets

6135427 i still go flat out all the time but in car racing we have yellow flags so we can catch our breath every once in a while
6135428 we changed everything on the car that we could to try to get it to run better

6135463 the greatest treat in my opinion which can be offered to a human being
6135464 pigeons ensured themselves a healthy food supply wherever people were pigeons found fields of grains nearby a nicer situation than picking up berries and seeds from scrub bushes on windswept cliffs
6135465 we can call pigeons superdoves because of their outstanding success a superhero is simply a person who acquires special powers through some transformative event domestication gave pigeons the ability to become the superpower they are today

6135473 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
6135474 it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig
6135475 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6135476 is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6135477 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
6135478 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
6135479 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain

6135498 locking both low income pupils and vocational education into second class status
6135499 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6135500 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses
6135501 there are many paths to success including vocational as well as academic options indeed 85 per cent of employers would encourage young people to take vocational qualifications

6135521 making it the first 80 20 development in brooklyn financed with bonds issued by the new york state housing finance agency
6135522 the new york state housing finance agency selected 80 dekalb to receive 109 5 million in tax exempt bonds and 27 5 million in taxable bonds the lending institutions involved in the transaction were wachovia bank n a and helaba both co agents providing the credit enhancement to the 137 million in bonds issued by hfa as well as the national electrical benefit fund which provided a 10 million mezzanine loan and 20 million of credit enhancement
6135523 it is a magnificent building at a great location that will provide both affordable and market rate homes we believe too that this is positive development during a tough market and points to the ongoing attraction of brooklyn as a place to live and work
6135524 its a special occasion and its got to be treated like that
6135525 if you want to get any silverware youve got to be incredibly consistent and beat all the big teams but in a shield game youve only got to get it right for 80 minutes
6135526 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
6135527 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
6135528 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
6135529 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
6135530 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
6135531 the advice from the security advisers is that the status quo remains
6135532 if anything musharrafs departure is a step in the right direction
6135533 the only tournament i want is with the best teams and the best players
6135534 of course people have fears and people have concerns and rightly so because there are things happening in pakistan
6135535 either you send your best teams or you decide that the advice tells you differently
6135536 public utility computing is absolutely the future of the games industry
6135537 but you have to understand the anatomy of whats going on in the game
6135538 where guys get in trouble is with 20 25 and 30 pitch innings cc has none of those
6135539 first i want to tell you why were here republican members have a plan to help bring down high gas prices unfortunately the speaker has refused to allow a vote on our comprehensive all of the above plan were not asking her to pass it just let us have a vote
6135540 70 of our oil comes from other countries because democrats in congress have walled off drilling for oil in the outer continental shelf and oil shale in the inner mountain west
6135541 our plan is simple all of the above that means more conservation biofuels renewables like wind and solar as well as increasing american energy production
6135542 why dont we take care of ourselves why do we expect saudi arabia to take care of us we send 425 million everyday to saudi arabia because were afraid to drill
6135543 the time has come to reassemble congress and decide whether or not we are going to start taking care of ourselves
6135544 the message from voters in north carolina is clear they want congress to do something about gas prices they want congress to do something about our dependence on foreign oil
6135545 everyone is frustrated about high gas prices but nothing is being done we need some action
6135546 in pennsylvania the head of public transportation says the cost of building roads has increased 73 percent its not just about moving to alternatives its about whether or not we will be able to move our economy forward and keep jobs
6135547 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
6135548 i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6135549 use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election
6135550 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6135551 times are tough and getting tougher its hard to save its hard to retire
6135552 when i saw that motorcade come down the cul de sac i couldnt speak i couldnt swallow within a couple minutes he put us at so much ease
6135553 im just a poor railroader ive got a small house and a family im trying to raise barack and michelle can relate to that because of their upbringing
6135554 barack obama has been a very strong champion of equal pay for equal work senator mccain over and over again has opposed the opportunity for pay equity bills to move through congress
6135555 theres no question that women in michigan and kansas all over this country are going to be critical voters in this election
6135556 they control the purse strings they are the economic engines of their family
6135557 so were hopeful that that the international tournament will become opportune for them as well when we first raised it with them it was met with a great deal of interest that needs to drill down to a yes
6135558 at the moment it looks as though we have seven australian teams and formal invitations have gone out this week to all of the new zealand national league teams
6135559 there is still a chance that we could win the tri nations and we want to go out there and play positive rugby

6135564 but we do need to be more accurate at the breakdown situation
6135565 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6135566 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6135567 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
6135568 but he was playing solid he waited for his opportunities and when they came along he made birdies he was always in control of his game
6135569 its more for us to get it right and make sure were better because we can be better than what we were
6135570 weve worked hard on our application this week shifting the ball a lot quicker and being more mobile
6135571 it was a tough night for karl hes put his hand up but i think around the park we didnt show enough there werent enough options

6135573 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
6135574 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6135575 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6135576 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such

6135580 as a trial lawyer edwards had ridden the frustrations of the poor to fabulous wealth but one could never be sure that as a politician his populist spiel wasnt part of a plan for further self enrichment he seemed to love money too much

6135595 the club has been carrying on talks with tottenham hotspur at the request of forward andrei arshavin on the possibility of his transfer in line with our agreement the british club was to forward its proposals on the issues that the sides failed to agree on at an earlier stage however at present zenit has not received any these proposals
6135596 taking into account the forthcoming closure of the transfer window on 31 august the current uncertain situation does not allow the club to seek a replacement for arshavin therefore zenit must consider the issue of his transfer to tottenham closed

6135649 more than a week ago gov linda lingle released 1 225 000 for the installation of a new playing surface on the clarence t c ching athletic complex formerly known as cooke field two days later rmy construction was announced as the low bidder at 862 381 uh said but later that day a protest was filed by co ha builders according to documents released by uh
6135650 rmy did not submit a responsive bid as required by the hawaii procurement code
6135651 award the project to the next lowest responsible bidder provided for in the procurement code
6135652 the protest letter is under review by the uh legal counsel and uh procurement office and until thats done all work has been suspended
6135653 prior to the protest construction was to have begun this month and been completed by oct
6135654 my concern is for the athletes that would use the field the faster that we can get it replaced the more benefits for everyone that uses it from my perspective anything that delays the process is highly irritating after all it is all about the students

6135658 the vehicle was flipped upside down about 15 meters from the hole itself which was about 5 feet wide and 2 feet deep

6135662 he cant really fix meals he cant take a shower anymore by himself
6135663 i cant play catch with my son and i cant go shopping with the girls very easily so theres a lot of changes the kids have gotten more used to now
6135664 but still they wish the old dad was here which i understand i wish he was here too
6135665 theyre not eligible for the same benefits as amputees are because they havent lost a limb but in my husbands case he lost the use of his left arm so whether its there or not there he cant use it
6135666 i watched my daughter go to prom last week she looked beautiful it was a really nice moment that i could have missed

6135677 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6135678 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6135679 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6135680 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6135681 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6135682 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6135683 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6135684 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6135685 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6135686 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6135687 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6135688 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6135689 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6135690 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6135691 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6135692 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6135693 we cant spend the rest of the day running up and down the beach if our suspicion that hes going to do something tonight is correct hell be plotting something against one of us or against kika and i dont think hes going to try anything before ten at night
6135694 because based on his previous behavior we are acting on a somewhat fantastic hypothesis our suspect likes constructing scenes we must therefore allow that it is plausible that he is going to build some sort of grand finale today precisely christmas night so far nothing has contradicted our hypothesis according to that logic we must conclude that if hes going to try anything hes going to try it at night at dinnertime at the meridien
6135695 so am i i think the way you talk is fucking amazing
6135696 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6135697 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6135698 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

6135705 en qu situaci n quedan ahora todos los planes generales que la junta ha rechazado al aplicarle la ratio de 2 7 estamos ante un caso en el que se demuestra la doble vara de medir de la administraci n auton mica con unos ayuntamientos y con otros
6135706 en qu se basa este gobierno municipal para cifrar esa ratio en 2
6135707 el psoe de jerez no responde a muchas otras inc gnitas como por qu el ayuntamiento llev al pasado pleno la aprobaci n del plan sin todos los informes sectoriales necesarios dicen que lo har n para la segunda aprobaci n por qu para entonces
6135708 una aut ntica desfachatez que el equipo de gobierno hable de retrasos en el pgou cuando lo aprob hace dos a os y luego lo ha paralizado llevado a pleno otra vez luego otra vez precisamente por su indecisi n e inoperancia por su incapacidad para sacar adelante un proyecto de tanta envergadura y sobre todo por los a os que lleva el pgou jerezano sometido a los continuos cambios por los caprichos de la alcaldesa o no sabemos qu tipo de acuerdos el plan lleva tanto tiempo estancado
6135709 al equipo de gobierno no le importe contar con el apoyo de la oposici n
6135710 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6135711 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6135712 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6135713 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6135714 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6135715 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6135716 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6135717 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6135718 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6135719 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6135720 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6135721 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6135722 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6135723 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6135724 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6135725 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6135726 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6135727 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6135728 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6135729 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6135730 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6135731 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6135732 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6135733 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6135734 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6135735 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6135736 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6135737 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6135738 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6135739 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6135740 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6135741 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6135742 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6135743 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6135744 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6135745 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6135746 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6135747 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6135748 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6135749 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6135750 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6135751 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6135752 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6135753 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6135754 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6135755 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6135756 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6135757 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6135758 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6135759 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6135760 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6135761 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6135762 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6135763 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6135764 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

6135781 they are very badly written but i can see why they are popular
6135782 members are advised that the official opening of the first session of the 7th parliament by his excellency mugabe will take place on tuesday 26 august
6135783 in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of the parliament
6135784 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the mou and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6135785 it is their choice provided they will not participate in parliament business chosing of the speaker and the deputy speaker before they have taken the oath of loyalty
6135786 if there are any members who do not attend that is their choice
6135787 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6135788 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6135789 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6135790 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6135791 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6135792 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6135793 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6135794 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6135795 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6135796 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6135797 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6135798 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6135799 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6135800 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6135801 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6135802 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6135803 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6135804 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6135805 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6135806 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6135807 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6135808 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6135809 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6135810 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6135811 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6135812 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6135813 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6135814 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6135815 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6135816 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6135817 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6135818 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6135819 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6135820 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6135821 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6135822 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6135823 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6135824 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6135825 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6135826 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6135827 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6135828 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6135829 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6135830 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6135831 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6135832 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6135833 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6135834 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6135835 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6135836 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6135837 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6135838 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6135839 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6135840 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6135841 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6135842 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6135843 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6135844 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6135845 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6135846 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6135847 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6135848 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6135849 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6135850 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6135851 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6135852 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6135853 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6135854 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6135855 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6135856 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6135857 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6135858 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6135859 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6135860 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6135861 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6135862 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6135863 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6135864 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6135865 this is a planning took where all things are going
6135866 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6135867 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6135868 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6135869 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6135870 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

6135880 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living

6135883 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6135884 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6135885 i feel like digging a whole and burying myself in it right now

6136141 if you are to write on religion then you are supposed to touch on matters pertaining to questions on rituals adherence to god followers and anything related to your divine mission
6136142 if you go beyond that definitely you have committed some breaches
6136143 u ltimately the interpretation of what constitutes religious matters should be left to the leaders and adherents of the faith
6136144 in line with the teachings of the catholic church in social and political charity
6136145 the home ministry is not in a position to dictate to the catholics or for that matter the proponents of any other faith the scope of their religion
6136146 in seeking to control the contents of the herald the home ministrys warning and show cause letters go against article 3 1 article 10 1 a and article 11 3 a of the federal constitution that is the right to freely practise ones religion the general freedom of speech and expression and the right of a religious group to manage its own affairs
6136147 such controls will deprive the catholic community of current information and education in relation to their faith such an act by the authorities is tantamount to curtailment of religious freedom
6136148 nothing more than the fulfillment of acts of worship and the observance of a few moral obligations
6136149 the dichotomy between the faith which many profess and their day to day conduct
6136150 no matter our national racial ethnic economic or ideological differences we have a global commitment to love our neighbors and to work for justice
6136151 we also have a commitment to work towards a just even and fair development of our world where no one society is exalted materially above the rest and no other society is left quite literally in the dust development must respect the rights of all nations and their people always promoting the moral cultural and spiritual dimensions of each person
6136152 good news to the poor liberty to captives and new sight to the blind
6136153 t he members of the church as members of society have the same right and duty to promote the common good as do other citizens christians ought to fulfill their temporal obligations with fidelity and competence they should act as a leaven in the world in their family professional social cultural and political life
6136154 international conference on religion in the quest for global justice and peace
6136155 in broadening public understanding of religion and its role in promoting justice and peace
6136156 our religious education should convince us that the dignity and integrity of all human beings is worthy of our respect religion should inculcate a truly universal and inclusive outlook not a mentality that is narrow exclusive and parochial
6136157 the need to amplify the role of the media in promoting a universal and inclusive dimension of religion that focused upon justice and peace
6136158 journalists and media practitioners in general should deepen and broaden their understanding of religion in order to play a more effective role in advancing the universal values of justice peace and compassion which lie at the heart of our great religious philosophies
6136159 those who organised the forum are non muslims and how can they talk about something like that this has hurt the feelings of the countrys muslim population
6136160 if you are to write on religion then you are supposed to touch on matters pertaining to questions on rituals adherence to god followers and anything related to your divine mission
6136161 if you go beyond that definitely you have committed some breaches
6136162 transparency and open government crosses ideologies and is equally supported and equally opposed by both major political parties
6136163 the coburn obama bill of which both senators barack obama and john mccain were initial sponsors requires federal government contracts to be posted at usaspending gov ohioans deserve the same type of transparency from their state and local governments
6136164 false publicity aggravated fraud endangering lives and inflicting involuntary wounds

6136184 the convention for the suppression of unlawful acts of violence against the safety of maritime navigation
6136185 it clearly wants to persist with this programme and is seeking to deter other activists from disrupting its hunts
6136186 sticking interpol on the activists is unlikely to deter committed anti whaling campaigners
6136187 i couldnt believe it you have to stay focused right until the very end and now i am just really happy
6136188 i am annoyed that the fastest time that i posted was in the last round when i was competing for third place and not before
6136189 i also made a mistake earlier on that was completely avoidable
6136190 it has been a tight competition all summer but i am hoping that this will now heap some pressure on hannes
6136191 but i have to say that he is flying beautifully at the moment
6136192 were wrapping up the process of assigning numbers and are shooting for friday of this week to begin sending correspondences which will take a couple of days to hit members email addresses
6136193 its not really fair to put them back on the list
6136194 theyll have to get to the back of the line
6136195 i think this process was good for people who really wanted to be on the waiting list
6136196 well just have to wait and see what tomorrow holds for it so ill wait until the morning
6136197 sometimes they come back very quickly and sometimes they dont sometimes it turns into a deep bleeding thing and were hoping its not that
6136198 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
6136199 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined
6136200 obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
6136201 this maybe will stop some of the whining going on
6136202 i just didnt want to get into these daily progress reports
6136203 ive done nothing but rehab i guess were sort of in the rumour mill now
6136204 obviously i favor senator obamas energy positions and democrats have been by and large the more forward leaning actors
6136205 but john mccain has the best record of any republican running for president on the energy issue and on climate change
6136206 im very encouraged about where the presidential rhetoric is in this campaign
6136207 by this point in our argument some are probably feeling impatient
6136208 scientific ignorance if it is not ignoring or deliberate denial or dishonesty is perhaps pitiable but not morally blame worthy you dont have to be wicked to be stupid
6136209 the main reason people deny that morality must or even can be based on metaphysics is that they say we dont really know what reality is we only have opinions
6136210 but the very fact that we argue about it a fact the skeptic points to as a reason for skepticism is a refutation of skepticism
6136211 if you didnt see this then you dont deserve to understand my opinions
6136212 are persons a subclass of humans or are humans a subclass of persons
6136213 the possibility that there are nonhuman persons like extraterrestrials elves angels gods god or the persons of the trinity
6136214 traditional common sense and morality say all humans are persons and have rights
6136215 modern moral relativism says that only some humans are persons for only those who are given rights by others i e those in power have rights
6136216 to be pro choice you must deny at least one of them because taken together they logically entail the pro life conclusion
6136217 but there are three different kinds of pro choice positions depending on which of the three pro life premises is denied
6136218 the moral premise is that all humans have the right to life because all humans are human
6136219 i would not engage in homosexual intecourse therefore no one else should
6136220 from the pro life point of view there are only three reasons for being pro choice scientific ignorance appalling ignorance of a scientific fact so basic that nearly everyone in the world knows it moral ignorance appalling ignorance of the most basic of all moral rules or legal ignorance appalling ignorance of one of the most basic of all the functions of law
6136221 a scientific fact so basic that nearly everyone in the world knows it
6136222 if you believe an unborn baby is only potential life or a group of cells then you do not believe you are killing a human being when you abort and might have no qualms of conscience about it
6136223 most pro choice arguments during the first two decades after roe disputed the scientific premise of the pro life argument
6136224 it might be that this was almost always dishonest rather than honest ignorance but perhaps not and at least it didnt directly deny the essential second premise the moral principle but pro choice arguments today increasingly do
6136225 perhaps pro choicers perceive that they have no choice but to deny the moral principle for they have no other recourse if they are to argue at all scientific facts are just too clear to deny and it makes no legal sense to deny the legal principle for if the law is not supposed to defend the right to life what is it supposed to do
6136226 i think most people refuse to think or argue about abortion because they see that the only way to remain pro choice is to abort their reason first
6136227 why it is more restrictive to give life than to take it i cannot figure out
6136228 in objective fact of course either it is or it isnt unless the court has revoked the law of noncontradiction while we were on vacation but in our subjective minds we may not know what the fetus is in objective fact we do know however that either it is or isnt by formal logic alone
6136229 a second thing we know by formal logic alone is that either we do or do not know what a fetus is either there is out there in objective fact independent of our minds a human life or there is not and either there is knowledge in our minds of this objective fact or there is not
6136230 in case 2 where the fetus is a person and you dont know that abortion is manslaughter
6136231 it would save me and other pro lifers enormous grief time effort worry prayers and money
6136232 the young of an animal in the womb or egg esp in the later stages of development when the body structures are in the recognizable form of its kind in humans after the end of the second month of gestation
6136233 i think you could say that about the groom as well
6136234 stimulation of the mind or emotions to a high level of feeling or activity
6136235 i think hell is being in the absence of purpose
6136236 when i had no purpose no direction i actually felt like i was living in hell
6136237 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
6136238 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing

6136248 the u s was not involved in that raid it was an element of one of the iraqi special operations forces do we support it in principle absolutely not
6136249 it was what appears to be a rogue operation its definitely concerning that we have an element that would go do something like that

6136260 the people in the bar because it was coming up on halloween were thinking it was a devil cat or had evil powers or something
6136261 but we kind of liked yoda better and barfly lasted only about a day
6136262 he is perfectly normal hears well energetic cute little cat
6136263 we always let the cats go outdoors but this one was so unusual we decided we didnt want to do that
6136264 so we had him chipped and we keep him inside
6136265 they come over and he comes running to play with them
6136266 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
6136267 transcendent challenge of our times which the likely gop nominee often follows with a vow to chase osama bin laden to the gates of hell if thats what it takes to capture the al qaeda leader sends precisely the wrong message to potential terrorist recruits

6136271 in general asian americans are not likely to talk about their psychological problems
6136272 community practitioners notice that asian americans are less likely to self disclose their personal problems
6136273 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6136274 we can only speculate that it may be that a lot of these women are dedicated to family and they live long lives
6136275 without that kind of extended family older women may be more likely to commit suicide
6136276 although we dont have good statistics yet we believe that many asian american students are prone to feeling depressed over a lack of achievement
6136277 eastbound and down loaded up and truckin were gonna do what they say cant be done
6136278 one thing helping treasurys out is the performance of the dollar
6136279 people arent looking at the rearview mirror on inflation or the yield on the 10 year would be well above 4 right now the inflation concern has moved away a bit
6136280 inflation pressures may have eased slightly but more important is the outlook for the economy
6136281 it will remain weak the situation in housing will pressure economy well into next year
6136282 in this environment treasurys could do well for people looking for safety
6136283 if youre taking money out of the commodities market and looking for a place to put it treasurys would be it
6136284 there is the potential for further downside in yields but most of the fears are already priced in even though the troubles in financial sector will remain
6136285 there will be more write downs but they are no longer the surprise they once were
6136286 there has been a renewal of uncertainty which therefore leads to fear regarding financials in general that said the level of fear is less than its been before

6136312 after devouring many polls and talking to friends it was apparent that many glbt people were unaware of the stark differences on our issues between barack obama and john mccain

6136430 companies and investors alike compile analyze and produce information and reports electronically with the move to an electronic data based filing system the sec will not only keep pace with the markets but will provide investors with a dynamic system they can use to get the information they need rather than having to wade through an avalanche of paper forms legalese and doublespeak

6136437 also america is no longer a place where citizens care about plagiarism or hair plugs a biden pick would immediately elevate obamas gravitas give him a semblance of humility delight the media and reassure the nation that a grownup is involved democrats would be simultaneously relieved and apprehensive but theyd be pleased with the choice overall plus biden is catholic is a washington insider in a good way a hardworking man of the people unchanged by three decades inside the beltway and has a tragic history with a happy ending

6136490 the formation of vegetable mould through the actions of worms with observations on their habits
6136491 before anyone was doing it on the worm farm they would trench long rows and layer them with food scraps and manure when these dried a bit theyd add the worms after the sun went down remember the worms have no bones no skin to protect them from acid in the food so i always dried stuff first

6136496 we have already achieved the millennium development goals for halving water and sanitation and we are well ahead of our target to achieve universal access by 2014

6136499 south africa is extremely well placed to host the next event after turkey in 2009 as this would bring the focus and all the activities of awareness to africa and in particular to the southern hemisphere
6136500 if you are to transform a nation you must attend to some basic things first and that is why water and sanitation are so important
6136501 madagascar is fully aware of how important water sanitation and hygiene are to health community development and even to the economic development of the nation
6136502 more than the number dying from malaria measles and aids combined
6136503 do you think children in america or sweden die because of diarrhoea or bad drinking water no it doesnt happen in the 21st century why should it happen in africa
6136504 we are not talking about something as complex as building a rocket to take people to the moon we are talking about teaching children to wash their hands with soap to use proper sanitation techniques and about improving access to clear water for villages
6136505 and we are not talking about designing the latest computer we are talking about helping people to drill wells and use water pumps and collect rainwater on their roofs
6136506 all it requires are common sense strategies a little creativity and the wisdom to use proven and effective strategies used in many countries around the world

6136509 theres a lot more computing power thats not exposed apple s os 10 is a powerful mature operating system but theyve shut off a lot of features due to fears over how it runs on this mobile platform theyve got to expose more of that power a lot of the interest from legitimate device management security and business application firms will only help with the maturity of the operating system
6136510 so were in a frozen state until apples exclusive deal with at amp t mobility also limits corporate options still fails to meet some fundamental enterprise centric requirements that many of its competitors provide
6136511 but if i were in charge of an enterprise considering the

6136541 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6136542 i agree mrmnmom82 i mean the guy that inhaled vicks
6136543 yes sure im watching at night when i have the time
6136544 but he watches during the day and tells me all the latest news
6136545 its the 100th day after his death today and the whole family is still overwhelmed
6136546 to us nothing is interesting and nothing will ever be fun again
6136547 of course im watching its chinas games why shouldnt we watch
6136548 people have to make a living we cant just sit around all day
6136549 ive got a factory job during the day and a peach orchard to tend every evening
6136550 its peach picking season right now so there are so many things to do sure i watched the olympics opening ceremony and i care about how many gold medals china wins but frankly i have no energy for the games
6136551 we sell this to the candy makers and get a good price for this
6136552 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals
6136553 in some breeds they are paying a terrible price in genetic disease
6136554 the welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration
6136555 any dog may be shown but it is up to the judge to decide if it fits the breed standard
6136556 it is when characteristics become exaggerated that health problems can occur
6136557 far more faithful to history than the stunning film 300
6136558 the group continued to report stable business development in the first six months of 2008 as it maintained extensive yet in depth cooperation with domestic as well as international mainstream carriers
6136559 competition in global telecommunications continued to intensify during the first six months of 2008 as top flight international carriers and equipment makers sought to capture new market shares in their respective domains
6136560 meanwhile the trend of mobile communications expanding rapidly at the expense of fixed line business continued
6136561 my group has been investigating what we believe is another taste quality calcium
6136562 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6136563 but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6136564 many animals have a specific calcium appetite which implies they can detect the mineral and consume sufficient quantities of it to meet their needs
6136565 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6136566 the pwk strain drank about four times more calcium than water
6136567 we can now say with some certainty that calcium is tasted
6136568 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6136569 hopefully we wont have to be sitting by as somebody dies to wait to chop their tongues off were not ambulance chasers there are cases where people have cancer of the
6136570 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
6136571 tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6136572 theyre high rent professional carrie bradshaw doppelgangers who have a lot more sex and cash
6136573 atlanta georgia manufacture of cotton seed oil atlanta georgia the commercial center
6136574 i think in respect of georgia its very significant that in may nato committed not just to georgia but also to the ukraine that they would join other formerly so called captive states of the former warsaw pact in nato and what were going to agree today is a special mechanism that will bind nato and georgia together a nato and georgia commission that will take forward that commitment to georgian membership
6136575 we must make clear that georgias aspiration to be a member of nato remains alive and well the alliance should offer georgia a clear pathway to membership
6136576 the whole trick here was to start at the bottom point of the economic cycle and assume that any subsequent improvement was the result of his policies of course this is a ludicrously forgiving measure over time the economy tends to grow and it also goes through cycles to point out that were better off at the peak of a cycle than at the trough is something that could be said of any economic cycle bush was claiming his miracle fertilizer succeeded because his plants were taller at the end of the summer than at the beginning of spring
6136577 the problem is that carbon monoxide is an insidious gas
6136578 the driver who took over did not realise he had been affected until he left the cab and was in fresh air
6136579 until the situation is sorted out properly it is not safe for passengers or our members
6136580 the diesels have had fume problems for some time still have and now queensland rail has responded by issuing gas marks
6136581 but drivers have told me that if they smell anything in future they will just stop the train where it is
6136582 world fuel prices have reached record levels in recent months and in the marine transport sector the scale of the increase this year has been quite exceptional
6136583 the steam packet company has absorbed much of the increased cost over the last few years and since march this year has already absorbed several million pounds in extra costs which it cannot recover

6136590 los maceteros de la calle jos benlliure ya se olvidaron hace mucho tiempo de las flores de pascua que los servicios municipales depositaron en ellos en las navidades de 2006 y desde entonces nadie se ha preocupado de reponer
6136591 en algunos casos son los propios vecinos los que se encargan de ello
6136592 el compromiso del equipo de gobierno en el fomento del deporte y de dotar a la ciudad de los mejores recursos para permitir a los vecinos un acceso de calidad a la pr ctica deportiva
6136593 gracias a una serie de acuerdos los centros educativos ceden el uso de sus instalaciones deportivas en horario extraescolar y as permiten que grupos de actividad f sica para adultos o clubs deportivos para su entrenamiento puedan disfrutar de estas canchas de baloncesto voleibol o gimnasios

6136597 our position is that we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6136598 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle

6136602 i shudder to think what would have happened if alicia had taken any she could have died i contacted the pharmacy to tell them what happened and they demanded the methadone back
6136603 i intended to take it straight to a lawyer but they insisted on having it back and the criminal investigation unit was sent to my home to collect it
6136604 in the worst case scenario she could have been seriously ill and her breathing may have stopped
6136605 giving a child a dose of methadone intended for a drug addict is very bad news

6136609 whenever anyone asks why invest in china the answer is very simple thats where the money is and its where exponential future economic growth is also
6136610 the bank of china boc conducted a study of the effects of 12 olympiads on their host countries over the course of 60 years they found that nine of the twelve olympic host countries suffered a decline in gdp growth in the eight years after the games
6136611 the key to a post olympic slump is the size of the economy
6136612 china has made one of the largest investments ever in the olympic games with some estimates of spending topping 40 billion but we dont believe the capital city will go into a slump after the games
6136613 in fact beijing has been forced to defer other infrastructure projects during the run up to the games those and other pressing projects are expected to take up the economic slack in the city after the olympics
6136614 further thousands of factories have been shut down temporarily in the region surrounding beijing in an effort to reduce air pollution during the games also somey 50 of beijings automobiles are being taken off the roads and many heavy diesel trucks are being banned from the city
6136615 nationwide the effects of this economic event are likely to be absorbed by the immense momentum of chinas economy
6136616 among individual stocks china mobile has been in a holding pattern pending the beijing olympic games government regulators have ordered all telecom companies to refrain from signing up new subscribers until the games are over
6136617 its a highly unusual request but beijing says its a necessary move to prevent service disruptions due to increased loads on networks in chinas fast growing wireless communications sector
6136618 with more than 407 million subscribers china mobile retains an excellent reputation and has added as many as 6 million new subscribers every month thats an 87 share of the new subscriber market and a 69 share of the total market
6136619 china mobile appears set to gain exclusive access to the much coveted apple iphone in china in current negotiations
6136620 this top dog in chinas mobile phone scene has a pe multiple of 22 with a solid dividend yield of 2 29 considering its ongoing growth we see the company as attractively valued with a target sell price of 100
6136621 the children have kept me going after i do playboy we want to try ivf its asking a lot but if its possible it would make our package complete
6136622 deus me livre e guarde de maluf muita cara de pau desse homem

6136626 nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on what is just and right
6136627 if it had to be done again i would do it
6136628 the work you are doing here is vital i say that to your comrades in europe because there are soldiers from the whole of europe here
6136629 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6136630 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6136631 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6136632 we should not make precipitous choices because of this drama we must redefine the mission and set precise goals
6136633 if the aims are just are the tactics being used to achieve them correct
6136634 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer
6136635 ya besok kita akan kirimi surat ke dpp pkb sesuai dengan alamat yang diterima kpu

6136646 i feel like i look more pregnant than you do and i am not due until september 1st
6136647 oh yay congratulations wow im due august 3rd what about you
6136648 first we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6136649 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6136650 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6136651 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6136652 on behalf of everyone at joe gibbs racing we apologize again for this most unfortunate situation
6136653 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
6136654 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
6136655 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new bloomberg poll obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counseling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
6136656 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
6136657 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
6136658 especially since they deserted me for the messiah seriously hill that paris britney ad you came up with was brilliant i owe you
6136659 his secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde
6136660 he wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers but he doesnt want to be seen as a glib pretty boy
6136661 if i do say so myself while the rookie was surfing in hawaii i ate his pupus for lunch pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while im pushing around putin priceless
6136662 i have a little secret to tell you about that john bill made it happen he loves you so much he called putin and told him that if he invaded georgia he could count on being invited to the clinton global initiative every year for the rest of his life
6136663 wow should i call him i saw your husbands kind words about me in las vegas on monday saying id be just as good as obama on climate change
6136664 hes still boiling at obama and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women weve spread the word in the feminist underground as opposed to that wacky obama weather underground that catharsis is code for no surrender my gals know when i say we may have started on two separate paths but were on one journey now that skinnys journey is to the nearest exit
6136665 we are pleased to provide our customers with the unprecedented ability to stay connected to their family friends and business associates on the ground via the internet while traveling at 30 000 feet above the united states
6136666 they came at us hard from the first whistle it is obvious that this team is aggressive motivated and looking forward to their season
6136667 thats a good result yeah we wanted to win we always want to win but i was pleased with your defensive performance
6136668 its a great achievement but as owners we see ourselves as facilitators its important to remember weve had some fantastic chefs
6136669 initially there was a lot of keeping tables open in the restaurant when we could have filled them with drinkers
6136670 now weve developed a trusted position with wellington diners and thats a great position to be in this is a whole new challenge for us the challenge was getting to this point but now peoples expectations will be higher than ever
6136671 we are fortunate enough to have a loyal and loving clientele who have evolved with us over the years and allowed us to do what we love
6136672 the arrival last year of chef sean marshall to matterhorn lifted this restaurant from good to excellent it is now not only a premium destination in wellington for a great time but also for seriously good food
6136673 a tuna sashimi style starter left us moaning for more such was the intelligence of the combined ingredients and quality of the fish
6136674 ultimately it was a dining tour de force from go to whoa with energy wit and a superb sense of its own identity stunning produce unpredictable combinations fresh thinking and thorough craftsmanship were the hallmarks of every dish
6136675 fresher better tasting food that has no need of too much work or excess garnish
6136676 the sense of anticipation and excitement is building every day for the inaugural red bull indianapolis gp
6136677 the organization and effort by the community surrounding this race is very similar to that during the month long celebration of the indianapolis 500 every may this will be a memorable world class event for riders in every way
6136678 indianapolis is ready for all the exciting events surrounding the red bull indianapolis gp
6136679 weve worked hard to create and sustain our citys reputation as americas premier sporting events destination this week long festival celebrates that reputation coupled with everything about motorcycles
6136680 there arent enough police to make enforcement work in a significant proportion of the city
6136681 isnt the federal government talking about lowering speed limits to help fuel economy
6136682 why are there so few cars in this rendering they should have made it far harsher
6136683 i just went out and bought kelly and eriks book now all i need is a patch of earth to
6136684 the saddest part is i believe that the dr didnt doesnt and wont ever think he
6136685 i didnt test yesterday because olivier was evaluating various different parts on my machine however we have managed to achieve quite a lot during todays track time we focused mainly on setting up the bike to suit a front tyre option that weve not used so much but has been put to good use by a few other bridgestone riders recently previously weve not been able to make this tyre work effectively but with the changes in chassis set up weve made it is now a viable option for us to use in the race this weekend i had to push hard every lap to be fast but with the advances weve made at this test the bike feels much more rideable im now really looking forward to furthering our improvements next time out
6136686 the last two days have been very useful to us and weve gathered a lot of data we firstly worked with our base chassis setting to see where we could make adjustments to improve the stability and balance of the machine we also had a new swing arm and some electronic components to test today which have both brought interesting results this track is quite grippy so its difficult to see exactly where this puts us with regards to some of the other circuits but i am confident that weve made many forward steps we now need to spend time reviewing the data to assess fully everything weve evaluated in the last two days
6136687 we have mainly evaluated different engine and chassis settings at this test along with some new specification components for the ninja zx rr it was unfortunate that john was unable to ride because of the injury he is carrying but weve gathered a lot of data from both olivier and anthony weve definitely got a new direction with the machine and both riders have seen improvements with the set up of their bikes throughout the time they were on track anthony made adjustments to his chassis set up and adapted his riding style to suit a particular front tyre which hopefully will now be an option for us to use in the future we will now refer all of the information we have gathered back to the factory so we can continue with our development
6136688 its been a long day today but weve found some important improvements in a few different areas so its been worthwhile and i am leaving here feeling very happy weve worked on electronics and it seems weve found some improvements under accelleration then of course weve worked a lot with bridgestone on both front and rear tyres weve definitely found some good things in this area as well helping our agility and stability in the corners and we are faster with these new tyres its been a good test and now we are looking forward to the final six battles
6136689 weve had a full couple of days testing and everyone has worked very hard with great results this is probably our last test of the season so its been very important for us to have this chance to check many small things especially tyres electronics and setting we have had a long week here in brno but both the race and the test have been very successful and now were looking forward to misano
6136690 these have been two positive days because weve improved our performance a lot in comparison to the race at the weekend however we can not forget that we are still far from where we want to be so we can not give up we have tried a lot of new things but mainly tyres with michelin and we have been able to find some tenths now we have to work with san marino in mind because we really need to change our situation there and have a good race finally
6136691 as planned yesterday we have concentrated on testing rear tyres today following our work on the front yesterday from all of the michelin material we tested today we have been able to find some improvements and now we hope that they can provide us with these tyres for misano we still have work to do but motivation in the team is still high for the final six races and everyone still has the same goal to finish with some good races we know that jorge and the team deserve much better results than we had here in brno so we hope that we can turn things around in misano
6136692 im really happy with how these two days have gone
6136693 today we started out well on the first run then we made a few changes that didnt really improve the setting that we had for the race so we decided to end the test early we did a good job yesterday and found the right path to follow which should allow us to use a softer tyre in future and seems to be more suited to my riding style i did well at misano last year and i cant wait to race there again
6136694 lo que es una violaci n de la constituci n
6136695 vamos a manifestar una serie de inconvenientes de los trabajadores del sector salud en cuanto a incumplimientos del ministerio de salud
6136696 deudas y rupturas de acuerdos con trabajadores de la salud en general
6136697 there arent enough police to make enforcement work in a significant proportion of the city
6136698 isnt the federal government talking about lowering speed limits to help fuel economy
6136699 why are there so few cars in this rendering they should have made it far harsher
6136700 i just went out and bought kelly and eriks book now all i need is a patch of earth to
6136701 the saddest part is i believe that the dr didnt doesnt and wont ever think he
6136702 una cosa es el alba y otra cosa es que haya en nuestro pa s la presencia de un agresor que est demandado ante la corte interamericana de los derechos humanos
6136703 porque como le digo el problema de la violencia para nosotros es una cuesti n de principios y aceptar eso ser a fortalecer la violencia contra la mujer que se vive en nuestro pa s
6136704 para nosotras el acto en s abuso contra zoilam rica narv ez es condenable nosotras hemos estudiado el caso lo conocemos lo que zoilam rica vivi en sus a os de infancia y es realmente condenable bajo ning n concepto nosotras aceptamos una agresi n en contra de una mujer
6136705 mire haberse cobijado con la inmunidad y haber argumentado que este caso ya prescribi me parece que no es una posici n realmente honesta justa lo que nosotros pedimos es justicia para zoilam rica a nivel internacional
6136706 its the other 98 that ruin it for the 2 of honest lawyers magistrates and judges in colorado and across the country
6136707 obviously this medical debt can push people over the edge who are already close to the edge
6136708 it is being taken seriously by tea drinkers all over the world
6136709 we took it on more as a 700 year project hopefully well still be drinking tea in 700 years
6136710 this is a terrific opportunity for us to enter colorado with a very well managed bank in a great market area
6136711 bank of the san juans is a highly regarded bank that continues to post outstanding asset quality strong operating results and solid growth even in todays challenging banking environment we are very excited about adding a talented banking team and an excellent market to the glacier family of banks while strategically expanding our footprint in the west furthermore we are pleased to extend value to their shareholders through the fixed shares structure and the recent strength in our stock price
6136712 we couldnt have chosen a better partner than glacier we maintain our position as a durango based bank with local decisionmaking and a genuine commitment to personalized community banking at the same time we benefit from access to glaciers products services and substantial capital resources to fund future growth in our region the combination is clearly a win win for our shareholders our employees and most importantly our customers
6136713 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
6136714 from the ratings week ending aug 17 abc cbs and fox each had their lowest rated and least watched week in recorded people meter history
6136715 it comes and goes my memory the flashbacks waking up on the side of the road the blood the pain how did i get here the surgery the anger the only thing that is clear the only thing that makes sense is to get revenge try to remember find them make them pay my time will come tna will soon know me but i must remember to be patient im not ready to unleash him yet im not strong enough yet but i will be soon patience then payback
6136716 espn is interested in acquiring the television rights to the 2014 and 2016 olympics and would carry more of them live regardless of the time zone than nbc traditionally has done
6136717 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
6136718 from the ratings week ending aug 17 abc cbs and fox each had their lowest rated and least watched week in recorded people meter history
6136719 but im not that way and neither are my colleagues
6136720 were able to take the high road even when we talk about controversial subjects
6136721 i have a right to talk about politics if i want to
6136722 were achieving great performance with strong prospects in all of northcotts business lines
6136723 weve been doing very well in recent years and are doing relatively well in 2008 even in the midst of a soft economy we believe that northcott hospitality is well positioned for current conditions and beyond
6136724 im in a place i could only dream of an 818 valley girl now going to vip parties and big red carpet events on the other side of the hill but theres a lot to balance and figure out
6136725 but so far we havent seen anything except for promises
6136726 we dont know how to live on and nobody talks about it
6136727 mccain maintains his lead in arizona mainly because evangelicals and conservative democrats are disproportionately supporting him the mccain campaign also appears to have successfully created a fairly strong anti obama sentiment in the state
6136728 polls are not very good at determining who will and will not vote
6136729 a higher turnout will probably help obama more than mccain another factor will be whether the latino vote turns out in significant numbers
6136730 hes been running for president for so long that 60 percent of arizonans arent voting for him
6136731 the campaign has paid the expenses based on longstanding regulations

6136767 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6136768 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6136769 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6136770 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6136771 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6136772 as far as practice today i thought the quarterback was very good from the beginning of practice through the end he was really throwing the ball extremely well he was throwing against the wind most of the day too so we feel real good about where he is
6136773 i think its an example of two guys who havent missed one offseason workout theyve been out here on their own throwing thousands of passes to each other and it shows
6136774 ive never seen a quarterback like him with his kind of arm
6136775 hes calm cool and doesnt get flustered hes always on to the next play
6136776 you have to know the ball is going to get on you quick
6136777 at first i thought the ball rose it came so hard but its so much easier to catch now i dont know if hes changed anything or im used to the speed of the ball but all you need to do is make sure you get your eyes around and have fresh gloves
6136778 there was one play in offseason workouts where he stepped up saw something he liked and threw a 30 yard strike on an all go
6136779 i remember looking back and as soon as i got my hands up it was into my chest i caught it but it was on me so quick i couldnt believe it you try to catch with your hands but it still gets right through them to your pads
6136780 he took me under his wing when i was staying at the hotel during offseason training in may where i was sitting there looking at all four walls wed just hang out and chill
6136781 its just like any other teammate when you come in young you need people to be around to feel comfortable outside of football
6136782 he didnt have to be in the hotel for so long i brought him up there to let him know he was family we didnt really talk about football i just took him up there to let him be himself and chill out
6136783 the 170 new jobs millennium plans to add in the coming years is great news but its the technology these new associates will manufacture that has the most far reaching impact

6136814 with or without rommel were gonna teach em that you dont mess around with hitlers youth
6136815 our team is ready for war weve recently added a lot of depth to our roster with some players from different local little league teams such as the yankees the union jacks and stalins red army deathsquad so were in a good position to win no matter what hitler brings to the table

6136819 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6136820 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6136821 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such
6136822 ive been there not to dictate or guide im there to listen to what he wants to do and try to help him solve problems and make a wise decision

6136825 my group has been investigating what we believe is another taste quality calcium
6136826 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6136827 but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6136828 many animals have a specific calcium appetite which implies they can detect the mineral and consume sufficient quantities of it to meet their needs
6136829 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6136830 the pwk strain drank about four times more calcium than water
6136831 we can now say with some certainty that calcium is tasted
6136832 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6136833 hopefully we wont have to be sitting by as somebody dies to wait to chop their tongues off were not ambulance chasers there are cases where people have cancer of the tongue and have to get them removed
6136834 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
6136835 tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6136836 only you can make the tears dry up with your little cowbell rays of sunshine

6136843 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
6136844 is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
6136845 it is important to withdraw this monetary policy stimulus in a timely way
6136846 that may require us to withdraw before we are certain all of the weakness is behind us and before we are completely certain that financial markets are as tranquil as we would like to see
6136847 i certainly dont think the federal funds rate should be any lower given where we are now
6136848 it is clear to the board of trustees and to me that loyolas current designation does not accurately describe the depth breadth and excellence of its programs and that this change will be an invaluable part of our ongoing efforts to enable prospective students and other key audiences to understand fully the institution we have become
6136849 the concept of a university is reflective of large and impersonal business that does not embody what we as alumni and students know the college actually is
6136850 well continue to review all of our operations in the months ahead as we move forward
6136851 its part of the ongoing evaluation of our business any decisions regarding employment and operations will continue to be made on the basis of our busi ness levels

6136874 its a terrible example to set for a young child promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive
6136875 there is nothing feminine about inserting an electrode into the anus of a terrified and struggling fox and then electrocuting it ms paltrow is an actress and seemingly a particularly stupid one at that
6136876 a woman outside started shouting to lily and she just lashed out at her though she missed with her punch
6136877 not surprisingly the woman didnt seem that scared by lily in fact she seemed more bemused by it all
6136878 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6136879 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your heads to be professional
6136880 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6136881 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6136882 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6136883 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia
6136884 leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6136885 we see telescope as a real facilitator for us helping us share resources collaborate and move projects through the make process
6136886 with telescope managing our digital content our team can spend less time chasing assets and do an even better job of meeting deadlines and delivering high quality publications
6136887 we continue to witness the global trend of publishers transitioning from print publishing to digital publishing
6136888 the decision by chronicle books to choose the telescope digital asset management solution will drive real process improvements and savings in their organization north plains is known as the dam provider of choice in the publishing industry because we understand that our customers need tools to help them increase productivity cut production time shave costs and generate new revenue streams

6136891 it seems to me that dancap seeks to obtain the rights to control the sale of the theatres through this motion
6136892 it did not negotiate for this right in the term sheet
6136893 our position was validated by the judge and he seems to have accepted all of our arguments

6136903 a blueprint and timeline for transformational change in canadian health care to bring about patient focused care
6136904 the vast majority of doctors across canada dont own a chain of private clinics
6136905 we work in the public system we work with patients some of whom can and most of whom cant afford to pay for their own health care
6136906 the private public rhetoric is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda
6136907 those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
6136908 as well the proportion who reported becoming sexually active at a very early age decreased
6136909 however among those who were sexually active there was no significant change in the likelihood of having multiple partners or for males using condoms so while some adolescents have adopted measures to reduce their risks of sexually transmitted infection and unwanted pregnancy others report high risk behaviour
6136910 it has been a long and difficult journey with a lot of pressure but it ended beautifully now i can just be happy

6136931 we are absolutely elated to be listed on inc magazines list of fastest growing companies for a third straight year our ranking is a testament to the dedication of our staff our excellent service and technology offering and our continued innovation
6136932 when kris and i hired our first employee nearly five years ago i knew that we embarked on something big very big i just didnt know how big the irony of pepperjams success is that from those first days to the present day our team comes into the office everyday with the attitude that weve only just gotten started
6136933 we still dont know if this guy obama is a u s citizen or not he will not produce his birth certificate
6136934 says he was born in hawaii he refuses to prove it to the american people
6136935 i cant fathom this how he hasnt had to produce a birth certificate
6136936 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
6136937 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
6136938 and whether it shows through depends on how much force was put into it
6136939 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
6136940 to see if they could try and resolve the issue with the people who were asking questions
6136941 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
6136942 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
6136943 just go out there and pick each other up believe in each other and believe that we can get back to the postseason
6136944 we play most of those teams we need to catch so its up to us we need to leave it all out there this is a playoff atmosphere now where we have to win games

6136953 volkswagen has prided itself for a long time for making cars that are almost really good
6136954 unfortunately thats not going to be good enough any longer
6136955 in the days following the announcement of the tennessee plant we took a poll of american volkswagen owners
6136956 while many reported liking the fact that their cars look cool or cute it seems that most are unhappy with the way their vehicles perform
6136957 one respondent said it was like everything just kept breaking on his car

6137058 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
6137059 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same

6137129 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6137130 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6137131 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6137132 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6137133 we had come to the conclusion that we would add to any nascar imposed penalties with the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs
6137134 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident

6137145 im sorry i piddled on the meter it was unintentional i was out with friends looking for a good time and i was busting
6137146 i couldnt stand properly i wasnt pissed off with the parking meter i was not aware of what i was doing
6137147 it is distasteful and tacky and i will certainly not be going to stand in the street but it is clear that some people regard it as an intriguing and voyeuristic opportunity
6137148 i would much rather we did not have it in our city but what is clear is there is precious little local government can do to stop it it would be nice if nobody turned out to watch it and they just went away

6137152 the first person i spoke to positively identified kerry they described what she was wearing and said she was carrying a cat carry cage
6137153 then it was just a matter of getting police there
6137154 i dont think im brave i was just convinced that what had happened wasnt right
6137155 you couldnt meet a more kind and compassionate person than kerry
6137156 he is not sorry in the slightest he is sorry he got caught

6137158 we are not through all of this by any stretch of the imagination
6137159 this was the first time ive seen him since he left the office he has never made contact with us nor has there been any attempt to do so
6137160 he was in the public gallery and he didnt look at us not a gesture not anything
6137161 i am satisfied he was finally in front of a judge and that he has pleaded guilty

6137170 he was bold and prudent and the risks he took were calculated he inspired us to take journeys we never thought possible
6137171 the only consolation to the sudden and tragic death was it happened in the alpine environment and he was surrounded by people who cared desperately for him

6137175 it is only a matter of time before the growing army of unemployed and under employed turns from restless to violent
6137176 these are all long standing concerns poor health low education high unemployment there are no easy answers for any of them
6137177 we are continuing to assess the effectiveness of our schemes in those areas and to look at ways to make them more effective it is a very difficult and complex set of social problems
6137178 the problem for new zealand is that the second group of countries includes the largest most populous islands

6137198 falling though the gaps is a phrase that could have been coined to describe the experience of asylum seeking children in the uk it is therefore imperative that policies aimed at vulnerable children do not simply repeat previous mistakes as a society we must rise to the challenge of protecting those hardest to protect

6137229 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements as well as give our partners greater breadth in their solution offerings
6137230 customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments our increased investment in the relationship with novell is intended to give our customers and partners the best possible windows linux interoperability solution while also extending their existing windows server investments and helping to give them ip peace of mind
6137231 cross platform interoperability is something that we all want and need to achieve but its difficult to accomplish this

6137237 im getting tired of people saying that sure there are hard times but you just have to make it work with some personal budgeting
6137238 employers lose staff because they staff come with unrealistic expectations you have to do your maths whats coming in and whats going out
6137239 they like the lifestyle but they want the income of a high paced city life theyre still going out most nights for dinner and drinks and they havent adjusted their expenses to their new income
6137240 youve got to budget for things like that or you mount up debt work out first if you can sustain it with your income
6137241 you dont come to queenstown to party holiday and make money all at the same time
6137242 you can make it work wherever you live a place with high income and low expense just doesnt exist
6137243 we just got stuck on the side of the road
6137244 it wasnt really that long but it felt like it

6137313 like kenny i want to fight the best in my division and right now he might be the no 1 contender so fighting him is kind of a no brainer i want to get one fight in before the year is out i would prefer november but i would wait around to fight kenny in december
6137314 for a guy like kenny to consider me as a formidable opponent hes fought for the title and hes on a lot of peoples list for a possible future title shot so its good for me
6137315 i dont think kennys really calling me out hes just making a statement that he wants to fight tough opponents
6137316 as an athlete i have a lot of respect for frankie edgar for what hes accomplished
6137317 it was the same with roger huerta i had nothing against roger i liked roger but he was the best opponent available at the time its nothing personal
6137318 i want to fight frankie because hes a great fighter thats the most important thing its about respect and beating someone like frankie edgar will get me more respect

6137348 a few companies are going through it at the moment with franchise operation and i think its reflective of perhaps the tougher times out there
6137349 i suppose the company was obviously my vision my baby and something that i started so when it does get tough there can be instances where the franchisees dont love it enough or perhaps dont have the resources to weather it
6137350 ive always held the lions share never had more than 10 franchised
6137351 ive been a big advocate of controlling my own destiny and the way to do that is through your own retail environment because that is how you present to the world that is how you showcase your product
6137352 i think new plymouth is a very untapped market with the company store versus the franchise store the budgets are different so that store now is overloaded with stock whereas in the past it would be more reflective of where the franchise owners budget was

6137363 the aptly named racecourse was initially known as a horse racing venue and staged its first contest the town purse in 1807 at the time it offered a prize of 20 guineas worth about 3 600 today after about 50 years the races were stopped amid concerns that they encouraged crowd trouble including drunkenness in the 1860s the venue began to be used for autumn sports including donkey races and cycle races as well as horse racing the racecourse was also used by wrexham cricket club and it was the clubs members who formed wrexham football club in 1872 as a way of keeping active during the winter months research shows the football club was formed in the now famous turf hotel which stands just outside the ground and where historians say players used to change for matches the first international football match was held five years later in 1877 when wales lost 2 0 to scotland the following year however wrexham fc won the first ever welsh cup
6137364 this educational failure is the foundation of poverty in wales and relegates a significant proportion of the population to labour market failure and consequent patterns of low income unemployment and benefit dependency
6137365 swamping the system both at westminster and in the assembly
6137366 the assembly acquired its new legislative powers on the 25 may 2007
6137367 in paragraph 21 of its memorandum the committee refers to the fact that it had expected to have to deal with
6137368 the memorandum states that the committee has already reported on three of the four lcos referred to it and expects to report on the fourth soon
6137369 we have published timely reports on all sic of the proposed orders which have been referred to us so far
6137370 so the committees claims about its performance during the first year of the process obviously does not support any suggestion that the system is being
6137371 in fact the number of lcos which have been proposed in the last 12 months has reached 11 already

6137397 so how did a red faced plump mid canterbury girl become who i am now
6137398 i remember my first production jack the ripper where i murdered all my friends it was a seven year old splatter play
6137399 i discovered it was much more fun being someone else rather than myself
6137400 i am about as rural as a pair of silk underpants on a fencepost but coming back to the south island i feel like i have come home
6137401 when i tell people where i am from they think i am honest which is hilarious because i lie for a living
6137402 when i see a teenager i feel for them going to high school and i want to say go to sleep and wake up five years later
6137403 im taking it steady and leaving nothing to chance but im getting closer every day
6137404 when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia

6137406 the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken longer than i would have liked

6137408 the mothers obsession with wanting the daughter to be perfect
6137409 one 10 year old had thick hair coming down her leg and she had a bikini and leg wax because she couldnt go to camp like that without getting teased
6137410 look at those blackheads you need to have a facial
6137411 ahora hay que tratar de aprovechar la oportunidad la primera vez que jugu en primera hubo un poco de nerviosismo pero ahora tratar de cambiar eso
6137412 tell him hes fucking amazing and i want to meet him
6137413 es conocida mi posici n por el no hay formas de expresar nuestra posici n pero no puede ser a base de formas que atenten en contra de la ciudad contra su ornato
6137414 tenemos muchas formas de hacer publicidad poner un cartel claro que diga no en nuestras casas un esticker en nuestro auto en nuestra bicicleta pero no ensuciemos la ciudad no irrespetemos los monumentos
6137415 los se ores roche y la se ora julie wohl tienen una sola cosa que justificar ante la ciudadan a su presencia en la universidad el s bado de los incidentes y esa presencia se justifica porque son alumnos de la universidad matriculados en una maestr a donde acuden precisamente los s bados a recibir clases
6137416 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
6137417 to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
6137418 obama has frequently voted to finance the war but was one of 14 senate democrats to oppose a war funding bill last year after republicans removed troop withdrawal deadlines saying he did not want to be validating the same failed policy in iraq
6137419 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
6137420 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk
6137421 goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6137422 goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6137423 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6137424 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them
6137425 it is striking how unqualified sen barack obama is and and how this whole thing came about with within the democrat sic party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6137426 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them its the reverse of it theyve theyve ended up nominating and placing at the top of their ticket somebody whos not qualified who has not earned it
6137427 its perfect affirmative action and because of all this guilt and the historic nature of things nobody had the guts to say well wait a minute do we really want to do this
6137428 goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6137429 the sunday brought with it a severe frost not what the aucklanders are used to but a beautiful day followed
6137430 it is estimated that 1600 people came through on the sunday
6137431 we had trade sellers from as far away as auckland and private sellers from as far as rotorua
6137432 we think that overall it was a great success and an event that can only grow through more hard work and continued support of a lot of people
6137433 ich komme nicht mehr aus dem bett f hle mich kraftlos und leer wenn ich jetzt nicht aufh re dann gehe ich zugrunde ich bin k rperlich und psychisch am ende seit monaten empfinde ich keine freude mehr
6137434 had the option to buy a business or a plot in prime towns like kitale or eldoret not far from home and she had the option to be the proud owner of more than 500 head of cattle
6137435 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
6137436 anybody who thinks lobbyists arent paying for things they are
6137437 i think lobbyists are still needed they are needed out there but the question is would a member do something for money i think that the lobby will will probably help somewhat but it was most likely a cosmetic situation too because lobbyists are still allowed to host things at conventions and lobbyists are still out there
6137438 its about not abusing the situation which is what i did and what my staff did so its about not doing that
6137439 in my case the ethics committee evaporated and you ended up with a direct head on confrontation with the justice department and im not sure in all cases that is the best way internal enforcement by the house and the senate is also good and then it can be referred to justice a two pronged approach but the ethics committee evaporated at that point in time when i was there
6137440 yeah i believe i did some things that frankly with the alcohol can diminish your judgment and in some cases i didnt care i thought so what everybody goes out and eats dinner no one keeps track of it the blas things you get into you let your guard down thats what i did and i paid a price for it
6137441 ive been picking up the pieces and thanks to ellen ratner i have got a job well im pretty fortunate
6137442 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6137443 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6137444 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6137445 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6137446 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6137447 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6137448 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6137449 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6137450 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6137451 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6137452 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6137453 to finish off this whole olympics by finally getting the gold medal its the best feeling in the world
6137454 you have to get over all 10 and if you cant youre not meant to be the champion today i was not meant to be the champion
6137455 this is a very conservative sport their excuse that is you cannot have accessories on your swimsuit but they are sewn in if you use those standards sequins are a type of accessory
6137456 that was exactly what i wanted from the first round
6137457 i felt real good instead of sitting back i allowed myself to get in the hunt when i got in the lead i wanted to shut it off but i had to re accelerate im glad i had to do it because it shows i had that kick
6137458 following a rigorous review of operating performance and local market dynamics these company owned outlets are not producing acceptable returns
6137459 the high degree of technical complexity associated with recovering heavy oil in a harsh marine environment
6137460 the new management team joined the company at the end of this reporting period on june 23 2008
6137461 one of our main objectives is to strengthen our financial and operating performance going forward as our management styles and industry experiences become imbued at south texas
6137462 women have strengths that amaze they carry children they carry hardships they carry burdens yet they hold faith happiness love and joy

6137466 its the 100th day after his death today and the whole family is still overwhelmed
6137467 to us nothing is interesting and nothing will ever be fun again
6137468 of course im watching its chinas games why shouldnt we watch
6137469 people have to make a living we cant just sit around all day
6137470 ive got a factory job during the day and a peach orchard to tend every evening
6137471 its peach picking season right now so there are so many things to do sure i watched the gold medals china wins but frankly i have no energy for the games
6137472 we sell this to the candy makers and get a good price for this
6137473 it is only a matter of time before the growing army of unemployed and underemployed turns from restless to violent
6137474 about 80 per cent of the pacifics population growth is found in the low growth group of islands where employment is rare and living standards are not rising
6137475 laura marling mean excitement and joy for one and all
6137476 we decided at 84 there isnt much time to play with
6137477 after 64 years of marriage its time to do something different
6137478 you just go up and drift on the air currents
6137479 the greater transmission capacity provided by the new fibre cable will support high speed data services such as adsl2 broadband connectivity internet speeds of up to 24 megabytes per second for te anau
6137480 it just went from under us i got over to john and the children there was quite a rip running so it was difficult to stay in touch
6137481 i did hear a plane go over and i remember swearing at it badly for not seeing us
6137482 it took john a long time to get over it and the childrens mother it took her some time
6137483 i was in the air force in the second world war and our plane was shot down over france in 1944
6137484 i was a prisoner of war for 15 months so i might have been a bit more used to such things
6137485 we just got stuck on the side of the road
6137486 it wasnt really that long but it felt like it
6137487 its easy to take shots at parking wardens because its not a popular job
6137488 its not a case of saying someone got a ticket because they did something wrong so end of story
6137489 now im like a size 14 16 sometimes 18 i have three tracksuits that love me and i love them back
6137490 you can just look at people and say my gosh she really gained over the summer and a lot of the moms get smaller and smaller and im just getting bigger and bigger
6137491 just put that out of your mind because were never going to be perfect
6137492 someones always going to be younger and skinnier and cuter but no ones going to be you no one has you your experiences your husband your family youve got something nobody else has and you should be proud of that youve got all the ingredients youve just got to believe in yourself a little more
6137493 im just sick of being so emotional all the time and feeling so whiny and thats so not like me
6137494 i want to get back into living and start being the social butterfly that i once was
6137495 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6137496 um im not big on the north dakota version of mexican food
6137497 unless of course he isnt wearing a belt does this man wear a belt
6137498 this is my first job i have been here almost four years i was all right at school i wasnt good and i wasnt bad
6137499 if you wish to travel you must be qualified otherwise you wont get work
6137500 we always hoped the training we delivered in our workplace would ultimately lead to a nationally recognised qualification for our people and today we celebrate this milestone
6137501 this allows progressive learning and gives formal recognition for knowledge and skills learned on the job
6137502 la visite tr s m diatis e du pr sident de la r publique en afghanistan ne risque t elle pas d tre contre productive au regard de la capacit de r silience de notre pays cest dire de sa capacit encaisser des coups
6137503 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6137504 from what i have been able to see and without disrespecting my former team mates i have noticed that today sevilla have improved massively
6137505 im part of an impressive squad and i think its the best team we have had in four years
6137506 the year we started the business reliable racing supply i had gone to norway to follow up on an idea that they were making plastic slalom poles i contacted them and they sent us a bunch some people said i was just trying to make money thats not true
6137507 i can remember walking around the sidewalks with skis on
6137508 it was the great depression it got so bad especially in canada they really got hit hard so the family picked up and moved back to the states
6137509 soon after my father got a job with brown company the largest pulp and paper mill in the country in my mothers hometown berlin n h there were a lot of norwegians who immigrated to berlin to work in the mill they taught us all how to ski
6137510 every sunday morning we all gathered to jump and have meets
6137511 they had cross country races i learned the whole sport and it was great with downhill there were no lifts you walked up
6137512 for bindings you wrapped an inner tube around your ankle
6137513 one of the best things that keeps you going in skiing is running slalom gates
6137514 its not like around here where ski centers are close together out west theyre all spread out you had to go 1 000 miles to get to reno the money wasnt great but that didnt matter because i was doing something i loved
6137515 i probably wouldnt have gotten back into it without that
6137516 on sundays kids that could go the fastest we threw them in the car and took them to a different place each week
6137517 we started right here in the basement of our house marilyn and i
6137518 my first order was for bibs they needed them immediately so we worked all night to get it done when we delivered the order the guy said you guys are quite reliable who do i make the check out to
6137519 we didnt even have a company name yet so i said make it out to reliable racing thats how it started nobody had put together a company that supplied ski areas especially racing
6137520 we sold tons of stuff every year we went to europe for trade shows and brought back stuff nobody had ever heard of at one time or another with one product or another we have sold to almost every ski area in north and south america
6137521 hed never heard of them and didnt know how to use them
6137522 all the way back to glens falls i sold every single one of them
6137523 i used roller skis to show people how to use them in winter i put on clinics i remember later i went back to this one store representatives from k2 and rossignol were there waiting as soon as the owner saw me he took me first thats the way it was
6137524 belongs to the fourth fleet the doctors nurses paramedics and specialists who have come in that ship have not come with the intention of carrying out intelligence work
6137525 they have come with the intention of providing humanitarian services but for that there is a division of labour and a ship like that is in a position to bring specialists who are engaged in intelligence work while the others do their humanitarian work
6137526 we welcome the humanitarian work but of course we cannot welcome the intelligence work
6137527 im talking about medical and dental care infrastructure schools and buildings that will be rebuilt and restored thats what im talking about
6137528 how do you tread the fine line between military and humanitarian missions how can you think about coming to nicaragua in that big boxy grey ship without scaring people
6137529 what they cared about was that we were bringing humanitarian aid to a disaster area
6137530 what i see is a big humanitarian mission i dont see anyone sticking their noses in anything only people helping the needy
6137531 through our efforts today we are enjoying the presence of this humanitarian aid team and we hope they will keep coming and that more will come
6137532 there is a warship in bilwi but with medical aid the ships from the u s are coming to help the people and we have to sincerely express our gratitude
6137533 we have invited him to similar events and he has not come although he has sent members of his government
6137534 ortega has not been taught what to do when the enemy holds out his hand
6137535 he has many bad things to say about the united states and continuously criticises it but this time he didnt know what to do when his enemy extended its hand and now a grateful ortega suddenly shows up expressing a welcome message
6137536 the women who migrate illegally need to accept that they will be raped not once but many times
6137537 it will be a place for these women to reflect that is absolutely safe
6137538 this way theyll be able to take more time making a decision on their future
6137539 they want to at least earn as much as they borrowed to get over the border
6137540 they struggle with depression they lose everything even the desire to cross
6137541 a woman in mexico especially an indigenous woman is very marginalized
6137542 the woman who crosses the desert with children will usually be the one to carry the children
6137543 when she is deported after being exploited on the journey she is wrought with fear
6137544 the closer you get to the border the less people are willing to talk about this complicated issue
6137545 we want to create a common space where we can discourse
6137546 parish based and reflect on the challenges the border presents in the light of the gospel narrative and catholic social teaching
6137547 the mexican jesuits have a long history of doing this kind of education and formation in southern mexico
6137548 you try crossing here and youll find border patrol agents all over
6137549 you cross at night and youll run into a gang member wholl take everything you have
6137550 some just duck in there and try to cross again
6137551 we want to make the best use of our resources
6137552 were going through more water than we ever have before
6137553 as expected patients in the taxane group experienced significantly higher rates of selected toxicities
6137554 patients in the taxane group also had significantly worse emotional distress and mental quality of life throughout treatment rates of probable clinical depression also were high
6137555 emotional recovery for patients in the taxane group required 2 years on average versus 6 to 12 months for patients in the no taxane group
6137556 these data suggested that taxane based chemotherapies confer risk for significant psychological symptoms depression in particular should be monitored
6137557 psychological interventions tailored to the context of the cancer may be efficacious
6137558 im taking it steady and leaving nothing to chance but im getting closer every day
6137559 when i get the go ahead i guarantee ill be in great shape and hopefully in a position to make an immediate impact for both everton and australia
6137560 the longer you are out the more you appreciate what it means to play at the top level and theres no doubt in my mind ill be back bigger and better than ever
6137561 the operation went well but the rehabilitation has taken longer than i would have liked

6137589 dad looked at life as a cup full to over brimming
6137590 he never looked at it as empty or half empty that would never occur to him he was forward looking and forward thinking and always thinking
6137591 weve lost our forestry god father our forestry guru who set a great example
6137592 he implemented programs and set up things here that were way ahead of their time many of them are still in place
6137593 it always amazed me his continuing interest and passion for forestry
6137594 you can imagine during that time the politics were very strong
6137595 usually when a government changed hands at least half of the people within a department were fired he survived that because he was so valuable he didnt pull any punches he was not afraid to speak his mind and people valued that they realized his objectives were pure
6137596 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6137597 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
6137598 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6137599 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
6137600 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
6137601 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
6137602 there was clearly a problem the plane fell to the ground and clearly there are many many injured there is an emergency plan for many injured and we have organised a special area for ambulances
6137603 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6137604 this is the closest thing to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling we burnt ourselves collecting them

6137620 i would advise that you contact your isp internet service provider about this matter please also note though that accessing the us itunes store outside of the geographic region of the united states is not supported and that attempting to access it while in china is at your own risk
6137621 this is the first of many stores we will open in china

6138107 conventional wisdom dictates that full range sonics are not possible from a console the size of a candy bar but dr guenther believes that deviation from the norm is essential to creative and successful product development

6138112 the power that is distributed through the system doesnt equate to the revenues that gpa is supposed to be taking in
6138113 revenue loss drives up rates for all paying customers and theres also a loss of revenue that cannot be reinvested back into our power system
6138114 if a meter is tampered with you run the risk of an electrical fire in your home or even shock

6138144 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6138145 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6138146 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6138147 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity

6138152 what the donations clearly do buy is access to lawmakers and opportunities to influence them

6138187 it has such an eventful active landscape and it feels like youre a million miles from the city
6138188 the people there have managed to preserve what feels like a village
6138189 weve been there many times to write music because its a really good place to go and clear your head
6138190 somehow the things you think of out there seem a bit more trustworthy and reliable
6138191 hes getting a name for himself and hes made a great album

6138199 the only way to resolve this is by negotiation and once again i would urge the unions to meet us and to jointly reach a solution to the difficult situation that we all find ourselves in
6138200 but they need to come back to the unions with clear proposals to address the impact of rising prices on our members
6138201 if there is no movement then we will have to look to further action in the future
6138202 there is a sense of pride that comes from beating the champs
6138203 we know we were a different team four years ago and they were a different team
6138204 of course but effort is not going to be enough

6138208 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6138209 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6138210 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6138211 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6138212 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6138213 its up to the chinese authorities to decide whether they allow him to enter their territory
6138214 the bullying and adversity made him be stronger and work harder

6138216 michael may not have been able to focus in school but i saw a passion for swimming at such a young age

6138232 i wouldve expected some urgency actually it was quite a shock for us that the water was up already to just under a metre
6138233 its risen since the last time we dug a grave down there
6138234 weve put up with a lot of development out our way but this is the last straw
6138235 they had a tangi on and i was actually really concerned about the grave site filling up with water
6138236 there wouldve been quite a bit of water in there within an hour and it wouldnt have been a good look
6138237 i dont know whos going to pay for it but i would like to see a beautiful stone wall constructed around the edge of the urupa and i would like it filled up with topsoil so that the graves have a certain amount of soil over them because it has certainly washed away it has reduced considerably
6138238 everybodys saying its not their problem and you have to contact such and such and when weve contacted them basically nobody wants to know you thats the part that really revs you up
6138239 what concerns me is theyve had qualified consultants and engineers come right along that creek
6138240 their ability to stand and offload in the tackle was a constant threat for the saint kentigern defence
6138241 they beat mt albert something we couldnt do this season

6138248 the committee notes with concern that the offence of encouragement of terrorism has been defined in section 1 of the terrorism act 2006 in broad and vague terms
6138249 in particular a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts
6138250 investigate allegations related to transit through its territory of rendition flights and establish an inspection system to ensure that its airports are not used for such purposes
6138251 there is still a lot of work to do before this city is fully recovered

6138253 any directory whose primary goal is to help you boost your search engine rankings should be looked at with suspicion if the list is intended to serve human visitors theres a far better chance that search engines would want the links to count otherwise it would be very tough to argue that the site isnt manipulative by nature heres a good general rule of thumb if the directory owner is active on seo forums blogs amp communities attempting to market to the seo audience be wary not all of these links will be of low quality but it should certainly raise a red flag
6138254 who knows one of these kids may save a life someday

6138257 the statistics for drowning in new zealand are unacceptable and the manukau community is way too represented
6138258 we have to make sure we can transition from attack to defence better
6138259 if we cough the ball up or turn the ball over we need to get into a defence pattern so quick so they dont score on us
6138260 we also need to capitalise on opportunities fully and convert them into points
6138261 jamie controls our number 2 in the lineout and is doing it very well
6138262 from his point of view he has just been waiting for the opportunity he did well against wellington
6138263 he has a huge work rate huge tackle rate took most of his own ball so he is pretty much a success story from friday night
6138264 youve got to remember there are 14 guys who havent played at this level before
6138265 although we certainly havent been getting the results in the past two weeks that weve been looking for there have been some good signs about controlling possession and territory
6138266 i dont think were ever going to be able to put the suspicions to bed

6138289 i have faith that obama will keep his promises but we also need to be diligent in reminding him about them and continuing to push to get them made
6138290 theyll be looking at our infrastructure in general for fire safety as well as security and custody and control
6138291 we look for stocks that will double and hopefully go up even more

6138304 the u s was not involved in that raid it was an element of one of the iraqi special operations forces do we support it in principle absolutely not
6138305 it was what appears to be a rogue operation its definitely concerning that we have an element that would go do something like that
6138306 from a legal scholar and activist at the movements vital center here is the fullest account yet in fact and in law of an ongoing struggle by determined anglophone cameroonians for liberation from la r publique du cameroun anyangwe makes the arguments for redress and anticipates the course of correction th is is an essential text for a dramatic and continuing story
6138307 the authors profound knowledge of this history and his expertise in the fi eld of international law provide for some new insights in the annexation story
6138308 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true
6138309 if a medium black hole existed in a cluster it would either swallow little black holes or kick them out of the cluster
6138310 we knew from x ray data that this black hole was actively swallowing up or accreting material if an intermediate sized black hole were accreting this material it wouldnt be too big of a deal for it but if a small black hole were accreting this material it would be a lot for it to take and therefore some material would be ejected in the form of high winds thus the high winds were our smoking gun showing that this black hole is small
6138311 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6138312 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6138313 im going to cast my ballot for her and then the moment i cast my vote im going to continue to enthusiastically support sen obama its going to be a good release for all of us
6138314 they immediately encountered extreme fire and heat conditions and they turned back and launched an external attack
6138315 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
6138316 because theres no nutritional value when an animal eats a cigarette butt or several cigarette butts they feel full and can actually starve to death
6138317 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6138318 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
6138319 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6138320 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6138321 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6138322 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6138323 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6138324 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6138325 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6138326 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6138327 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6138328 the liberal dark decade is over the conservative government is getting tough on drug crime so that hard working canadians and their families dont have to pay the price for this despicable trade

6138333 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
6138334 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
6138335 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
6138336 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
6138337 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
6138338 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
6138339 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
6138340 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
6138341 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing
6138342 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
6138343 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
6138344 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be

6138359 i have no name in this satirical comment because it could be misinterpreted in a future campaign
6138360 one important factor in my decision will be what the expectations of canadians are when they expect an election should be held
6138361 im listening to canadians and many canadians are telling me now more than before we are ready for an election and i take that into account
6138362 or whether or not the government needs a new mandate
6138363 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc quebecois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately
6138364 dion has indicated that the government should be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he doesnt have good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
6138365 i think these are very strong signs that we are going in the fall
6138366 certainly stephane dion didnt step back and say lets think about this he stepped it up a bit
6138367 fixed election date idea more before he put it in
6138368 i want my programme so the rest of you should pay more taxes
6138369 an election in the fall might not be a bad thing it would be a great opportunity to rid the house of some of the hacks flaherty baird del mastro sp polievera sp van loen sp wow all these guys are from ontario
6138370 what has harper done they brought in tougher crime legislation they reduced income taxes they reduced the gst twice they increased defence spending and restored our dignity on the world stage there are lots of other things but at the very very least he has kept liberals out of power and out of our pockets
6138371 fixed election dates unless i want an election a different time
6138372 how on earth could we have been so stupid as to elect the conservatives again
6138373 neocon agenda what is a neocon lol oh yes thats an american term yet the liberals sure use it alot
6138374 the fixed election dates act establishes fixed election dates for canadian federal elections every four years except when a government loses a vote on a non confidence motion in which case an election would be held immediately

6138392 their intent as far as we know based on the type of damage to her body was to prevent her from being identified if found
6138393 her friends gabriel yates and anne were involved in the murder of a 17 year old prostitute named nikki whom yates had been pimping out on craigs list
6138394 we do believe there was a relationship between the three of them
6138395 yates was heard to say he worked in a slaughter house as a teenager skinning animals blood did not bother him and he knew how to get rid of a body
6138396 nikki began to cry told them she was leaving and was going to tell the police osburn and yates were pimping out an under age girl
6138397 yates made the statement that the police had the body and had the right man
6138398 anything he told her to do she would listen she was a good dog to him

6138413 i was peeping my way through the neighborhood looking for a potential mid day snack when i looked down through the craveners basement window and saw two of the skinniest children ive ever seen in my life
6138414 the children were clearly malnourished by the looks of them those kids didnt have more than 5 10 pounds of edible meat on their bodies id like to give those parents a piece of my mind im just in complete awe that i live in the same neighborhood as these scumbags it sickens and scares me to tell you the truth
6138415 its great to see someone like lester come forward and help get these children into safe hands weve endured a lot of heartbreak around these parts lately 4 different families have had their children kidnapped in the past month the cops found a couple of half eaten corpses in a dumpster but none of the children have been found alive and returned to their families im just happy to know that at least one crime has been taken care of thanks to mr binkley
6138416 i dont need any of that just take the spliff
6138417 this order marks a major milestone in internet policy for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6138418 the fccs action confirms that it is illegal for internet service providers to block or impede access to lawful online content this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to unfettered internet access
6138419 contrary to the claims made by comcast and others the fcc is well within its authority to protect the open internet either by adopting rules or acting on complaints it is the fccs responsibility to promote openness free speech and competition the bedrock goals of the communications act
6138420 standing on the solid legal foundation established today by the fcc internet users must remain vigilant in defending an open internet cable and phone companies would now be wise to obey the law they can trust that the fcc is ready to punish any violations

6138430 implement a broad program of action and cooperation in various sectors including tourism and economic relations and across a range of fields from investments oil trade and the development of the oil industry
6138431 so getting cheap oil or a subsidized oil will definitely help boosting the lebanese economy which is now picking up fairly after the doha agreement and also after the growing tourism during this summer here in lebanon and as far as trade there are so many commodities that lebanon especially in the food industry and some pharmaceutical products that lebanon can again penetrate and export to the iraqi market yet due to security and lack of any coordination it is not happening or taking place
6138432 we need to support barack obama and his quest for the oval office
6138433 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6138434 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6138435 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6138436 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6138437 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6138438 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6138439 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6138440 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6138441 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6138442 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6138443 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6138444 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6138445 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6138446 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6138447 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6138448 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6138449 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6138450 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6138451 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6138452 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6138453 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6138454 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6138455 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6138456 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6138457 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6138458 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6138459 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6138460 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6138461 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6138462 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6138463 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6138464 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend jeremiah wright reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda bernie mac he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6138465 having a young person like obama run for president has inspired many in the hip hop community
6138466 but hes running for president so hes not going to endorse any one genre of music or any one aspect of a cultural phenomenon like hip hop because hes going to be the president of all americans
6138467 it is not so much the natural bastards i worry about as the self made ones
6138468 i prefer those who would burn the flag and keep the constitution to those who would tear up the constitution and keep the flag
6138469 sergeant you must go over and reprimand both those men because under the amendments just passed by them it is now illegal for a prick to touch an asshole in this state

6138481 social media in the inc 500 the first longitudinal study
6138482 it departments play key role in the acquisition and deployment of web 2 0 technologies
6138483 social media is redefining how we relate to each other as humans and how we as humans relate to the organizations that serve us while it is commonly represented by blogs podcasts vlogs wikis user generated content and social networks it is not about those specific things as much as it is about what happens around and because of those things
6138484 social media are the means for any person to publish digital creative content provide and obtain real time feedback via on line discussions commentary and evaluations and incorporate changes or corrections to the original content
6138485 social media are those forms of publishing that are based on a dynamic interaction a conversation between the author and active readers in contrast with traditional broadcast media where the audience is a passive consumer of content

6138525 the media narrative thus becomes corsi refuted rather than obama embattled
6138526 obama nation is riddled with pretty much every unsubstantiated rumor you ever heard about obama
6138527 the mainstream press gave the charges carried in ads in books and articles and in major tv appearances a free ride for a spell then a respectful airing mixed with critique before in many cases finally attempting to shoot them down as overwhelmingly exaggerated or false
6138528 we are not judging the credibility of kerry or the swift boat veterans we just print the facts
6138529 self reporting by people who have used drugs as to when they stopped is inherently unreliable
6138530 corsi suggests without a shred of proof that obama may be using drugs today obama has acknowledged using marijuana and cocaine as a teenager but says he quit when he went to college and hasnt used drugs since
6138531 left a trail of wild theories vitriol and dogma that have called into question his credibility

6138555 i was peeping my way through the neighborhood looking for a potential mid day snack when i looked down through the craveners basement window and saw two of the skinniest children ive ever seen in my life
6138556 the children were clearly malnourished by the looks of them those kids didnt have more than 5 10 pounds of edible meat on their bodies id like to give those parents a piece of my mind im just in complete awe that i live in the same neighborhood as these scumbags it sickens and scares me to tell you the truth
6138557 its great to see someone like lester come forward and help get these children into safe hands weve endured a lot of heartbreak around these parts lately 4 different families have had their children kidnapped in the past month the cops found a couple of half eaten corpses in a dumpster but none of the children have been found alive and returned to their families im just happy to know that at least one crime has been taken care of thanks to mr binkley

6138572 it will be crucial to put maximum effort in building early bridges with the new us administration to take office next year and make sure that switzerland retains its long standing role as a privileged partner
6138573 looking ahead several crucial question marks threaten the positive development of the swiss american business relationship
6138574 the bilateral relationship between switzerland the usa the situation has not improved over the last two years
6138575 not done much to align the us swiss interest and to strengthen the swiss position as partner of choice
6138576 finally the current discussion on swiss banking secrecy rules and the troubles of a large swiss bank in the us do not help to improve the relationship
6138577 unlike other professions where you make machines work this profession allows one to deal with the most complex phenomena on earth ranging from most studious to most mischievous students the teachers need to maintain a balanced attitude and approach in transforming them to mature individuals
6138578 a word with so many connotations and denotations cannot be employed in precise discourse without definition
6138579 the declaration of belief in or acceptance of religion or a faith
6138580 a vocation requiring knowledge of some department of learning or science
6138581 inherent within this context is the elite and prestigious connotation many hold of the professions to this day
6138582 the original professionals addressed each other and members of the ruling elite who shared some of their knowledge and belief in its virtues they did not address the common people or the common specialized trades so it is our time
6138583 i believe i am a professional because i am a master at what i do i love what i do and i make a living at what i do i engage in this activity known as teaching so much that it is what i live for therefore i believe that i am a professional
6138584 teaching should not be considered as a profession because not enough training is given to those who go into it
6138585 being a professional conveys the connotation not only of a high level but of a consistent level of performance professional athletes or professional entertainers for instance can be counted on to perform in diverse and sometimes adverse circumstances they can and often do perform regardless of personal mood motivation or even injury neither the expectations nor the level of performance of a professional is demanded of an amateur
6138586 instead of looking at the real problem poor working conditions and low salaries the government is arguing that we need to become tougher on our teachers demand more in terms of work and do more testing to see if teachers are doing their jobs
6138587 bush has proved this by his approach to another similar problem low morale in the armed forces to cure that problem has he argued that we need to demand more of our soldiers no instead bush has decided that we need to increase the salaries of our armed forces
6138588 his business logic is self evident the only way to draw the best talent is to pay the best wages its not that the talent isnt there to staff our armed just chosen to go where the pay and appreciation matches the jobs demands
6138589 teaching is or ought to be a difficult and complex endeavor when one considers what is expected of a teacher in terms of end results the preservation and improvement of our culture and civilization teaching is perhaps the most important job in a democratic society
6138590 they genuinely like children and want to help them achieve success
6138591 in my opinion mastery of the subject matter and staying current having a teaching plan and being organized and developing ones communication skills are the responsibility of
6138592 implementation of the highly qualified teacher provisions of the no child left behind act
6138593 a highly qualified teacher as one who has 1 fulfilled the states certification and licensing requirements 2 obtained at least a bachelors degree and 3 demonstrated subject matter expertise
6138594 research shows that teacher subject matter knowledge is greatly associated with student learning
6138595 although teaching is hard the fact that teaching is a privilege and a blessing and that has not changed
6138596 that his job is very rewarding and it allows him to sleep well at night
6138597 a good teacher always brings a bit of him or herself into the classroom be creative they give to you what you give to them
6138598 i believe that if you put your heart into teaching you will receive great returns
6138599 90 of the children are good and are very interested in learning
6138600 a set of rigorous and validated assessments that provides accurate reliable information for use by state education agencies in making licensing decisions

6138602 i think this is the most sections weve had for pe schroeder said about the yoga classes with some 250 students

6138604 when we see land as a community to which we belong we may begin to use it with love and respect
6138605 a vocation or occupation requiring advanced education and training and involving intellectual skills as medicine law theology engineering teaching etc the body of persons in any such calling or occupation loosely any occupation
6138606 a vocation requiring extensive education in science or the liberal arts and often specialized training any vocation or business the body of persons engaged in an occupation the medical profession
6138607 an occupation that seeks to regulate itself by a developing a consensus concerning what its practitioners must know and be able to do and b developing an accreditation and licensing system to ensure the transmission of that knowledge and skill an occupation becomes a profession when organizations such as universities states and the public accept that system
6138608 i want to be a teacher when i grow up just like you
6138609 the real problem is not too few teachers entering the profession it is too many leaving
6138610 the kids were wonderful to be with but the stress of everything that went with it and the low pay did not make it hard to leave
6138611 its sad because you see a lot of the teachers that are young and gung ho are ready to leave
6138612 sabrina walasek loved teaching middle school science and math in daly city and felton near santa cruz but after six years the oakland resident found herself worn out from keeping kids in check the amount of energy spent on discipline and behavior management just got to me after a while
6138613 according to a national center for education statistics nces survey of 8 400 public and private school teachers the main reasons for high teacher turnover and attrition rates are inadequate administrative support 38 percent and workplace conditions 32 percent
6138614 the standardized tests dont affect the students grades but for administrators the results can destroy careers
6138615 according to the national commission on teaching and americas future 2 million teachers will leave their jobs within the next decade
6138616 no i gave the hug first and its up to me when the hug ends

6138623 im going to be so cranky and so demanding probably without the grace i would like to have
6138624 what other bad things will i be unleashed and not taking any prisoners
6138625 the thought of going to a library to look something up just stumps me ive never done that
6138626 its all in pictures in your head from when youve been actually dealing with these things
6138627 were so used to being in control of as much as we possibly can be
6138628 were used to having a choice and i think we will not be as meekly or helplessly set aside as we have perhaps imposed on our own elders
6138629 this is a marvellous opportunity for the children of mansfield to get involved in a christmas event
6138630 we want children to come up with a simple design including the colours and see their work in lights
6138631 their entry can be of anything to do with christmas from snowflakes to trees santa claus to bells anything they can think of
6138632 know it all with poor listening skills and a complete basketcase whos prone to flying off the handle at the drop of a hat

6138637 yearns to help children learn watch them grow and make a meaningful difference in the world
6138638 i love my subject but i know its not socially acceptable to say that in school i can be as enthusiastic as i want to be im able to convey that enthusiasm to the students to allow them to become confident and creative in their approach to the subject
6138639 relationships with students rewards instructional focus collegiality feeling needed and a desire to help others challenges and parents
6138640 life is learning and to be part of people developing and acquiring knowledge every person is unique and the challenge is to find fun ways to guide individuals to learn and understand what they are interested in learning
6138641 i love to see them growing personally socially and academically
6138642 they are rewarded more by witnessing their students succeed and follow their dreams than by any plaque
6138643 student achievement was another reward the teachers discussed as a reason for staying when their students were successful the teachers felt incredibly rewarded
6138644 they teach for the love of children and to contribute to the well being of all of us
6138645 teacher quality a report on the preparation and qualifications of public school teachers
6138646 do the ideal training teachers receive match with the reality they will face
6138647 there were issues for which no college or university could have prepared them
6138648 college did not prepare me for the student whose mother was murdered by a jealous boyfriend for the student who witnessed a drive by shooting for the student who was removed from her home because of an abusive father these realities do not exist in textbooks yet they are sadly all too often the realities that people with real lives and real problems bring into my classroom
6138649 between a quarter and a third of new teachers quit within their first three years on the job
6138650 purposeful in the treatment of each and so they are able to send the healthiest messages
6138651 our goal is not to try to make boys and girls the same we tried that several decades ago we might have more success if we teach boys and girls to respond to each other as people
6138652 the gap between those who benefit from digital technology and those who do not
6138653 access to digital technology greatly enhances the effectiveness and affordability of efforts to improve the water supply improve rural health and education generate jobs and address any of the other interrelated problems of poverty
6138654 to create a level playing field respecting the inherent right of all to self identify rather than be labeled
6138655 the future welfare and the national security of our country depends not only on how well we educate our children but also on how well we prepare teachers for working with racially and culturally diverse learners
6138656 my children are dealing with issues i never imagined when i was a 13 year old aids abuse neglect drugs and sex are buzz words i overhear in the hallways classrooms lunchroom and library

6138676 its two focal points were an insistence on scientific methods in thinking and on definition of knowledge and truth in terms of the cosequences of thinking experience or experimentation
6138677 the utopians believe that education is a conversation aimed at truth their object is to get everybody to take part in this conversation
6138678 if a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be
6138679 education for democracy must educate us not only for economic fitness or for the ability to make decisions in a voting booth but also for a shared social life and the pursuit of human possibility
6138680 the pupils interaction with his physical and social enviroment however significantly influences what he learns as an individual and how well he learns it
6138681 education without rigorous knowledge is no education at all but if organized knowledge is the only goal then education may become rigid and lifeless
6138682 do not then train youth to learn by force and harshness but direct them to it by what amuses their minds so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each
6138683 the only purpose of education is to teach a student how to live his life by developing his mind and equipping him to deal with reality

6138714 theres a lot more computing power thats not exposed apple s os 10 is a powerful mature operating system but theyve shut off a lot of features due to fears over how it runs on this mobile platform theyve got to expose more of that power a lot of the interest from legitimate device management security and business application firms will only help with the maturity of the operating system

6138718 i invite you to read my real life experience with starting an income online and the good and perhaps not so good experiences i faced until finally
6138719 were still being driven by the financials and the uncertainties surrounding fannie and freddie in particular
6138720 until that gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere

6138723 a growing body of new research suggests that something more collaborative is going on that we think not just with our brains but with our bodies a series of studies the latest published in november has shown that children can solve math problems better if they are told to use their hands while thinking another recent study suggested that stage actors remember their lines better when they are moving and in one study published last year subjects asked to move their eyes in a specific pattern while puzzling through a brainteaser were twice as likely to solve it the term most often used to describe this new model of mind is embodied cognition

6138733 philosophy has been taught in the theoretical realm rather than the practical sense
6138734 i s cooperative learning a true philosophy or is it something you do in the classroom because of your belief about the way children learn
6138735 hands on activity is the most effective way of learning and is considered true learning
6138736 emphasizes socially interactive and process oriented hands on learning in which students work collaboratively to expand and revise their knowledge base

6138740 the disputes have been dubbed the reading wars and the participants call them vicious
6138741 and if they tried to translate what they saw into sounds reading would be much too cumbersome
6138742 only when a question about phonics comes up in the course of reading
6138743 from 1971 to 1980 there was a steady improvement in the reading comprehension of nine year olds however during the 1980s the scores did not improve and rather declined
6138744 programs that combined systematic phonics instruction with meaning emphasis seemed to work best of all

6138777 in terms of preparing them for the world we need to redefine our attitudes towards traditional ideas of cheating
6138778 unless the students have a conceptual understanding of the topic or what they are working on they cant access bits and pieces of information to support them in a task effectively
6138779 in their working lives they will never need to carry enormous amounts of information around in their heads what they will need to do is access information from all their sources quickly and they will need to check the reliability of their information
6138780 i was a bit hesitant because i didnt know how it could help us
6138781 but i dont think it is cheating after having done it twice it just helps you find information to answer the question appropriately
6138782 it was good to have someone else to talk to and brainstorm some ideas with
6138783 i phoned my aunty who is pretty good at english i asked her about the olympic games and whether it was a waste of finances she gave me the idea that they use the money for infrastructure instead of for chinas people i expanded on that idea
6138784 they werent marked on their information about the olympic games but on whether they used persuasive language effectively to make their argument
6138785 what if we allowed the use of mobile phones and instant messaging to collect information during exams redefining such activity from cheating to using our tools and including the world in our knowledge base

6138800 many elderly people cannot financially recover once they have been defrauded
6138801 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
6138802 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates
6138803 the benefits of the number of people attending the games is expected to be largely offset by reduced business activity during the olympic period
6138804 it was more difficult to visit and come to the games because of visa issues
6138805 we were hoping to open before the olympics but its a pity that we didnt finish work in time
6138806 we are building a hotel chain each one of our investments has a goal we have a budget and a plan
6138807 rather than wait for health care reform as efforts lurch forward and back some consumers could benefit by taking a second look at individual policies
6138808 there is definitely more competition more players entering into the market and more products available than ever before
6138809 we are in a mature insurance market and some of the biggest potential is in the individual market
6138810 it may be better but its so bad that theyve got a long way to go before it gets to what we have in the small group market
6138811 weve never viewed these games simply as 16 days of spectacular olympic or paralympic sport
6138812 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6138813 we work very closely with the ioc on a daily and hourly basis they have set the agenda on sustainable venues with sport as a bridgehead into other things
6138814 we recognise that although instinctively i think wed have been drawn to it as well
6138815 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6138816 but we can be creative we know that more people will probably come to london for the games than to other cities
6138817 i think we can deliver a fantastic olympic and paralympic games but we can do great things in the city to drive other cultural values
6138818 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium for which weve been discussing a number of anchor tenancies as well as possibly an educational legacy or even an entertainment legacy
6138819 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with the new wembley stadium are over
6138820 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6138821 weve been looking at the legacy from the very moment our teams started looking at the master plans
6138822 but the strongest legacy were witnessing at the moment is the performance of team gb
6138823 ive always felt the primary purpose of a medal is that it signifies a big british moment and big british moments in sport have to have a conversion rate
6138824 for the chris hoys of this world and our rowers and swimmers the real challenge for our governing bodies and for sport more broadly is how many people can you get into the sport off the back of that great moment
6138825 im a football fan and we have to accept that its our national sport but i do think we can really elevate the status of some of our olympic sports
6138826 the bbc have had some of their highest viewing figures and a large chunk of the population are now very familiar with the faces of swimmers cyclists and rowers in a way they werent 10 years ago

6138830 thats a lot of money to a lot of people its a regular occurrence there is an unfairness about it
6138831 there is a growing gap between the upper level of the disputes tribunal jurisdiction and the point at which a claim becomes financially feasible to take it to the district court
6138832 in the meantime people are suffering by having to give away parts of their claim
6138833 if claimants want to make it fit they have to reduce their claim which to us does not seem to be natural justice

6138881 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6138882 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6138883 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6138884 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun

6138913 who is that long haired guy and what did he do to my library card
6138914 we knew the film had a marketable concept and a great title and we certainly felt it was well made
6138915 what we did not know and could not accurately predict is how playable it would be thats something you cant buy with marketing dollars genuine audience enthusiasm
6138916 it was definitely on our hit list and everybody elses hit list
6138917 what we saw with hamlet 2 was that there were risks mitigated by the fact that it is a very funny movie

6138919 couldnt generate major studio interest at sundance and now it will be released in house by the companys
6138920 the whole thing started out as a side plot for one of the characters in my novel
6138921 shortly after i finished writing my book i reconnected with an old dear friend i hadnt seen in close to five years i didnt think much about her request to meet in a non smoking environment until she arrived with a scarf on her head looking thin and tired
6138922 she was the first person i knew and cared about that had to fight cancer it broke my heart to see her feeling so sick but it also inspired me she was fighting and when she wasnt dealing with her own treatments she was mentoring troubled teens and helping her fellow patients she was doing good in a world that had essentially done her wrong i wanted to do something to help i just didnt know what
6138923 we were months away from releasing rorschachs ribs when i heard the sad news i had to go back and revise the whole swayze subplot
6138924 i was going to cut it from the book completely but then i got an idea rather than remove it i decided to make it an even bigger concept bigger than the book itself
6138925 point break and road house gave me a wealth of wisdom and sage like colloquies i was shocked at how much alike they were to the tao
6138926 i thought it would be a nice nod to the books original conception to use the characters of my novel as pen names
6138927 theres a special note at the end of the book that explains
6138928 ive wanted to do something to help for a long while this is a great chance to raise a lot of money for a cause im passionate about

6138932 ya know so im thinking about it because ya know i have players like nick young whos goofy so we can do paintball shooting and see who can get hurt on the grotto jumping into the pool

6138937 we believe she was not going to be truthful and we were not going to put on the witness stand someone we didnt believe was going to give truthful testimony
6138938 since this agreement was entered in june 2007 we all agreed on what she was going to testify to and shes never wavered from that
6138939 they wanted her to change her testimony and she wouldnt

6138946 they the advisory board may be a sounding board for review of the new master plan as well as the development guidelines or any future rewrites

6138984 this house believes that we can solve our energy problems with existing technologies today without the need for breakthrough innovations
6138985 didnt do this step or that step and still got a job
6138986 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6138987 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6138988 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6138989 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6138990 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6138991 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6138992 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6138993 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6138994 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6138995 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6138996 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6138997 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6138998 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6138999 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6139000 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6139001 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6139002 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6139003 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6139004 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6139005 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6139006 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6139007 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6139008 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6139009 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6139010 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6139011 this is really the biggest paradigm shift in innovation since the industrial revolution
6139012 for a couple hundred years or so manufacturers have been really imperfect at understanding peoples needs
6139013 it was 1932 when china first participated in the modern olympic games back then there was only one athlete liu chang chun who competed at the games
6139014 the leader of the team was my fathers uncle shen si liang when it came to the 1984 olympics my father was a journalist with the china daily and he reported on the games
6139015 the first dream is that china would compete in the olympics which he himself fulfilled in 1932 he also realised his second dream which was to lead a dozen athletes to compete at the 1936 games
6139016 the third dream was witnessed by my father who saw the chinese athletes win our first medal my granduncles last dream is that china could one day host the olympic games

6139028 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6139029 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6139030 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6139031 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6139032 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6139033 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6139034 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6139035 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6139036 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6139037 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6139038 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6139039 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6139040 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6139041 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6139042 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6139043 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6139044 who are open to doing something on the production side
6139045 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6139046 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6139047 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6139048 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6139054 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6139055 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6139056 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6139057 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6139058 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6139059 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6139060 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6139061 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6139062 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

6139064 whenever anyone asks why invest in china the answer is very simple thats where the money is and its where exponential future economic growth is also
6139065 the bank of china boc conducted a study of the effects of 12 olympiads on their host countries over the course of 60 years they found that nine of the twelve olympic host countries suffered a decline in gdp growth in the eight years after the games
6139066 the key to a post olympic slump is the size of the economy
6139067 china has made one of the largest investments ever in the olympic games with some estimates of spending topping 40 billion but we dont believe the capital city will go into a slump after the games
6139068 in fact beijing has been forced to defer other infrastructure projects during the run up to the games those and other pressing projects are expected to take up the economic slack in the city after the olympics
6139069 further thousands of factories have been shut down temporarily in the region surrounding beijing in an effort to reduce air pollution during the games also somey 50 of beijings automobiles are being taken off the roads and many heavy diesel trucks are being banned from the city
6139070 nationwide the effects of this economic event are likely to be absorbed by the immense momentum of chinas economy
6139071 among individual stocks china mobile has been in a holding pattern pending the beijing olympic games government regulators have ordered all telecom companies to refrain from signing up new subscribers until the games are over
6139072 its a highly unusual request but beijing says its a necessary move to prevent service disruptions due to increased loads on networks in chinas fast growing wireless communications sector
6139073 with more than 407 million subscribers china mobile retains an excellent reputation and has added as many as 6 million new subscribers every month thats an 87 share of the new subscriber market and a 69 share of the total market
6139074 china mobile appears set to gain exclusive access to the much coveted apple iphone in china in current negotiations
6139075 this top dog in chinas mobile phone scene has a pe multiple of 22 with a solid dividend yield of 2 29 considering its ongoing growth we see the company as attractively valued with a target sell price of 100

6139087 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6139088 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6139089 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6139090 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6139091 is going to consult with the chinese regarding efforts to secure a strong verification regime and additional progress in the six party talks
6139092 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

6139094 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6139095 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6139096 none of us would dream of flying in a plane driving a car or living in a house which we knew to be built to such shockingly poor standards of construction supervision and safety
6139097 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6139098 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6139099 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6139100 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6139101 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6139102 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6139103 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6139104 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6139105 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6139106 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6139107 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6139108 what do you think of the new 80 gb ps3 thats coming out soon
6139109 in the second lebanon war we had much greater means and capabilities which we avoided using since we fought against a terror organization and not a country
6139110 what do you think of the new 80 gb ps3 thats coming out soon
6139111 allison hinds had all the qualities we were looking for and a whole lot more to offer
6139112 according to the oklahoma domestic violence fatality review board our state is tenth in the nation for women murdered by men most of those women were in the process of trying to leave their abusers when they were killed and many had obtained orders of protection
6139113 too often that piece of paper does nothing to deter abusers from attacking again
6139114 we need to be able to create a zone of safety for these women with gps tracking we can do that
6139115 basically this helps create an electronic zone of safety and a way to prevent another attack should the abuser violate those boundaries
6139116 by using gps we are taking a proactive approach toward domestic abuse and hopefully well be able to save lives
6139117 he ran up by thirteen in the primary and anytime we see a candidate in a multi field with that kind of edge it almost always turns out that candidate wins a runoff loveless has a really huge mountain to climb to win
6139118 knocked a lot of doors and walked a lot of miles but he just hasnt seemed to generate much traction
6139119 presents a fresh face that a lot of people like
6139120 of course we still have almost a week to go so i guess anything can happen
6139121 russell is definitely favored how close it is depends on the turnout

6139123 i went to iraq for my country bob schaffer went to iraq for a big oil company
6139124 i tried to secure peace in iraq bob schaffer tried to secure an oil deal in iraq
6139125 our time in iraq left thousands with head trauma bob schaffers time in iraq helped land a contract for oil
6139126 too many vets cant get the care they need congressman schaffer voted against billions in funds for veterans
6139127 by going to invesco field at mile high we doubled the number of boxes and that has helped dramatically that and having the candidate have been a big difference
6139128 we will do what it takes we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives
6139129 fully half of those living in the parish say they are either dissatisfied 41 percent or angry 11 percent with the amount of progress that has been made

6139134 its defined him a great deal in the publics mind said thomas mann a senior fellow at the brookings institution a washington think tank
6139135 that along with the war in iraq are really the pivotal events in his political demise mann said
6139136 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower

6139141 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6139142 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6139143 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6139247 pero cuando lleg la cuarta noche ella dijo he llegado a saber oh rey afortunado que cuando el pescador dijo al efrit que no le creer a como no lo viese con sus propios ojos el efrit comenz a agitarse convirti ndose nuevamente en humareda que sub a hasta el firmamento despu s se condens y empez a entrar en el jarr n poco a poco hasta el fin entonces el pescador cogi r pidamente la tapadera de plomo con el sello de soleim n y obstruy la boca del jarr n despu s llamando al efrit le dijo elige y pesa la clase de muerte que m s te convenga si no te echar al mar y me har una casa junto a la orilla e impedir a todo el mundo que pesque diciendo all hay un efrit y si lo libran quiere matar a los que le libertan luego enumer todas las variedades de muertes para facilitar la elecci n al o rle el efrit intent salir pero no pudo y vio que estaba encarcelado y ten a encima el sello de soleim n convenci ndose entonces de que el pescador le hab a encerrado en un calabozo contra el cual no pueden prevalecer ni los m s d biles ni los m s fuertes de los efrits y comprendiendo que el pescador le llevar a hacia el mar suplic no me lleves no me lleves y el pescador dijo no hay remedio entonces dulcificando su lenguaje exclam el efrit ah pescador qu vas a hacer conmigo el otro dijo echarte al mar que si has estado en l mil ochocientos a os no saldr s esta vez hasta el d a del juicio no te rogu yo que me dejaras la vida para que alah la conservase a ti y no me mataras para que alah no te matase obrando infamemente rechazaste mi plegaria por eso alah te ha puesto en mis manos y no me remuerde el haberte enga ado entonces dijo el efrit breme el jarr n y te colmar de beneficios el pescador respondi mientes oh maldito entre t y yo pasa exactamente lo que ocurri entre el visir del rey yun n y el m dico ruy n y el efrit dijo qui nes eran el visir del rey yun n y el m dico ruy n qu historia es sa historia del visir del rey yun n y el m dico ruy n el pescador dijo sabr s oh efrit que en la antig edad del tiempo y en lo pasado de la edad hubo en la ciudad de fars en el pa s de los rum n los romanos y los griegos de bizancio por extensi n los cristianos un rey llamado yun n era rico y poderoso se or de ej rcitos due o de fuerzas considerables y de aliados de todas las especies de hombres pero su cuerpo padec a una lepra que desesperaba a los m dicos y los sabios ni drogas ni p ldoras ni pomadas le hac an efecto alguno y ning n sabio pudo encontrar un eficaz remedio para la espantosa dolencia pero cierto d a lleg a la capital del rey yun n un m dico anciano de renombre llamado ruy n hab a estudiado los libros griegos persas romanos rabes y sirios as como la medicina y la astronom a cuyos principios y reglas no ignoraba as como sus buenos y malos efectos conoc a las virtudes de las plantas grasas y secas y tambi n sus buenos y malos efectos por ltimo hab a profundizado la filosof a y todas las ciencias m dicas y otras muchas adem s cuando este m dico lleg a la ciudad y permaneci en ella algunos d as supo la historia del rey y de la lepra que le martirizaba por la voluntad de alah enter ndose del fracaso absoluto de todos los m dicos y sabios al tener de ello noticia pas muy preocupado la noche pero no bien despert por la ma ana al brillar la luz del d a y saludar el sol al mundo magn fica decoraci n del optimo se puso su mejor traje y fue a ver al rey yun n bes la tierra entre las manos del rey 1 e hizo votos por la duraci n eterna de su poder o y de las gracias de alah y de todas las mejores cosas despu s le enter de qui n era y le dijo he averiguado la enfermedad que atormenta tu cuerpo y he sabido que un gran n mero de m dicos no ha podido encontrar el medio de curarla voy oh rey a aplicarte mi tratamiento sin hacerte beber medicinas ni untarte con pomadas al o rlo el rey yun n se asombr mucho y le dijo por alah que si me curas te enriquecer hasta los hijos de tus hijos te conceder todos tus deseos y ser s mi compa ero y mi amigo en seguida le dio un hermoso traje y otros presentes y a adi es cierto que me curar s de esta enfermedad sin medicamentos ni pomadas y respondi el otro s ciertamente te curar sin fatiga ni pena para tu cuerpo el rey le dijo cada vez m s asombrado oh gran m dico qu d a y qu momento ver n realizarse lo que acabas de prometer apres rate a hacerlo hijo m o y el m dico contest escucho y obedezco entonces sali del palacio y alquil una casa donde instal sus libros sus remedios y sus plantas arom ticas despu s hizo extractos de sus medicamentos y de sus simples y con estos extractos construy un mazo corto y encorvado cuyo mango horad y tambi n hizo una pelota todo esto lo mejor que pudo terminado completamente su trabajo al segundo d a fue a palacio entr en la c mara del rey y bes la tierra entre sus manos despu s le prescribi que fuera a caballo al meid n 2 y jugara con la bola y el mazo acompa aron al rey sus emires sus chambelanes sus visires y los jefes del reino apenas hab a llegado al meid n se le acerc el m dico y le entreg el mazo dici ndole emp alo de este modo y da con toda tu fuerza en la pelota y haz de modo que llegues a sudar de este modo el remedio penetrar en la palma de la mano y circular por todo tu cuerpo cuando transpires y el remedio haya tenido tiempo de obrar regresa a tu palacio ve en seguida a ba arte al hammam y quedar s curado ahora la paz sea contigo el rey yun n cogi el mazo que le alargaba el m dico empu ndolo con fuerza intr pidos jinetes montaron a caballo y le echaron la pelota entonces empez a galopar detr s de ella para alcanzarla y golpearla siempre con el mazo bien cogido y no dej de golpear hasta que transpir bien por la palma de la mano y por todo el cuerpo dando lugar a que la medicina obrase sobre el organismo cuando el m dico ruy n vio que el remedio hab a circulado suficientemente mand al rey que volviera a palacio para ba arse en el hammam y el rey march en seguida y dispuso que le prepararan el hammam se lo prepararon con gran prisa y los esclavos apresur ronse tambi n a disponerle la ropa entonces el rey entr en el hammam y tom el ba o se visti de nuevo y sali del hammam para montar a caballo volver a palacio y echarse a dormir y hasta aqu lo referente al rey yun n en cuanto al m dico ruy n ste regres a su casa se acost y al despertar por la ma ana fue a palacio pidi permiso al rey para entrar lo que ste le concedi entr bes la tierra entre sus manos y empez por declamar gravemente algunas estrofas si la elocuencia te eligiese como padre reflorecer a y no sabr a elegir ya a otro m s que a ti oh rostro radiante cuya claridad borrar a la llama de un tiz n encendido ojal ese glorioso semblante siga con la luz de su frescura y alcance a ver c mo las arrugas surcan la cara del tiempo me has cubierto con los beneficios de tu generosidad como la nube bienhechora cubre la colina tus altas haza as te han hecho alcanzar las cimas de la gloria y eres el amado del destino que ya no puede negarte nada recitados los versos el rey se puso de pie y cordialmente tendi sus brazos al m dico luego le sent a su lado y le regal magn ficos trajes de honor porque efectivamente al salir del hammam el rey se hab a mirado el cuerpo sin encontrar rastro de lepra y vio su piel tan pura como la plata virgen entonces se dilat con gran j bilo su pecho y al otro d a al levantarse el rey por la ma ana entr en el diw n se sent en el trono y comparecieron los chambelanes y grandes del reino as como el m dico ruy n por esto al verle el rey se levant apresuradamente y le hizo sentar a su lado sirvieron a ambos manjares y bebidas durante todo el d a y al anochecer el rey entreg al m dico dos mil dinares sin contar los trajes de honor y magn ficos presentes y le hizo montar su propio corcel y entonces el m dico se despidi y regres a su casa el rey no dejaba de admirar el arte del m dico ni de decir me ha curado por el exterior de mi cuerpo sin untarme con pomadas oh alah qu ciencia tan sublime fuerza es colmar de beneficios a este hombre y tenerle para siempre como compa ero y amigo afectuoso y el rey yun n se acost muy alegre de verse con el cuerpo sano y libre de su enfermedad cuando al otro d a se levant el rey y se sent en el trono los jefes de la naci n pusi ronse de pie y los emires y visires se sentaron a su derecha y a su izquierda entonces mand llamar al m dico ruy n que acudi y bes la tierra entre sus manos el rey se levant en honor suyo le hizo sentar a su lado comi en su compa a le dese larga vida y le dio magn ficas telas y otros presentes sin dejar de conversar con l hasta el anochecer y mand le entregaran a modo de remuneraci n cinco trajes de honor y mil dinares y as regres el m dico a su casa haciendo votos por el rey al levantarse por la ma ana sali el rey y entr en el diw n donde le rodearon los emires los visires y los chambelanes y entre los visires uno de cara siniestra repulsiva terrible s rdidamente avaro envidioso y saturado de celos y de odio cuando este visir vio que el rey colocaba a su lado al m dico ruy n y le otorgaba tantos beneficios le tuvo envidia y resolvi secretamente perderlo el proverbio lo dice el envidioso ataca a todo el mundo en el coraz n del envidioso est emboscada la persecuci n y la desarrolla si dispone de fuerza o la conserva latente la debilidad el visir se acerc al rey yun n bes la tierra entre sus manos y dijo oh rey del siglo y del tiempo que envuelves a los hombres en tus beneficios tengo para ti un consejo de gran importancia que no podr a ocultarte sin ser un mal hijo si me mandas que te lo revele yo te lo revelar turbado entonces el rey por las palabras del visir le dijo qu consejo es el tuyo el otro respondi oh rey glorioso los antiguos han dicho quien no mire el fin y las consecuencias no tendr a la fortuna por amiga y justamente acabo de ver al rey obrar con poco juicio otorgando sus bondades a su enemigo al que desea el aniquilamiento de su reino colm ndole de favores abrum ndole con generosidades y yo por esta causa siento grandes temores por el rey al o r esto el rey se turb extremadamente cambi de color y dijo qui n es el que supones enemigo m o y colmado por mis favores y el visir respondi oh rey si est s dormido despierta porque aludo al m dico ruy n el rey dijo ese es buen amigo m o y para m el m s querido de los hombres pues me ha curado con una cosa que yo he tenido en la mano y me ha librado de mi enfermedad que hab a desesperado a los m dicos ciertamente que no hay otro como l en este siglo en el mundo entero lo mismo en occidente que en oriente c mo te atreves a hablarme as de l desde ahora le voy a se alar un sueldo de mil dinares al mes y aunque le diera la mitad de mi reino poco ser a para lo que merece creo que me dices todo eso por envidia como se cuenta en la historia que he sabido del rey sindabad en aquel momento la aurora sorprendi a schehrazada que interrumpi su narraci n entonces doniazada le dijo ah hermana m a cu n dulces cu n puras cu n deliciosas son tus palabras y schehrazada dijo qu es eso comparado con lo que os contar la noche pr xima si vivo todav a y el rey tiene a bien conservarme entonces el rey dijo para s por alah no la matar sin haber o do la continuaci n de su historia que es verdaderamente maravillosa luego pasaron ambos la noche enlazados hasta por la ma ana y el rey fue al diw n y juzg otorg destituy y despach los asuntos pendientes hasta acabarse el d a despu s se levant el diw n y el rey entr en su palacio y cuando se aproxim la noche hizo su cosa acostumbrada con schehrazada la hija del visir

6139266 the play is harsh unrelenting at times grotesque and exceedingly refreshing in a more perfect universe every city would have a theater troupe that performed plays like embedded every time there was a national crisis see it before the constitution goes the way of the geneva conventions if you dont believe that the live theater can be a potent political instrument see this play and change your mind

6139268 the script and the production both fare best during the very human vignettes a touching opening scene has soldiers saying goodbye to their loved ones as they go off to war one of the few ethical reporters played appealingly by meg heimstead recounts with fear and sadness an errant bomb attack a fictionalized account of the jessica lynch story with a poignant performance by betty jane parks is perhaps the shows most profound and effective anti war statement some of the best acting comes during those repeated segments with the presidential advisers even though the actors faces are hidden behind masks their gestures are phenomenally evocative

6139276 the americans were very clever they sent rockets into space and invented machines which could think more quickly than any human being alive but all this cleverness could also make them blind they did not understand other people they thought that everyone looked at things in the same way as americans did but they were wrong

6139299 the governments response to soaring energy prices has been woefully complacent
6139300 the planned rise in the winter fuel payment is dwarfed by the rise that households are likely to see in their bills these increases hit the elderly and the most vulnerable the hardest while energy companies receive a 9bn windfall
6139301 immediate action is needed so that vulnerable customers are guaranteed the best price that their supplier offers cuts in the warm front insulation programme must be reversed and the energy companies must be forced to drive up standards of home energy efficiency
6139302 for businesses soaring fuel prices could be the straw that breaks the camels back we need a competitive energy market so that businesses can shop around and get the best price

6139323 were told that the purpose of the trial was to measure the gastrointestinal safety of vioxx
6139324 six hundred investigators enrolled and randomly assigned 2 785 patients with osteoarthritis to vioxx and 2 772 patients to naproxen for a three month trial
6139325 were to provide product trial among key physician group sic to accelerate uptake of vioxx as the second entrant in a highly competitive new class and gather data important to this customer group the trial was designed and executed in the spirit of the merck marketing principles as described below
6139326 designed to seem as if they answer a scientific question but primarily fulfill marketing objectives
6139327 physicians have been recruited to participate in marketing studies in order to allow them to become familiar with a drug
6139328 and thats what happened here this trial allowed physicians to have experience with vioxx but as far as i know our paper is the first to show how a pharmaceutical company planned and executed a seeding trial there are documents showing how merck could have gained an advantage but whats troubling is that physicians and patients werent told of the objective of the trial and thats problematic because patients risk their health when they are signed up for such a trial instead of advancing the cause of science
6139329 result in less quality control from investigators and use of sites that have less research experience than academic centers or community physicians offices

6139346 during the dinner mary kate was very playful with joel it was all fun and games but with the olsens nothing is as simple as that nicole exploded at joel and demanded that they leave the party afterward nicole warned him to stay away from mary kate

6139364 it just has to stop its gotten completely out of control

6139366 in the past mostly the attitude was more is better that may be a little different now
6139367 people have been worried about the budget deficit people have been worried about government waste they might not look kindly on maximizing the flow of public monies to constituencies
6139368 i dont expect my senate colleagues to tell kansas what our priority projects should be and i dont think i should be telling other states what their priorities should be

6139377 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6139378 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 per cent of the blame rests with us
6139379 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6139380 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6139381 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6139382 dont tell me any of you took last weeks top 5 seriously
6139383 this recognition means a great deal to our firm our employees and to our clients
6139384 we were extremely pleased to see that we not only ranked number 12 out of more than 475 leading financial advisory firms across the nation but that we also ranked highest among colorado firms for the fourth straight year

6139393 were trying to identify in the trichoplax genes that are also found in other animals our genome and the fruit fly genome and so on
6139394 a big effort and a big investment and so we have to choose carefully
6139395 the motivation for choosing this animal was its phylogenetic position
6139396 a tiny little pancake of cells you can barely see without a microscope
6139397 and theyre extremely simple about as simple as you can be just a disc of cells thats two layers thick
6139398 well thats one of the main questions im going after now that im setting up my own lab
6139399 is there a reason theyre together and if they get separated by a mutation does that disrupt some mechanism of gene regulation or cause some other problem for an organism
6139400 but its a very clear question and ive decided to try to find the answer to that
6139401 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6139402 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6139403 the intestine may be an ideal site for msc therapy given its rapid ability to regrow tissue and its extensive local supply of lymph nodes and the route by which the cells were administered may have ensured a greater amount of engraftment in gut associated lymph nodes
6139404 before we can think about testing this approach in patients we need to know more about long term effects of msc infusion including immunosuppressive effects and gain more understanding of how mscs modulate immune cell activity in more realistic models of inflammatory bowel disease
6139405 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
6139406 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
6139407 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6139408 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6139409 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6139410 coherent population trapping of an electron spin in a single negatively charged quantum dot
6139411 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and for their integrity
6139412 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6139413 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6139414 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6139415 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6139416 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6139417 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid
6139418 we wanted to draw attention not to a prevalent threat but to a possible future one
6139419 youre asking hundreds of thousands or millions of people to wear something every day for a theoretical risk
6139420 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity
6139421 take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6139422 obesity is occurring at epidemic rates in the u s and worldwide and that impacts the risk and prognosis of many diseases
6139423 we hope this study can be translated into applications to help treat or prevent obesity
6139424 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain in the body
6139425 diet and exercise are still the best approaches for weight reduction in the general population
6139426 however for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity these approaches may have very little effect
6139427 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp 7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
6139428 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6139429 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6139430 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits
6139431 with the end of moores law in sight mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after
6139432 i have two little children and now they have been robbed of their father because of me i know its my fault our marriage went on the rocks and im so miserable about it day in and day out that i just dont know what to do
6139433 you dont know how many times ive wept before the lord i know i was wrong and ive truly repented
6139434 and you know that youre saved that youre a child of god through faith in christ
6139435 thats what makes my mistakes so hard to bear i accepted christ as my savior when i was a child but i got away from him and you make a lot of foolish mistakes when youre not living for the lord now i just hate myself i cant stand myself
6139436 jennifer the bible says in first john 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness do you believe that
6139437 yes i know the bible says that and i want to believe it and i guess i do but i cant help hating myself for having made such a mess of my life and of my childrens
6139438 if god forgives you shouldnt you be willing to forgive yourself do you know what jesus said were the two great commandments they are love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and love your neighbor as yourself
6139439 jennifer do you think you can fully obey that command to love your neighbor as yourself if you dont love yourself if you continue hating yourself it will affect all your relationships with your fellow man wont it
6139440 well hatred toward other people should have no part in a christians life jennifer
6139441 certainly we should hate sin as god does but we should also love the sinner as god does and you will not be able to obey the second great commandment unless you forgive yourself and go on from there with the lord all the brooding in the world over your past mistakes will not make you a better christian will it but if you have learned something from your mistakes and if you have rededicated your life to the lord then you can look forward to a future of living for him and training your children in the way they should go do you understand
6139442 it does no good to continue beating yourself over the head
6139443 i guess our time is about up and we never did get to talk about writing
6139444 the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin

6139446 making it a genuinely mature game for a new world of adult gamers
6139447 i think there were two things going on from last year and one was that it was an extraordinary year that i dont think we got to savor and enjoy
6139448 we accomplished something special as a team and organization last year under tremendous scrutiny more scrutiny than any team has ever been under
6139449 we went 16 0 we won 18 straight games and then the 19th game ended so abruptly that all of us have had a sick feeling in our stomach
6139450 i think in 10 15 years from now when people look back and start to realize what happened here it probably will never happen again no i think there will be afc champs who lose the super bowl to an underdog again i cant say it wont but you have to have a confluence of so many things coming together we wanted to congratulate the team and the coaches for what they accomplished
6139451 it was a very special and historic year and i want them to look back with pride when they look at the ring and remember the week to week approach
6139452 when youre in a season youre always moving on to the next game the next challenge and because there is always something ahead you never look back i thought it was a good time to talk about it and acknowledge it and also talk about how i appreciated their approach and superior performance they gave throughout the year
6139453 it seems he may have misunderstood the concept behind matsugen its commitment to pure authentic japanese cooking
6139454 theres more to it than building a high recycling rate our schools are helping to create a sustainable community in the long run
6139455 the go green program is really about developing awareness of resource management and environmental stewardship among students and throughout the student teacher parent community
6139456 instranets dimensions technology is a killer world class application that puts context around information so data appears quickly and is relevant and it can be implemented at scale
6139457 instranet gets customers up and running very quickly and we are very big on getting customers up and running quickly rather than putting them through some two year slog
6139458 the acquisition of instranet will throw gasoline on the fire we have got going in a marketplace that is prime for growth
6139459 if i steadily make 5 000 every month online is it okay if i stop working
6139460 sure in that case can i be your house husband
6139461 why not at least wed both be home with the kids
6139462 certainly resonates with a lot of computer enthusiasts not only do the games we play and the applications we use require more and more computational chutzpah to perform well but the silicon bits themselves are not shy about sucking down the wattage to do it
6139463 i know you are wrong but your argument is perfect
6139464 emotionally forcing the other person to listen to respect you
6139465 you are yelling and your hands are trembling again you are losing control you are just angry and not thinking straight
6139466 remember when you didnt call on friday night and you were out late how inconsiderate was that

6139468 im looking forward to working with these two distinguished new yorkers on the power authority board
6139469 the experience that they bring in key areas of law and finance will be a great asset to helping guide the power authority in carrying out its responsibilities as the nations largest state owned power organization
6139470 new york state will be well served by the leadership and expertise that judge nicandri and jonathan foster are bringing to the power authority as our newest trustees
6139471 their decades of experience in key areas underpinning our operations along with demonstrated good judgment will contribute to the vital role we play in supporting the goals of governor paterson for reliable clean and economical power

6139684 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy not even a representative democracy

6139688 i do not know much but i have also heard about it
6139689 there was a guy who rang me and told me about rangers but i referred them only to my agent martin dahlin

6139691 all eyes are on warners initiative to cut catalogue prices
6139692 other studios and the retailers are going to be watching consumer reaction to this very carefully
6139693 i would be amazed if we dont see a blu ray player in the u s at or below 250 by the end of this year
6139694 in order to stimulate consumer traffic in the holiday season whos to say there wont be a product at closer to 200 in the uk player prices will fall to around 149 and there may be one or two companies trying to better that
6139695 i have not just come here to play and then leave again
6139696 it is my hope that i do well enough for rangers that they want to sign me and keep me here on a permanent deal
6139697 my first target is to simply play good football in training and get into the team as i have come here to be successful
6139698 i am not even thinking about a life beyond rangers you never know what will happen in your career over time but i want to be here
6139699 i am only focused on working hard so that the club takes up its option to buy me and i am here for many years
6139700 of course given that we have now increased the squad that will mean that some players are going to be unhappy because they are not getting a game
6139701 so some of them may leave during this transfer window and that may be an obvious thing
6139702 there are a few in that category and i think they would like permanent moves rather than loans

6139722 internet radio better stop its whining and start organizing into

6139727 good on him for having the courage to make a stand about this
6139728 i like to encourage people and say you can land it and then they do
6139729 as long as he didnt put himself in danger we commend that kind of community spirit
6139730 it shows the skate park has instilled a real pride in the younger members of our community
6139731 take pride in the streets reserves and facilities we have
6139732 is currently operating in excess of its approved overdraft limit with the bank of new zealand and is therefore in default of its facility and security arrangements
6139733 it would be premature however to speculate what the timing and outcome of a sales process might be
6139734 they touch rails and door knobs and then they handle food
6139735 i wonder if we got these sorts of outbreaks 20 years ago when cleaning was all done in house and closely managed
6139736 we think our guys do a good job in the circumstances
6139737 we are pleased to advise that we are targeting finalising this plan before the end of august which is an efficient timetable as it is important to provide more certainty for you as soon as possible
6139738 we understand that people are keen to quantify the support the shareholders watson and hotchin will offer on top of the equity they already have in the company
6139739 the board believes that this should maximise the returns available for investors over time
6139740 the year brought considerable change for the group beginning with the distraction of a takeover offer and continuing through a lengthy sell down of non core assets
6139741 the key drivers of thls revenue are completely out of their hands

6139746 i rung her up and said we may have some things in common
6139747 when my daughter grows up i hope she gets to see something like this again
6139748 i think were all prejudiced to a certain extent im not arrogant enough to say im not
6139749 i know ive got my own fair share of them prejudices but i try to work through them
6139750 in all those years the only thing i was ever judged on was my ability to do the job
6139751 as long as i could deliver i think thats all that mattered
6139752 either way its good news to have the community card and our slot on the game in new zealand
6139753 queenstown is this little kiwi town that was up against london paris and new york big cities and big competition
6139754 to win recognition with a community chest card as the adventure capital of the world is quite an achievement and to merit the creation of a special kiwi bonus pack is incredible testament to our reputation as the leading lake and alpine destination in the southern hemisphere
6139755 that money cant buy and we hope it inspires visitors to come and discover queenstown for themselves
6139756 so far this month there were 27 cases of schools needing teacher relief which we could not fill because we didnt have enough staff to go around
6139757 on average this month there have been two positions per day unable to be filled
6139758 the situation is critical at the moment we are having relief teachers who are not feeling 100 continuing to work we need more relievers were desperate
6139759 people are getting in a panic for no good reason

6139770 this valuation reflects a discount in the range of 20 to recognise that despite the fact that pggw will become the owner of 50 of the shares in sff if the proposed transaction is successful it will not have the control that would normally accompany a shareholding of that level
6139771 grant samuel believes that existing shareholders are not being disadvantaged by pggw acquiring a 50 shareholding on balance having a committed partner to assist with a complex transition that has the potential to bring significant benefits to both parties should be viewed positively by existing shareholders
6139772 the loss of outright control is not material in grant samuels opinion pggw is a business totally dependent on the rural community
6139773 supplier shareholders ceding some control to pggw is a small trade off to pay for the benefits the proposed transaction is seeking to deliver suppliers sff and pggw
6139774 pggw is to a very large extent a locked in shareholder with virtually no ability to increase its shareholding or influence and only limited ability to realise its investment

6139806 over time paper and packaging companies have been together in many instances and in most cases they lost their shirt in this combination
6139807 from the logical point of view and how you operate the paper industry is global so you make paper reels and that can travel to asia or back when you make packaging you have to actually respect that the packagings cannot travel very long so you actually have almost an opposite way of looking at the world
